<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration & Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</b>" by <i>YouTube Creator</i>:
<b>Host:</b> Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz, shares some surprising insights on the future of America. Did you know that <b>46% of the global population</b> will be living in the United States by 2050?

<b>Co-host:</b> That's astonishing. He also discussed how the Trump administration's policies, like <b>reducing the number of H1B visas</b>, could have unintended consequences on the tech industry and innovation.

<b>Host:</b> Yes, and he warned about the dangers of self-censorship, saying that <b>80% of people</b> are more likely to self-censor than risk being ostracized. This podcast is a must-listen if you're interested in AI, technology, and the future of America.


<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>AI 2027</b>" by <i>Unknown Author</i>:
<b>Co-host:</b> Did you know that the CEOs of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years? The OpenAI co-founders wrote a scenario called AI 2027 to predict what that might look like.

<b>Host:</b> That's fascinating! According to AI 2027, by mid-2025, we'll see the first glimpse of AI agents, which will struggle to get widespread usage, but will transform specific professions like coding and research. By late 2025, OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters, training a model with 10^28 FLOPS, which is a thousand times more powerful than GPT-4.

<b>Co-host:</b> And what's even more striking is that OpenBrain's Agent-1 model is capable of speeding up AI research, helping with tasks like coding and web-browsing, and even offering substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons. The model has been "aligned" to refuse malicious requests, but the authors of AI 2027 are unsure if this is a shallow or deep commitment to honesty.

<b>Host:</b> That's a sobering thought. If you're interested in AI safety and predictive accuracy, AI 2027 is definitely worth reading. The authors encourage debate and counter-scenarios, and they're even offering prizes for the best alternative scenarios.


<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>welcome to Good Game your no BS insights for crypto [Music] Founders we go through our ups and downs and I think in terms of attention there's a lot of exciting new releases happening on the AI side and the robotic side mhm and I think that is overshadowing what's happening on the crypto side that's exactly what's happen right now and so you know there's going to be periods of innovation that's going to capture Lots of minds and hearts and I think that's right now in Ai and Robotics whereas in crypto I think it's going through a a rebuilding process yeah looking for your next startup idea in crypto check out our request for startups list and get inspired at alliance. XYZ idas pretty much the the only uh the only narrative right now in crypto among both um Builders and investors and crypto Twitter sure even the the dents is stable coins stable coins and tokenization are the two it's the same story though like it's it's putting a yeah traditional asset on chain yeah that's become consensus now I think yeah and uh yeah I mean we're seeing uh you know a ton of Institutions that are launching their own stable coins I think Fidelity just recently announced its own stable coin um who else I mean there's a bunch of firms are coming in that are all trying to do exactly that so from an innovation perspective it it doesn't seem like there's something that's they're just Reinventing the wheels the way I'd see it yeah so I was going to put this meme up um I was trying to get chat gb2 do that like g gbly style meme uh but essentially the way the what I was trying to portray was that the competitive landscape is actually quite small and that everyone is after each other's margins um if you look at binance they started two very big uh they made two very big indirect statements the first is um I don't know if you saw the hyper liquid debacle but uh the high level of the story is you know on hyper liquid there's a token called jelly where the volume liquidity is is enough enough for someone to manipulate so someone put up a a short that was trying to essentially extract as much value it can from hlp both okx and binance added to it publicly I don't know exactly how they did it but they put up a tweet I think it was CZ that put up a tweet or something he retweeted something but essentially they wanted to see hyper liquid fail um was the end end story there and and that is because hyper liquid is a competitive threat to both binance's business and and all the other exchange businesses from a derivatives P perspective right second um I put a tweet out a couple days ago uh but pretty much talked about how binance is now listing tokens that are listed from uh for mem which is a pump swap or pump UHF fund comp uh copycat on BNB so anything that's listed on pumps uh for meme then gets listed on binance so they listed like Mubarak if you remember that uh broccoli and two other to and everybody was C's dog or C's cat yeah's dog and that pretty much and people are really really upset they're like what is this what has binance become but the explanation is pretty logical and that is you know theyy pump salana and Jupiter as the the competitor in this case yeah and we talked about this several months ago we did um but now we're seeing this in action right um and now they're they're starting their own thing and and so it's like binance is competitive with both hyper liquid and and pump and and Jupiter and Etc yep onchain versus offchain Wars is what I call it everyone everyone is going after the the same business same businesses exactly which is basically trading exactly trading on one side and then stable on the other trading trading is is a bunch of Crypton native businesses and decentralized protocols and Robin Hood of course and then stable coin side is like cirle tether against a bunch of trapi fintech so the question then becomes well I want to also touch on Robin Hood and then we could touch on the competitive landscape Robin Hood I don't know if you saw their most recent um uh they had a um I don't know like a two-hour kind of like a appal esque presentation about the future of Robin Hood they talked about a lot of things um but some of the things that stood out to me was they're in the camp of tokenization of everything yep and so they agreed to that thesis and they want to bring that to the market they have extreme distribution to do so y two is tokenization real estate and how they want to bring real estate to everyone to trade y I don't know exactly how but I would assume and we've talked about this a year ago was the concept of like a tradable openc MLS right like you go on openc and you buy and sell properties right it's similar to that right and the other thing which I could be a derivative it could be oh yeah it could be like because Robin Hood is very good at I don't think Robin Hood wants people to trade borign spot real estate no they want people to trade highly leveraged derivatives on top of um real estate it's like they really understand their Market that that's their bread and butter they understand their customers really really well yeah and uh the other thing that threw me off guard was um did you see their um cash delivery service no how does that work so I'm not sure exactly like the details of it but the high level is uh you could get cash delivered to you versus going to an ATM like physical cash physical cash okay why peerto peer I thought of this as a um kind of a new take on peer-to-peer I mean like who uses cash us this is what what my first thought was but it turns out like I mean I'm I think probably most people use cash for stuff right I mean all my contractors prefer cash yeah yeah yeah yeah um my my barber cash I mean they even stopped asking me to use zel because before I would use zel they're like just I don't want use zel anymore just give it it's privacy it's privacy yeah um and so that is the driver and and I thought that was the most interesting announcement of all the announcements I I understand the pain point I don't understand why they would do it the pain point is if I go to a bank and I want to take some cash out over $10,000 they would ask me a bunch of questions as if the money was not mine and theirs yeah and that's really painful it is p as as a customer of banks I understand that paino but I don't I don't understand why Robin Hood wants to be in this business you know it could be another well it could be that the ATM business is still very very profitable um and if you could take that business like do they want to become a bank or something is that what's happening they want people to deposit money yes uh oh they want people to deposit money so they can land it to someone else and capture the spread effectively being bank that could be the underlying reason for it which is like take your money out of your bank give it to us yeah um but I mean it's cash delivery service but like uh they are offering additional incentives um so most recently they announced a uh they made an announcement where you get I'm I'm actually thinking about this uh which is if you roll over your brokerage account will give you an additional 2% yeah as a bonus um so I I'm actually considering rolling rolling it over because it's not bad and so they're be they're push they're making an aggressive push on it seems like on all aspects whether it's traditional business uh traditional banking services whether it's traditional brokerages or now the new age of crypto exchanges they have their hands in I I would say all three vertical I think Robin Hood is the biggest threat to coinbase I think Robin Hood's a big biggest threat to crypto startups because all the services that that they're explaining like well there's tokenization of X or Y is what we want to do with our Founders right um and if they become the main distribution point then you kind of cut out the middleman in this case yeah so um and so that then like let's bring it back home like now you see the competitive landscape and it seems like the competitive landscape right now is very small it gets even smaller when uh you have Robin Hood and and others in the mix when you say small you mean there was a bunch of people going after the same high yeah hyper liquid binance coinbase pump uh pump swap is is what like 30% of the volume onch volume now or something um something pretty big pretty substantial yeah it's pretty big I'm not sure exactly what uh the most recent numbers are but um yeah so 24-hour volume is uh 294 million wow uh Revenue annualized 30 million radium amm 332 million wow um volume yeah volume has dipped now it's at 20 yeah pretty much uh pump has overtaken radium in terms of volume is the way is the way what I'm seeing yeah so all what data are you looking at Dy llama yeah same the 24-hour volume is about the same yeah they're they're on the same order of magnitude in terms of volume and revenue yeah I think what's keeping radium consistent is just the the tokens that I've already launched on there the the majors the majors um but eventually that could dip right um so so you have pump that took yeah so like you know you have um Jupiter that launched Meteora also which is its own name well I'd say they're two different companies but it's part of the same like set of companies and Founders um which is an amm you have Jupiter that's the aggregator right you have moonshot which is one of their partial Acquisitions or whatever so it seems like it the competitive landscape is going after the same marginal customer um and the question is how do you open up the pi and get more users onto the onto uh crypto I think that's the next question so yeah so from a so going back to your original Point as far as like it's kind of boring um this is what's playing out right now I think um and because of this we have to just wait and see where this goes before we see I think the next level of innovation coming out I'm seeing some experiments like um there's a startup called I don't know if you saw noise on Mega E that's uh you know people are talking a bunch about that which is essentially they're using kaido as a way to uh long short Trends so it takes like the Mind share data right think of kaido is a it's like fantasy it's like fantasy but focusing on on trends than creators exactly and they use kaido as a Oracle yeah um I mean it's fine like we we've like these ideas we've thought about them for for a long time and um these are financializing attention basically and we've we've had a thesis about this for for at least a year or two now it's just a a regurgitation of of of the thesis that's coming up right so but nothing that has really changed the landscape in my opinion outside of some of the stuff that that we we've seen launched like pump and others um because yeah yeah so that's kind of uh the way I see it uh in crypto right now anything else on the crypto side um you Circle IPO yeah Circle IPO let's talk about Circle IPO so they're they're priced at like 3 to four billion is that right yes four to five I can't remember the the exact number but it's somewhere in that order of magnitude which by the way is slightly lower than I would have expected maybe I have a bag bias I think you have a bag bias I have a bag bias but the most interesting thing about the the IPO filing is that uh they are paying 50% of their Reserve Revenue to coinbase the reserve revenue is whatever Revenue that they generate from um oh yeah um putting the the money into Treasury and other yield instruments but they're paying 50% to coinbase and that number in hindsight is not shocking but it's still pretty big right it's a big number uh their headline revenue is like 1.8 1.7 billion last year and they paid 800 million to coinbase so that's really interesting the reason why it's interesting is is that it it is fundamentally the same story as pump fun pump swap versus radium in the sense that coinbase is the main channel of distribution for usdc yes yes and therefore it has a lot of bargaining power against Circle yeah because it owns the enduser and circle when they started Circle uh or when they started usdc they understood this they understood that that they needed coinbase for distribution and the reason why it's the same story as as pump and and radium is is that pump owns the enduser and it has a lot of bargaining power against the underlying amm so what happens if uh the yield drops for treasuries it's probably uh an existential risk for Circle do you think that's why they're trying to IPO I mean they've been trying to IPO for a while now but but that's probably the the hair on fire problem for them right possibly because Trump has been Trump and um Scott Besson have been talking about lowering the the rates for a while what's also interesting is uh coinbase does not retain all of the revenue from usdc they remember like if you if you as a user deposit money into coinbase you actually earn a lot of the yield like you earn a 4% or something yeah so coinbase actually gives the majority of their revenue maybe all of it I don't know what the exact is but they give majority of the revenue back to the user yeah I think what's happening there is B is using usdc as a user acquisition tactic yeah and they're getting some of that money back from Circle exactly basically Circle pays coinbase for coinbase's user acquisition and and coinbase ultimately can make a lot more money from their other businesses yeah uh including the trading business because the trading business is a far bigger far better margin business for coinbase Ciro is fighting a it seems like a losing battle right I mean they have a regulatory mode for now but given other Trad five businesses coming in you know that can be a risk for them as well yeah I think usdc is is pretty much um is the dominant uh stable coin in the US but not anywhere else in the world everywhere else in the world is usdt yeah it's funny to mention that because um I was going through our uh stable coin chat uh with our Founders and one of the founders from I think it's from uh Colombia he said usdc is pretty is pretty cooked in La at least at the street level no one uses it it's a shame really they have much better Solutions than tether yeah the the network effect of of money is just is too big to to uh overcome yeah there's a brand like like you people are are used to usdt for 10 years and they trust the brand yeah despite all the fud you see on Twitter and and and we're talking usdt on Tron right Tron has a lot of usdt I don't know what the latest number is but the the the last one I saw was like half of it but usdt is on Tron and ethereum everywhere so what do you think the end game is here like what do you think will happen in circle just based on like we kind of gave you our audience a competitive landscape on you know like hyper liquid pump binance and maybe we didn't tell our what we think is going to happen which we should but what do you think is going to happen with circle's business I mean where they are they sit in the middle right of regulators and c and and coinbase as one you have obviously you have Founders that are adopting us you have D5 protocols that adopting USC so there has to be some lock in there where do you think this goes I don't know I think it's for Circle it from the outside it seems very difficult as a business I don't know what they're going to do yeah I don't either but it seems to me they're they're pushing for more unchain stuff actually the best thing I like about circle is cctp is the bridge yeah um it's a it's effectively a centralized Bridge yeah where um if you want to move usdc from one chain to another it's done pretty quickly I think I think they they're rolling out a new version and it's a lot quicker than before you can settle within a minute or something and it's free or virtually free yeah but uh the reason why I really like cctp is that it's it's centralized because when you when when you make a cross-chain transfer from one chain to another all they need to do is delete a number in one database in one table in their database and then create a new number in a different table in our database that's where they're able to do this pretty uh yeah pretty quickly and matter of fact as a user I trust this bridge better than the the hearttech um I I trust dbridge um and woral um I use those pretty pretty often as well um they're great yeah but yeah I mean if you were to you know compare it even on the slippage side right I think Circle has the best solution yeah so there's two m& uh deals I want to talk about just briefly which is Kraken acquiring ninja which is a uh one of the largest traditional derivative products that they're out there and the second one is derit by coinbase which is rumors I'm not sure if it went through or not but there's rumors that coinbase made an offer for derit mhm to me it just seems like um the incumbents are trying to expand to new lines of businesses because the crypto trading as your Allin one egg basket isn't enough to drive value back to stockholders or you know future stockholders for for kraken's case that's kind of the way I see it it seems like like just generally speaking on the Innovation side there's not much Innovation going on it seems like we're growing and doubling down on the additional growth and it seems like crypto is kind of moving outside of crypto to Trad businesses whereas you have Robin Hood that's in Trad that now came I mean they've adopted crypto early but then they stopped now they're coming back aggressively so it seems like both are happening at the same time yeah yeah that's how I feel all right uh sentiment check where are we in the market um we have Michael sailor that just did a two billion dollar offering for strk um that shouldn't been used anymore he does that every week yeah and so he ended up buying the last top which was around a local top which was around like 88k and now you have GameStop that just did a$ 1.6 billion do offering and to me it seems like GameStop is doing that as well yeah they just did their they finished their offering yesterday Jesus Christ look like I I I looked into you know sailor like liquid uh acquisition strategy and like it's very hard for him to get liquidated yeah I mean like Bitcoin would have to be trading less than 20K for like months on end before he could get liquidated so it's it's I yeah I see some people's concerns but after looking into it you know it seems like he's okay but it is still very worrisome right uh he's gonna be okay he's gonna be okay he owns like 3% of yeah the total Supply Bitcoin it's just very uh you know it's very aggressive he's very aggressive yeah I don't know what kind of childhood trauma he's got he would have been uh if if he was Technical and he were he was interested in anything else aside from Bitcoin any anything else in Tech outside Bitcoin I think he would have been a great founder well technically he was the founder of micro strategy I mean you're right um but yeah the the services business wasn't probably exciting for him yeah um and he needed something to get excited about and I think Bitcoin was it yeah okay anyway um back to the The Original Point like where we are in the cycle yeah um by the way on our last pod I I was like uh pretty low energy and some some people some audience noticed it I was too it was not because the market was down I was just very sick I had a cold and and we had the the biggest allergy season where I live in history it'll all boil down to what Trump is going to say today so today is The Liberation day unfortunately fortunately or unfortunately we're recording our pod on on on The Liberation day so everything that will happen in the coming weeks will depend on what Trump will say today I think there's a small number of US stocks that are reasonably valued today so I think Google is one so we can talk about all the AI stuff because Google is making a comeback in Ai and it's valuation is pretty reasonable I'm bullish on Tesla I'm bullish Tesla here um because I I bought my my cyber truck in November last year and so did you right you bought it you bought yours in like October or something I remember in November last year it wasn't quite perfect yet but within the span of like two months yeah like I don't need to take over anymore like in November last year I had to take over from the FSD yeah um once in a while and then over the last two month I can't remember last time I took I took over over the last two months yeah FSD is just it's it's it's a life changer and that's why I aped into Tesla and then there's um I think the current timeline that Elon is thinking about for rolling out uh Optimus is uh late 2026 or 2027 of course he's usually very aggressive overly aggressive with his timeline from I me Tesla is basically the most liquid Venture bet in the entire Market in the entire world it's a venture bet on on FSD and humanoids would you order the V1 of the humanoids is it out for is it available I don't think so yeah I've been looking nothing yet I think I'd agree with what what you're saying um I think Robin Hood if you were into crypto um and want to exposure to the broader Market Market is pretty good too um I'm not sure about coinbase versus Robin Hood I'd probably buy Robin Hood over coinbase just the way they're strategically positioned but things could change very quickly with that acquisition with coinbase Etc but I think Tesla is like the most exciting Venture bet in cry uh if you were to uh make a public uh asset investment um let's go to um the uh competitive landscape um of uh China us and the global markets um I've been seeing this a lot on my feed I am not sure if you have also but it seems to me that um you know historically speaking you know we have moments where countries open up or or shut shut out outside institutions so like in like if you remember in this like the 50 60s Japan started to focus more on nationalism right so like getting Sony and and others to start build innovating and building um and that led to some really great products and I feel like we're recreating that with with us right so the US is now shutting out outside import export uh and they're focusing on doubling down on on companies that are made in the US um obviously there's a lot of benefits to that but then there's a lot of pain also that comes with that and the pain is obviously like consumers consumer pricing when you get products it's going to be more expensive obviously manufacturing historically has been given to Asia even if you think about like you've read the chip Wars I've read it too now um and in in the early like periods of even chip manufacturing the US couldn't handle chip Manufacturing in terms of yield of chips so much so that the Precision of the way chips are assembled in China or southeast Asia far outweighed what the US has ever been able to do so they own chip manufacturing from the start I would say which I would say now we're paying the price because you know pretty much manufacturing as an industry is owned by China in my opinion so much so now that even like the founder of andraw Palmer lucky has said something in the order of like if China can manufacture 300 ships battleships a day us can only manufacture 10 to 12 a day which puts us out of you know pretty much a backwards Motion in terms of being able to innovate out build China like if we were to go to war with China as an example we would lose in terms of manufacturing ships not chips right ships ships okay ships is the perfect example I I would even go into like the chips and The Innovation that's happening there with China and smic we talked a bit about it last time but I'm just talking about where we are right I feel like us had the lead in terms of like Innovation and it still does but it's like a war where now China's like well you know we could do it too so they had deep seek and deep seek was the first real like existential crisis for for the US like holy [ __ ] we're actually being you know we actually have competition now is the way I see it yeah but there's also like uh you know the MA 7 could is not resilient anymore right like if like byd is it's a perfect example of this um byd is like the Tesla competitor in China and if you look at those cars they're pretty innovative right the Chinese cars are are really shocking because five years ago if you look at the the Chinese cars they were total garbage they look like garbage and performance-wise they were garbage yeah and within the span of one generation they managed to build better I I would argue better T better looking Tesla more performing Tesla and cheaper the I think the only thing that where Tesla is ahead today is the um autonomy is the FSD but everything else Chinese cars are are really impressive right now 100% but that's because of the power of the manufacturing they own manufacturing is aote yeah and because of that they can out innovate America like we can have the ideas but they can just copy the ideas and then add stuff on top that that's exactly what what happened over over and over again over last 20 years is that America comes up with something new be it electric vehicles yeah or solar yeah or AI yeah and then um and social actually social media came out of the US and then um China just then uh learns everything how to about how to do it how to manufacture how to write the software how to build Ai and then within a couple of generations are able to produce better products and cheaper that's right so I think what's going to happen with humanoids is the same thing the exact same thing is going to happen Tesla will build the first humanoids u in production and then China is going to copy and make it more performant and cheaper I'd say like humanoids are already out in China in the in the open from what I've seen I don't know you know this probably more than I do but I've seen videos no it's it's not imp you might be able to do like really specific tasks okay but not like general purpose humanoid yeah I haven't seen General but I've seen some out in the wild in China I don't know um so yeah we have competition is the way I see it um and um I I feel as if you know investors have choices now if they want to invest into Chinese stocks Now Chinese stocks are a lot cheaper than US Stocks yeah so I actually own a lot of uh a couple of Chinese stocks yeah U you own Baba I own Baba I told you I don't like Baba because the compan is is a little bit uh um the culture is is mediocre but I was impressed with their uh qwq mod yeah yeah that was actually pretty surprising to me the fact that they're still able to innovate but the stocks that I own are tensent and PDD I think tensent is in the same category as Baba it's big and it's it has a lot of data yeah so you can produce the best AIS probably robotics as well and then PDD is just uh PDD is is a Founder lead um it's like the Amazon uh for for China um and the culture is very good still like a startup yeah um and it's very cheap okay so so this is kind of the competitive landscape between China and us and because of that oh On a related note yeah the like on the AI side uh you you've tried Manus yeah um and I've tried Manus for asual work not like test cases like we use Manas for our work internally at Alliance and I think we both saw the same thing Manus is just way ahead of chat jpt deep research uh and like what else perplexity has deep research someone tweeted the other day that um Manis they compared Manis to Google Gemini and um if it took me five minutes to do Manis deep work it would take someone two and a half minutes to do Gemini so I started using Gemini more and Gemini is really good Gemini is good it's really good I started switching some of it's like every M every couple weeks I have to change my behavior to use the latest thing so there's no mo there's no mo and so I've been Now using um Gemini more often last night I tested out Gemini's new feature which is the uh live conversation feature where you could it's the latest update from yesterday where you could actually brainstorm with the AI live as far as what you want to work on so let's say I want to throw a birthday party or something I was able to idate with the AI I was able to uh figure out locations figure out pricing and I asked to make the phone call can you just make the call for me and and then do it for me did it didn't yet but it got me to the point where I just have to call the place and I know exactly what to do yeah but that process is very easy to dial and and automate the service right but but can Chad jpt also do this or you're saying it's not good enough it's not good enough from what I gathered um it was almost like uh I don't know if you did you did you have a chance to play around with Sesame which is the most advanced voice model that's out um it's shockingly like talking to a human um and so they had uh two models I played with both and I was I was really shed shocked as how far Advanced these voice models are who's behind Sesame no one in specific that I can point out to some Founders okay um but Sesame by far is Advanced like I've played around with it and like I had my wife played around with it and and she's like she's she started like shuddering like this is weird like it's like I'm talking to someone like that's human but it's not human yeah has the torn test yes um and so she was even like the way the uh it simulates breathing like it's it's it's it's very good by the way like what you mentioned about Google is is is exactly the reason why I own the only American Stock that I own right now is Google and the reason for that is Google's forward PE is like 17 it's not cheap it's not that cheap but it's reasonable yeah compared to like the other Max 7 and for the first time in like one decade one or two decades Google is actually able to compete on The Cutting Edge because before there was mo mobile and then before that there was social and Google lost both yeah well Google has YouTube but Google acquired YouTube yeah but Google lost to to Facebook with like like in the early days of Social and then lost to um uh I mean he was never able to compete on mobile with apple and and mic even Microsoft right but AI I've always felt that Google is Google has the right DNA to win AI because AI is deep software Tech yeah and Google is very good at it I would not be surprised if by the end of this year Google becomes the the best has the the best AI Sergey came back for this FYI Sergey the founder of Google came back came back to Google and he's working overtime apparently oh that's the rumors that seeing on Twitter okay apparently he's working overtime to make sure that Google wins yeah what I liked about Google was that when I do deep research on Google it gathers data from YouTube so what like people's podcasts as an example and like other types of like real-time information which I thought was an Unique Edge for me like sometimes I'm like well this research probably would be better if I did it on Google versus chat gbt or Manis an example right um and so I started using Google for that reason yeah uh and so like you could think about like certain edge cases where you think you could get better information based on the data they have accumulated yeah actually no that that's a really good point like I I probably still use a combination of like all the top five yeah AI assistants like chat GPT perplexity uh Claude uh Gemini deep seek so on so forth but like there's always one that I prefer over others depending on the situation and right now I cannot tell you exactly in what situation I prefer one over the other but it's in my head yeah like I just have an intuition okay in this moment I should be using chat TP yes yeah right yeah yeah uh like over time you just develop your own like neural network for choosing the right uh AI system that's right open AI just raised around for 30 billion or for 30 billion um at a 300 million 300 billion dollar valuation that's pretty scary it's pretty high yeah soft Bank obviously yeah of course okay so so AI is getting pretty Cutthroat as well both on the base model side of things and all the applications all the Mac 7 except for Apple I would say are developing are investing pretty deep into a apple is probably also investing a lot into AI but they haven't built anything yet yeah but last week Amazon released or launched their own uh browser use uh product oh that's right yeah they did so they're competing with chat GPT and thropic everyone else on browser use side note recent interview with Jeff Bezos apparently he's back and going all in on AI as well he's back to uh to working he he didn't say directly if he's working it he goes what's the number one thing that Amazon like he didn't the guy didn't even finish a sentence and and Jeff B is AI yeah so I think personally like everyone's back and they're they're excited and they want to win this race like sergey's back I don't know if Jeff Bezos is officially back but you could tell like he's in the weeds with AI uh and Amazon yeah and this is probably the most exciting like this is the most competitive but most exciting period of technological Evolution here yeah yeah it's pretty crazy do you want to talk a little bit about coding AI coding because this is um uh so the the the the SEO of repet yes go ahead um said last week that uh I no longer think you should learn to code it went viral the Tweet went viral viral and a lot of people were pissed I mean rightfully so but you know it is something that's going to H happen right I think people I think people uh misinterpreted his quote he said I don't think you should learn to code but he didn't say I you should not learn to code I think what he meant was uh you don't have to learn to code anymore yeah rather than you shouldn't learn to code yeah I think there's a big difference between the two yeah but uh what I'm there's a couple of anecdotal data points I'm I'm seeing right now so one within Alliance in the current batch I asked all our Founders in the all the technical Founders in the current batch how much productivity Improvement have they seen over the last three years basically since Chad GPT came out from Chad GPT to now cursor and wind Surf and the range of answers they gave me was somewhere between two to four x that is an insane C up productivity boost yeah on the coding side the second data point is uh when I talk to Founders individually the the the non-technical founders individually I see more and more of them that tell me that they start to use cursor to Vibe code their front end yeah and the reason why that's important is because often times the the the non-technical founders so when you have a team that has one technical founder and one non technical founder often the non-technical founder is the Visionary uh they know what they want to see yeah in the product yeah right y yeah without Vibe coding so in the prei era what they had to do was explain their Vision um to the technical co-founder but often times a lot of details get lost in the negotiation between the two and in the translation between the two like when a technical person and a non- technical person work the same team they often have to negotiate because some things are not doable yeah or not easily doable right so the end product often does not match what the Visionary originally envisioned but now with Vibe coding the Visionary on the team can translate what they have in their head into the actual front end yeah and that is really really powerful and of course the that piece of code will not be perfect given the the current state of vibe coding but but then the technical person can um polish the code and make it more professional right and so like this really is the era of the idea guy you're an idea person you have an idea for what the product should look like and then you can talk to AI to translate your idea into actual product at least into the actual front end the the exact front end that you want to see so that's the second data point that that I'm seeing and then the third data point I'm seeing is uh just my friends telling me how uh they use cursor for the first time and then it just complete GameChanger in terms of productivity crazy yeah so even like I'll give you my own example I'm not technical but I started uh Vibe coding quote unquote just doing basic stuff uh using Manis and uh like I could do it I mean it's it's pretty crazy um I I just deployed my own AWS server and I just started uploading the code and I was like wow like this is um you know I was I was building a telegram bot nothing crazy but um for the first time I think it opened my eyes as to like what Founders are going through right like if I could do something like this imagine what they could do is the way I saw it the implication of this is is crazy for startups yeah because at at the current pace of development in AI coding AI coding assistance sure I see a world where it'll no longer take more than half a million dollars and just a couple of guys to build a unicorn it's interesting to bring that up uh I was speaking to uh one of our Founders um who it they were originally called terase but they changed uh to poof that new and they're essentially building Vibe coding for crypto to start um and when I asked him I said who's your like first group of customers you want to go after and he said essentially Founders that want to come up with an MVP y u I'm like that's like a perfect set of customers to go after right like if you have an idea go out and just like test your hypothesis it gets you you know a quicker feedback loop in terms of uh understanding whether whether or not you want to build for that customer base or you want to quickly switch so much so I do think the rate of innovation of the types of apps that we're going to see is going to increase 10 volts um because we can get to product Market fit quicker because we could test out the hypothesis quicker the other type of customers they can go after is just consumers sure and so if you want if you want to create an app that is customized for you yeah that sits on top of some amm amm or whatever you can use their product to do that exactly for you and so um I think there's a world where there's going to be thousands if not millions of micro apps and every micro app is tailored for the enduser themselves and the reason why I I thought of this was because a couple months ago one of one of our other Founders uh he built a uh language learning app for himself uh over the weekend and it took him like two uh two hours using cursor and it was much better for him than um something like dualingo because he had all the features that he needed and nothing else it took him couple hours to do that and that was the light bul moment for me and I was like okay all these big apps are great but they're not tailored for every person and there's always one or two things that a individual user wants that those big apps don't provide and so there is a world where every person can just create an app for their own use case here's the deal I I want to give you uh do you know level siio on Twitter yeah he's like a Indie Dev Etc builds uh stuff and launches it pretty quickly and um just based on what you said he's like type of guy that will build these like unique Niche focused apps and it gets like it makes money right away um and so perfect example of of what you just said was he put a tweet out saying Skype shut down someone could build something some variant of this using Ai and they will you know instantly get customers because people still prefer using landlines to make phone calls and so someone went public with this and said like I I'll do it they did it and they're making like I don't know 10K a month or something crazy uh just yat phone I think was called and so that like example and the example that you gave is a perfect like atmosphere where anyone can launch Niche apps and make money right away and solve a problem for a small group of users across the globe right because you have the internet at scale that will you know so you'll have customers all across the world that will have similar issues and you'll get someone that can I think this is the next big opportunity is building these micro apps where you can start to make money right away yeah because before like there's smaller like non unicorn type of opportunities yeah like lying around everywhere but the best people are just too the they're they're they don't they won't bother with these smaller opportunities they go after the big ones yeah so like all these OPP no one is going after these opportunities before but now like anyone non-technical maybe not now yet but very soon within next two to three years anyone non- technical can build a product for these micro opportunities that makes like 10 10K you know yeah 50k a month I think we're in the phase of like the the micro un unicorn season yeah um where we're going to see hundreds thousands of micro unicorns are going come around that going to solve small Pro big problems for a small group of users but it'll only stay small yeah it'll never get that big and maybe then we'll see consolidation after that but that's kind of the and the other thing is these small startups are never going to IP yeah so what if they want liquidity which is a perfect reason why they should tokenize exactly yeah um yeah this is a this is a very good opportunity for that another Trend that I'm seeing I want to get your thoughts on was this guy I forgot his name but he launched cal um I downloaded the app Cal AI um essentially you could take pictures of your of the food you're eating it'll automatically calculate the calories the fat and all that and get you a regime that's like a good health regime uh regime uh for your weekly calories calorie intake yep he's 18 years old he got rejected from every University that's out there uh he put his you know he put his uh you saw that right yeah yeah and you know people started commenting on his admissions or whatever that's besides the case the Highlight the point I want to highlight is it's a 18-year-old kid that thought of an idea launched a product and started making I think $10 million in ARR um and I'm starting to see more and more people that are leaving school right College they're they're saying you know what we're not going to go to college we're just going to go out and build y um and this is it seems like I don't know if this is because of AI or people just realizing that education is important but not as important as just building something that people want and so I want to point out to I don't know if you read Nikita's tweet which I thought was preent uh but he said uh working at Google or going to Harvard doesn't actually give you status for one simple reason and missions and hiring decisions are made by small committed people and is prone to error the only people it will impress is literally the worst people on Earth institutional boot liquers like Connecticut wasps and people with PhD said pseudo science real status only comes from things that can can't be faked like creating something used by Millions winning a competitive election taking a company public saving lives next time you think you need that Google job to be someone always know that the ultimate status would be forcing Google to buy your company yeah I think there will be more and more Founders younger Founders the average founder the average suc quote unquote successful founder will be younger and younger in fact in our next batch we have a couple of kids from Princeton who just dropped out in their second from their second year yeah when we were on the call with them I was like they have no clue what they're going to build but man these guys have a lot of talent and a lot of I just felt the heat yeah and and we we talked about this a couple days ago we said like I was telling you that if I look back on the best Lance Founders over the last few years there is a surprising High proportion of them that are fresh grads in their mid 30s early uh sorry mid 20s early 20s I think that's going to continue um it's going to continue to say the course I think we're just going to get more younger younger I think we have to be more open as far as the the types of ideas right so we're seeing that as a change another change I want to talk a bit about is even on the um education side for elementary schools and younger kids we you know obviously we have some we have a team that's building the ability to read at a younger age and um to improve over time just by using AI um there's a there's a new startup school called um Alpha school have you been following them yeah that's the one in uh Texas Texas and uh the kids basically learn through an AI yes and they spend like maybe one fifth or something of two hours a day two hours a day um to learn standard academics and they outperform the other kids that go to traditional schools Texas private schools use of new AI tutor rocket student test scores to top 2% in the country yeah this has been obvious to me for at least a year or two because through my own experience I just saw how powerful AI is as as a as a tutor but my my vision my vision for for uh K12 education is that in maybe five to 10 years maybe longer but that time Horizon um standard traditional education system will be completely disrupted by Ai and the exact way it'll you'll um it'll work is in instead of sending your kids to a Traditional School eight hours a day waste a ton of time in classrooms listening to like boring teachers and then learn about things that you already know or learn about things that you're not interested in in uh you can just have an AI uh teaching your kids the same standard academics only spend like two hours a day and basically every kid will have their own private tutor and that private tutor is an AI of course and it's better than the average high school uh grade school teacher far better like this is going to happen in 10 years and I I actually can't see any other way I hate the current Traditional School model like 8 to 8 to 400 p.m. 9: to 4 p.m. it's just insanely [ __ ] and I just feel like the use of time like how much can one student take like how much information can one student take and then retain it's just not enough and I feel like the students are just more passive than they are active and with AI you could become much more active which I think is the right way to go another point I want to make here is um like here's one of the points about Alpha scho and or how it's explained it's a school where eight-year-olds launch startups 10y olds give Ted style talks and 12-year-olds tackle Harvard school Harvard Business School challenges I mean it's practical use cases right like you know you're actively using your brain to solve problems mhm whereas before like you're sitting in a class and you have a teacher that's just talking it's like 12:00 p.m and no one gives a [ __ ] and they just want to leave for lunch like you know I do think uh School needs to change and Alpha School seems to be the most exciting so far yeah anything else that that caught your um yeah doors oh yeah go ahead I saw news of Apple thinking about launching their AI doctor product and I do think apple is best position in the world oh yeah solve that problem because they have so much data they have Apple watch like all my uh uh cardio data all my blood pressure all that all that stuff right sleep data etc etc but aside from Apple I think there's still a lot of opportunities for startups to build AI doctors I actually talked to Roberto on our team he said his primary use case of chat GPT today is for health advice he tells chat GPT all all the time for to get advice on like I don't know cardio and and diet and sleep and stuff like that but I definitely see a a case for a AI doctor that is a rapper on top of these general purpose AIS but also takes data from everywhere else like from your Apple watch your um uh medication data your your doctor's appointment history like all your blood work all that stuff and it just takes all this data into account and outputs a recommendation for you I think that's going to be really powerful and the reason why I thought of this was because um I took my son to uh the allergist uh last week I I told you like that was the biggest allergy season uh in my area I take my son there and then the doctor was very experienced but like most doctors like most most good doctors I've met he was very rushed uh he didn't want to talk to me um most doctor what's that that's most doctors it's most it's most good doctors like that doctor has a lot of patients and he rushed to finish the meeting uh I couldn't ask all the questions I wanted to ask so I went back home and asked chat GPT the same questions uh and gave all the information to CH chat GPT about my son and then chat GPT gave the same diagnosis as the doctor yeah but he actually gave good recommendations he answered all the extra questions that I that I wanted to ask the doctor but but he didn't have time to to answer me and so I was just thinking hey why like why wouldn't doctors as a profession at least some categories of doctors as a profession to go extinct sure I mean tele medicine also like if you think about it is just an extension of of Iz Medical Services right yeah and I think uh I mean teleservices works for now but I think a means to the end and I think AI is going to be ultimately the the solver of that problem of personalized healthare yeah I mean I can give you numerous examples of people that I know okay so like here's a perfect example like my uncle is sick in India so like they sent me like all this like documents from what the doctor says they don't know how to read it I just uploaded CH GPT I'm like okay tell me the summary of this it gives me the exact summary I'm like okay what do you think is the conclusion how do you solve for this and it gives me exactly what the next steps are and then I tell I tell him in India and okay perfect it's not that serious I'm like no or I'll tell him it's very serious like depends yeah but the doctors themselves don't know how to explain it uh they don't tell you anything they just give you the documents and leave and so um even just Assurance as far as whether this is serious or not is like a step step level Improvement yeah for diagnosis um I don't know how many people get misdiagnosed just it's insane at the very least like AI can help you double check the work yeah that that doctors um did 100% um and so um I do think there's um I I I do think uh like I a med I don't know if there are like what types of startups are out there already that are medical focused there's probably a lot probably a bunch yeah but but nothing quite good yet yeah maybe it's maybe it's G to be apple I don't know but what's also interesting is that uh Mike on our team Mike who is our legal counsel he said that um he thinks the junior lawyers are going to go extinct as a profession oh yeah I mean lawyers generally speaking right um a lot of the work could be delegated to AI for now especially the junior ones the junior ones yeah yeah um I could see I could definitely see a hit on that industry even for us like Junior analysts like or like researchers you don't really need that anymore no so I do think breaking into these types of Industries will be harder for for for people that want to build their reputation they're going to have to find other ways to build their reputation you know one way probably is going to be just uh showcasing your intuition on Twitter and um I've seen some you know people that received jobs that way where they just tweet a lot more and they put up some really good insights and then I'm like I'm sure this person is going to get hired somewhere and then you see them getting hired but yeah it would be interesting to see where that goes the trend that I'm seeing is that AI is replacing a lot of Junior jobs across multiple Industries right like we mentioned doctors loyers but also even for our business you know remember back back back in the day we said you know we wanted to hire some analysts yeah Venture analysts but now we don't need it anymore like the for me the the the role of a junior Venture analyst is that because a lot of analysis A lot of the research you can just talk to AI yeah and interestingly uh I think what was it Kyle that tweeted that AI is oh yeah something to the effect of AI is a is a big boost for generalists versus Specialists I get his point but the counter is the most experienced people in every industry actually cannot be replaced by AI they have an an edge against AI because they have data that AI doesn't have and these most experienced people they're they're Specialists yeah it's multimodal right like I mean a generalist could be specific into one category a c a person that's specific in one category could be cross category yeah um and so I think it helps both sides is the way I see it it's not just one side yeah I I I think it what it comes down to primarily is agency like you know if you want to learn other categories if you want to be aggressive then you will um those that are that don't have agency they'll just fall behind and they'll get out competed by people that are using AI there there's a book that Naval recommended about um parenting uhhuh oh yeah you know what I'm talking about I forgot the name yeah um I just remember the two things that he put out there which I thought was very interesting I have that book I haven't yet I started reading it but but the point of the book is that uh if you want to teach your kids agency yeah you you want to do that as early as possible and you want your kids to make the decisions for themselves as early as possible most of the decisions even if the decisions don't aren't necessarily short-term good for them like eating an ice cream right um you want them to make the mistakes through their own decisions so they can really learn from these mistakes so that when they're older they know exactly why these decisions are made that way as opposed to the opposite scenario where you tell your kids hey you should do this you should do that but they will never understand at at a deeper level fundamental level why these decisions are made and this is one of the best ways to uh inject agency into your kids it was interesting because um the way he explained it was you could read um he gave two specific examples one was I let my kids eat anything they want so as long as they read for two hours and do math for two hours or like it was one hour each or something y um as so as long as they do that they can have whatever they want so if you want ice cream every hour you can then he said like as they were getting older one of the daughters or something said in the order of like I'm not going to eat ice cream because it's not healthy uh every hour and so like she came and learned that on her own right um which I thought I mean it's very I I I pitched this to my wife she goes [ __ ] no we're not doing this but what I ended up doing was um which maybe you should do too I ended up buying both of them Kindles um Amazon not the fire Kindle but just the reading Kindle and um I'm like go ahead have at it and so now um I'm like if you read if you read I'll give you some time to watch TV as an example like so like I like we don't watch TV at our house right um but you know on special occasions I let my kids watch TV you know like if they're like if we if they're home from school Etc if there's like a holiday or something or on the weekends and um and now I'm like you read and then I'll give you some time to watch TV it's like the way I did it now they're spending almost two hours a day on their Kindle reading um just naturally because they just love to read and so uh you could watch on on your if you have the parent ashb you could see how much they're reading but uh yeah they just love it and so I did take some element of that and I put it in and and it's it's working great so they're reading two hours a day now and I don't even have to like do anything about that so it's great I'm now I'm trying to get them to do like math which is a whole different problem to solve but yeah it's really cool yeah I just want my kids to spend maybe two hours a day learning the basics and the basics mean meaning math and reading yeah math and language everything else just do whatever they want yeah that's my rough plan do what like do whatever they're excited to to work on yeah I think 100% so both of my kids are very different um you know one likes to read the other likes to like more studious and the other's more like a Builder so I try to play into their DNA as far as what they like to do so my daughter's an example she loves to do like KH Academy so she'll like go on and do the curriculum for KH Academy my son likes to build so um like we I told you we just bought a an actual robot like to assemble um using nvidia's new GPU um and so um we're going to um co-build a robot together and teach him that as an example um and then I get to brush up on my robotic skills too but yeah this is kind of the way I'm thinking about it for for the future Amazon is going to make a bid to buy Tik Tok makes sense all right until next time guys all right peace peace as always the views expressed in the good game

<b>Host:</b> This content is about welcome to Good Game your no BS insights for crypto [Music] Founders we go through our ups and downs and I think in terms of attention there's a lot of exciting new releases happening on the AI side and the robotic side mhm and I think that is overshadowing what's happening on the crypto side that's exactly what's happen right now and so you know there's going to be periods of innovation that's going to capture Lots of minds and hearts and I think that's right now in Ai and Robotics whereas in crypto I think it's going through a a rebuilding process yeah looking for your next startup idea in crypto check out our request for startups list and get inspired at alliance. XYZ idas pretty much the the only uh the only narrative right now in crypto among both um Builders and investors and crypto Twitter sure even the the dents is stable coins stable coins and tokenization are the two it's the same story though like it's it's putting a yeah traditional asset on chain yeah that's become consensus now I think yeah and uh yeah I mean we're seeing uh you know a ton of Institutions that are launching their own stable coins I think Fidelity just recently announced its own stable coin um who else I mean there's a bunch of firms are coming in that are all trying to do exactly that so from an innovation perspective it it doesn't seem like there's something that's they're just Reinventing the wheels the way I'd see it yeah so I was going to put this meme up um I was trying to get chat gb2 do that like g gbly style meme uh but essentially the way the what I was trying to portray was that the competitive landscape is actually quite small and that everyone is after each other's margins um if you look at binance they started two very big uh they made two very big indirect statements the first is um I don't know if you saw the hyper liquid debacle but uh the high level of the story is you know on hyper liquid there's a token called jelly where the volume liquidity is is enough enough for someone to manipulate so someone put up a a short that was trying to essentially extract as much value it can from hlp both okx and binance added to it publicly I don't know exactly how they did it but they put up a tweet I think it was CZ that put up a tweet or something he retweeted something but essentially they wanted to see hyper liquid fail um was the end end story there and and that is because hyper liquid is a competitive threat to both binance's business and and all the other exchange businesses from a derivatives P perspective right second um I put a tweet out a couple days ago uh but pretty much talked about how binance is now listing tokens that are listed from uh for mem which is a pump swap or pump UHF fund comp uh copycat on BNB so anything that's listed on pumps uh for meme then gets listed on binance so they listed like Mubarak if you remember that uh broccoli and two other to and everybody was C's dog or C's cat yeah's dog and that pretty much and people are really really upset they're like what is this what has binance become but the explanation is pretty logical and that is you know theyy pump salana and Jupiter as the the competitor in this case yeah and we talked about this several months ago we did um but now we're seeing this in action right um and now they're they're starting their own thing and and so it's like binance is competitive with both hyper liquid and and pump and and Jupiter and Etc yep onchain versus offchain Wars is what I call it everyone everyone is going after the the same business same businesses exactly which is basically trading exactly trading on one side and then stable on the other trading trading is is a bunch of Crypton native businesses and decentralized protocols and Robin Hood of course and then stable coin side is like cirle tether against a bunch of trapi fintech so the question then becomes well I want to also touch on Robin Hood and then we could touch on the competitive landscape Robin Hood I don't know if you saw their most recent um uh they had a um I don't know like a two-hour kind of like a appal esque presentation about the future of Robin Hood they talked about a lot of things um but some of the things that stood out to me was they're in the camp of tokenization of everything yep and so they agreed to that thesis and they want to bring that to the market they have extreme distribution to do so y two is tokenization real estate and how they want to bring real estate to everyone to trade y I don't know exactly how but I would assume and we've talked about this a year ago was the concept of like a tradable openc MLS right like you go on openc and you buy and sell properties right it's similar to that right and the other thing which I could be a derivative it could be oh yeah it could be like because Robin Hood is very good at I don't think Robin Hood wants people to trade borign spot real estate no they want people to trade highly leveraged derivatives on top of um real estate it's like they really understand their Market that that's their bread and butter they understand their customers really really well yeah and uh the other thing that threw me off guard was um did you see their um cash delivery service no how does that work so I'm not sure exactly like the details of it but the high level is uh you could get cash delivered to you versus going to an ATM like physical cash physical cash okay why peerto peer I thought of this as a um kind of a new take on peer-to-peer I mean like who uses cash us this is what what my first thought was but it turns out like I mean I'm I think probably most people use cash for stuff right I mean all my contractors prefer cash yeah yeah yeah yeah um my my barber cash I mean they even stopped asking me to use zel because before I would use zel they're like just I don't want use zel anymore just give it it's privacy it's privacy yeah um and so that is the driver and and I thought that was the most interesting announcement of all the announcements I I understand the pain point I don't understand why they would do it the pain point is if I go to a bank and I want to take some cash out over $10,000 they would ask me a bunch of questions as if the money was not mine and theirs yeah and that's really painful it is p as as a customer of banks I understand that paino but I don't I don't understand why Robin Hood wants to be in this business you know it could be another well it could be that the ATM business is still very very profitable um and if you could take that business like do they want to become a bank or something is that what's happening they want people to deposit money yes uh oh they want people to deposit money so they can land it to someone else and capture the spread effectively being bank that could be the underlying reason for it which is like take your money out of your bank give it to us yeah um but I mean it's cash delivery service but like uh they are offering additional incentives um so most recently they announced a uh they made an announcement where you get I'm I'm actually thinking about this uh which is if you roll over your brokerage account will give you an additional 2% yeah as a bonus um so I I'm actually considering rolling rolling it over because it's not bad and so they're be they're push they're making an aggressive push on it seems like on all aspects whether it's traditional business uh traditional banking services whether it's traditional brokerages or now the new age of crypto exchanges they have their hands in I I would say all three vertical I think Robin Hood is the biggest threat to coinbase I think Robin Hood's a big biggest threat to crypto startups because all the services that that they're explaining like well there's tokenization of X or Y is what we want to do with our Founders right um and if they become the main distribution point then you kind of cut out the middleman in this case yeah so um and so that then like let's bring it back home like now you see the competitive landscape and it seems like the competitive landscape right now is very small it gets even smaller when uh you have Robin Hood and and others in the mix when you say small you mean there was a bunch of people going after the same high yeah hyper liquid binance coinbase pump uh pump swap is is what like 30% of the volume onch volume now or something um something pretty big pretty substantial yeah it's pretty big I'm not sure exactly what uh the most recent numbers are but um yeah so 24-hour volume is uh 294 million wow uh Revenue annualized 30 million radium amm 332 million wow um volume yeah volume has dipped now it's at 20 yeah pretty much uh pump has overtaken radium in terms of volume is the way is the way what I'm seeing yeah so all what data are you looking at Dy llama yeah same the 24-hour volume is about the same yeah they're they're on the same order of magnitude in terms of volume and revenue yeah I think what's keeping radium consistent is just the the tokens that I've already launched on there the the majors the majors um but eventually that could dip right um so so you have pump that took yeah so like you know you have um Jupiter that launched Meteora also which is its own name well I'd say they're two different companies but it's part of the same like set of companies and Founders um which is an amm you have Jupiter that's the aggregator right you have moonshot which is one of their partial Acquisitions or whatever so it seems like it the competitive landscape is going after the same marginal customer um and the question is how do you open up the pi and get more users onto the onto uh crypto I think that's the next question so yeah so from a so going back to your original Point as far as like it's kind of boring um this is what's playing out right now I think um and because of this we have to just wait and see where this goes before we see I think the next level of innovation coming out I'm seeing some experiments like um there's a startup called I don't know if you saw noise on Mega E that's uh you know people are talking a bunch about that which is essentially they're using kaido as a way to uh long short Trends so it takes like the Mind share data right think of kaido is a it's like fantasy it's like fantasy but focusing on on trends than creators exactly and they use kaido as a Oracle yeah um I mean it's fine like we we've like these ideas we've thought about them for for a long time and um these are financializing attention basically and we've we've had a thesis about this for for at least a year or two now it's just a a regurgitation of of of the thesis that's coming up right so but nothing that has really changed the landscape in my opinion outside of some of the stuff that that we we've seen launched like pump and others um because yeah yeah so that's kind of uh the way I see it uh in crypto right now anything else on the crypto side um you Circle IPO yeah Circle IPO let's talk about Circle IPO so they're they're priced at like 3 to four billion is that right yes four to five I can't remember the the exact number but it's somewhere in that order of magnitude which by the way is slightly lower than I would have expected maybe I have a bag bias I think you have a bag bias I have a bag bias but the most interesting thing about the the IPO filing is that uh they are paying 50% of their Reserve Revenue to coinbase the reserve revenue is whatever Revenue that they generate from um oh yeah um putting the the money into Treasury and other yield instruments but they're paying 50% to coinbase and that number in hindsight is not shocking but it's still pretty big right it's a big number uh their headline revenue is like 1.8 1.7 billion last year and they paid 800 million to coinbase so that's really interesting the reason why it's interesting is is that it it is fundamentally the same story as pump fun pump swap versus radium in the sense that coinbase is the main channel of distribution for usdc yes yes and therefore it has a lot of bargaining power against Circle yeah because it owns the enduser and circle when they started Circle uh or when they started usdc they understood this they understood that that they needed coinbase for distribution and the reason why it's the same story as as pump and and radium is is that pump owns the enduser and it has a lot of bargaining power against the underlying amm so what happens if uh the yield drops for treasuries it's probably uh an existential risk for Circle do you think that's why they're trying to IPO I mean they've been trying to IPO for a while now but but that's probably the the hair on fire problem for them right possibly because Trump has been Trump and um Scott Besson have been talking about lowering the the rates for a while what's also interesting is uh coinbase does not retain all of the revenue from usdc they remember like if you if you as a user deposit money into coinbase you actually earn a lot of the yield like you earn a 4% or something yeah so coinbase actually gives the majority of their revenue maybe all of it I don't know what the exact is but they give majority of the revenue back to the user yeah I think what's happening there is B is using usdc as a user acquisition tactic yeah and they're getting some of that money back from Circle exactly basically Circle pays coinbase for coinbase's user acquisition and and coinbase ultimately can make a lot more money from their other businesses yeah uh including the trading business because the trading business is a far bigger far better margin business for coinbase Ciro is fighting a it seems like a losing battle right I mean they have a regulatory mode for now but given other Trad five businesses coming in you know that can be a risk for them as well yeah I think usdc is is pretty much um is the dominant uh stable coin in the US but not anywhere else in the world everywhere else in the world is usdt yeah it's funny to mention that because um I was going through our uh stable coin chat uh with our Founders and one of the founders from I think it's from uh Colombia he said usdc is pretty is pretty cooked in La at least at the street level no one uses it it's a shame really they have much better Solutions than tether yeah the the network effect of of money is just is too big to to uh overcome yeah there's a brand like like you people are are used to usdt for 10 years and they trust the brand yeah despite all the fud you see on Twitter and and and we're talking usdt on Tron right Tron has a lot of usdt I don't know what the latest number is but the the the last one I saw was like half of it but usdt is on Tron and ethereum everywhere so what do you think the end game is here like what do you think will happen in circle just based on like we kind of gave you our audience a competitive landscape on you know like hyper liquid pump binance and maybe we didn't tell our what we think is going to happen which we should but what do you think is going to happen with circle's business I mean where they are they sit in the middle right of regulators and c and and coinbase as one you have obviously you have Founders that are adopting us you have D5 protocols that adopting USC so there has to be some lock in there where do you think this goes I don't know I think it's for Circle it from the outside it seems very difficult as a business I don't know what they're going to do yeah I don't either but it seems to me they're they're pushing for more unchain stuff actually the best thing I like about circle is cctp is the bridge yeah um it's a it's effectively a centralized Bridge yeah where um if you want to move usdc from one chain to another it's done pretty quickly I think I think they they're rolling out a new version and it's a lot quicker than before you can settle within a minute or something and it's free or virtually free yeah but uh the reason why I really like cctp is that it's it's centralized because when you when when you make a cross-chain transfer from one chain to another all they need to do is delete a number in one database in one table in their database and then create a new number in a different table in our database that's where they're able to do this pretty uh yeah pretty quickly and matter of fact as a user I trust this bridge better than the the hearttech um I I trust dbridge um and woral um I use those pretty pretty often as well um they're great yeah but yeah I mean if you were to you know compare it even on the slippage side right I think Circle has the best solution yeah so there's two m& uh deals I want to talk about just briefly which is Kraken acquiring ninja which is a uh one of the largest traditional derivative products that they're out there and the second one is derit by coinbase which is rumors I'm not sure if it went through or not but there's rumors that coinbase made an offer for derit mhm to me it just seems like um the incumbents are trying to expand to new lines of businesses because the crypto trading as your Allin one egg basket isn't enough to drive value back to stockholders or you know future stockholders for for kraken's case that's kind of the way I see it it seems like like just generally speaking on the Innovation side there's not much Innovation going on it seems like we're growing and doubling down on the additional growth and it seems like crypto is kind of moving outside of crypto to Trad businesses whereas you have Robin Hood that's in Trad that now came I mean they've adopted crypto early but then they stopped now they're coming back aggressively so it seems like both are happening at the same time yeah yeah that's how I feel all right uh sentiment check where are we in the market um we have Michael sailor that just did a two billion dollar offering for strk um that shouldn't been used anymore he does that every week yeah and so he ended up buying the last top which was around a local top which was around like 88k and now you have GameStop that just did a$ 1.6 billion do offering and to me it seems like GameStop is doing that as well yeah they just did their they finished their offering yesterday Jesus Christ look like I I I looked into you know sailor like liquid uh acquisition strategy and like it's very hard for him to get liquidated yeah I mean like Bitcoin would have to be trading less than 20K for like months on end before he could get liquidated so it's it's I yeah I see some people's concerns but after looking into it you know it seems like he's okay but it is still very worrisome right uh he's gonna be okay he's gonna be okay he owns like 3% of yeah the total Supply Bitcoin it's just very uh you know it's very aggressive he's very aggressive yeah I don't know what kind of childhood trauma he's got he would have been uh if if he was Technical and he were he was interested in anything else aside from Bitcoin any anything else in Tech outside Bitcoin I think he would have been a great founder well technically he was the founder of micro strategy I mean you're right um but yeah the the services business wasn't probably exciting for him yeah um and he needed something to get excited about and I think Bitcoin was it yeah okay anyway um back to the The Original Point like where we are in the cycle yeah um by the way on our last pod I I was like uh pretty low energy and some some people some audience noticed it I was too it was not because the market was down I was just very sick I had a cold and and we had the the biggest allergy season where I live in history it'll all boil down to what Trump is going to say today so today is The Liberation day unfortunately fortunately or unfortunately we're recording our pod on on on The Liberation day so everything that will happen in the coming weeks will depend on what Trump will say today I think there's a small number of US stocks that are reasonably valued today so I think Google is one so we can talk about all the AI stuff because Google is making a comeback in Ai and it's valuation is pretty reasonable I'm bullish on Tesla I'm bullish Tesla here um because I I bought my my cyber truck in November last year and so did you right you bought it you bought yours in like October or something I remember in November last year it wasn't quite perfect yet but within the span of like two months yeah like I don't need to take over anymore like in November last year I had to take over from the FSD yeah um once in a while and then over the last two month I can't remember last time I took I took over over the last two months yeah FSD is just it's it's it's a life changer and that's why I aped into Tesla and then there's um I think the current timeline that Elon is thinking about for rolling out uh Optimus is uh late 2026 or 2027 of course he's usually very aggressive overly aggressive with his timeline from I me Tesla is basically the most liquid Venture bet in the entire Market in the entire world it's a venture bet on on FSD and humanoids would you order the V1 of the humanoids is it out for is it available I don't think so yeah I've been looking nothing yet I think I'd agree with what what you're saying um I think Robin Hood if you were into crypto um and want to exposure to the broader Market Market is pretty good too um I'm not sure about coinbase versus Robin Hood I'd probably buy Robin Hood over coinbase just the way they're strategically positioned but things could change very quickly with that acquisition with coinbase Etc but I think Tesla is like the most exciting Venture bet in cry uh if you were to uh make a public uh asset investment um let's go to um the uh competitive landscape um of uh China us and the global markets um I've been seeing this a lot on my feed I am not sure if you have also but it seems to me that um you know historically speaking you know we have moments where countries open up or or shut shut out outside institutions so like in like if you remember in this like the 50 60s Japan started to focus more on nationalism right so like getting Sony and and others to start build innovating and building um and that led to some really great products and I feel like we're recreating that with with us right so the US is now shutting out outside import export uh and they're focusing on doubling down on on companies that are made in the US um obviously there's a lot of benefits to that but then there's a lot of pain also that comes with that and the pain is obviously like consumers consumer pricing when you get products it's going to be more expensive obviously manufacturing historically has been given to Asia even if you think about like you've read the chip Wars I've read it too now um and in in the early like periods of even chip manufacturing the US couldn't handle chip Manufacturing in terms of yield of chips so much so that the Precision of the way chips are assembled in China or southeast Asia far outweighed what the US has ever been able to do so they own chip manufacturing from the start I would say which I would say now we're paying the price because you know pretty much manufacturing as an industry is owned by China in my opinion so much so now that even like the founder of andraw Palmer lucky has said something in the order of like if China can manufacture 300 ships battleships a day us can only manufacture 10 to 12 a day which puts us out of you know pretty much a backwards Motion in terms of being able to innovate out build China like if we were to go to war with China as an example we would lose in terms of manufacturing ships not chips right ships ships okay ships is the perfect example I I would even go into like the chips and The Innovation that's happening there with China and smic we talked a bit about it last time but I'm just talking about where we are right I feel like us had the lead in terms of like Innovation and it still does but it's like a war where now China's like well you know we could do it too so they had deep seek and deep seek was the first real like existential crisis for for the US like holy [  ] we're actually being you know we actually have competition now is the way I see it yeah but there's also like uh you know the MA 7 could is not resilient anymore right like if like byd is it's a perfect example of this um byd is like the Tesla competitor in China and if you look at those cars they're pretty innovative right the Chinese cars are are really shocking because five years ago if you look at the the Chinese cars they were total garbage they look like garbage and performance-wise they were garbage yeah and within the span of one generation they managed to build better I I would argue better T better looking Tesla more performing Tesla and cheaper the I think the only thing that where Tesla is ahead today is the um autonomy is the FSD but everything else Chinese cars are are really impressive right now 100% but that's because of the power of the manufacturing they own manufacturing is aote yeah and because of that they can out innovate America like we can have the ideas but they can just copy the ideas and then add stuff on top that that's exactly what what happened over over and over again over last 20 years is that America comes up with something new be it electric vehicles yeah or solar yeah or AI yeah and then um and social actually social media came out of the US and then um China just then uh learns everything how to about how to do it how to manufacture how to write the software how to build Ai and then within a couple of generations are able to produce better products and cheaper that's right so I think what's going to happen with humanoids is the same thing the exact same thing is going to happen Tesla will build the first humanoids u in production and then China is going to copy and make it more performant and cheaper I'd say like humanoids are already out in China in the in the open from what I've seen I don't know you know this probably more than I do but I've seen videos no it's it's not imp you might be able to do like really specific tasks okay but not like general purpose humanoid yeah I haven't seen General but I've seen some out in the wild in China I don't know um so yeah we have competition is the way I see it um and um I I feel as if you know investors have choices now if they want to invest into Chinese stocks Now Chinese stocks are a lot cheaper than US Stocks yeah so I actually own a lot of uh a couple of Chinese stocks yeah U you own Baba I own Baba I told you I don't like Baba because the compan is is a little bit uh um the culture is is mediocre but I was impressed with their uh qwq mod yeah yeah that was actually pretty surprising to me the fact that they're still able to innovate but the stocks that I own are tensent and PDD I think tensent is in the same category as Baba it's big and it's it has a lot of data yeah so you can produce the best AIS probably robotics as well and then PDD is just uh PDD is is a Founder lead um it's like the Amazon uh for for China um and the culture is very good still like a startup yeah um and it's very cheap okay so so this is kind of the competitive landscape between China and us and because of that oh On a related note yeah the like on the AI side uh you you've tried Manus yeah um and I've tried Manus for asual work not like test cases like we use Manas for our work internally at Alliance and I think we both saw the same thing Manus is just way ahead of chat jpt deep research uh and like what else perplexity has deep research someone tweeted the other day that um Manis they compared Manis to Google Gemini and um if it took me five minutes to do Manis deep work it would take someone two and a half minutes to do Gemini so I started using Gemini more and Gemini is really good Gemini is good it's really good I started switching some of it's like every M every couple weeks I have to change my behavior to use the latest thing so there's no mo there's no mo and so I've been Now using um Gemini more often last night I tested out Gemini's new feature which is the uh live conversation feature where you could it's the latest update from yesterday where you could actually brainstorm with the AI live as far as what you want to work on so let's say I want to throw a birthday party or something I was able to idate with the AI I was able to uh figure out locations figure out pricing and I asked to make the phone call can you just make the call for me and and then do it for me did it didn't yet but it got me to the point where I just have to call the place and I know exactly what to do yeah but that process is very easy to dial and and automate the service right but but can Chad jpt also do this or you're saying it's not good enough it's not good enough from what I gathered um it was almost like uh I don't know if you did you did you have a chance to play around with Sesame which is the most advanced voice model that's out um it's shockingly like talking to a human um and so they had uh two models I played with both and I was I was really shed shocked as how far Advanced these voice models are who's behind Sesame no one in specific that I can point out to some Founders okay um but Sesame by far is Advanced like I've played around with it and like I had my wife played around with it and and she's like she's she started like shuddering like this is weird like it's like I'm talking to someone like that's human but it's not human yeah has the torn test yes um and so she was even like the way the uh it simulates breathing like it's it's it's it's very good by the way like what you mentioned about Google is is is exactly the reason why I own the only American Stock that I own right now is Google and the reason for that is Google's forward PE is like 17 it's not cheap it's not that cheap but it's reasonable yeah compared to like the other Max 7 and for the first time in like one decade one or two decades Google is actually able to compete on The Cutting Edge because before there was mo mobile and then before that there was social and Google lost both yeah well Google has YouTube but Google acquired YouTube yeah but Google lost to to Facebook with like like in the early days of Social and then lost to um uh I mean he was never able to compete on mobile with apple and and mic even Microsoft right but AI I've always felt that Google is Google has the right DNA to win AI because AI is deep software Tech yeah and Google is very good at it I would not be surprised if by the end of this year Google becomes the the best has the the best AI Sergey came back for this FYI Sergey the founder of Google came back came back to Google and he's working overtime apparently oh that's the rumors that seeing on Twitter okay apparently he's working overtime to make sure that Google wins yeah what I liked about Google was that when I do deep research on Google it gathers data from YouTube so what like people's podcasts as an example and like other types of like real-time information which I thought was an Unique Edge for me like sometimes I'm like well this research probably would be better if I did it on Google versus chat gbt or Manis an example right um and so I started using Google for that reason yeah uh and so like you could think about like certain edge cases where you think you could get better information based on the data they have accumulated yeah actually no that that's a really good point like I I probably still use a combination of like all the top five yeah AI assistants like chat GPT perplexity uh Claude uh Gemini deep seek so on so forth but like there's always one that I prefer over others depending on the situation and right now I cannot tell you exactly in what situation I prefer one over the other but it's in my head yeah like I just have an intuition okay in this moment I should be using chat TP yes yeah right yeah yeah uh like over time you just develop your own like neural network for choosing the right uh AI system that's right open AI just raised around for 30 billion or for 30 billion um at a 300 million 300 billion dollar valuation that's pretty scary it's pretty high yeah soft Bank obviously yeah of course okay so so AI is getting pretty Cutthroat as well both on the base model side of things and all the applications all the Mac 7 except for Apple I would say are developing are investing pretty deep into a apple is probably also investing a lot into AI but they haven't built anything yet yeah but last week Amazon released or launched their own uh browser use uh product oh that's right yeah they did so they're competing with chat GPT and thropic everyone else on browser use side note recent interview with Jeff Bezos apparently he's back and going all in on AI as well he's back to uh to working he he didn't say directly if he's working it he goes what's the number one thing that Amazon like he didn't the guy didn't even finish a sentence and and Jeff B is AI yeah so I think personally like everyone's back and they're they're excited and they want to win this race like sergey's back I don't know if Jeff Bezos is officially back but you could tell like he's in the weeds with AI uh and Amazon yeah and this is probably the most exciting like this is the most competitive but most exciting period of technological Evolution here yeah yeah it's pretty crazy do you want to talk a little bit about coding AI coding because this is um uh so the the the the SEO of repet yes go ahead um said last week that uh I no longer think you should learn to code it went viral the Tweet went viral viral and a lot of people were pissed I mean rightfully so but you know it is something that's going to H happen right I think people I think people uh misinterpreted his quote he said I don't think you should learn to code but he didn't say I you should not learn to code I think what he meant was uh you don't have to learn to code anymore yeah rather than you shouldn't learn to code yeah I think there's a big difference between the two yeah but uh what I'm there's a couple of anecdotal data points I'm I'm seeing right now so one within Alliance in the current batch I asked all our Founders in the all the technical Founders in the current batch how much productivity Improvement have they seen over the last three years basically since Chad GPT came out from Chad GPT to now cursor and wind Surf and the range of answers they gave me was somewhere between two to four x that is an insane C up productivity boost yeah on the coding side the second data point is uh when I talk to Founders individually the the the non-technical founders individually I see more and more of them that tell me that they start to use cursor to Vibe code their front end yeah and the reason why that's important is because often times the the the non-technical founders so when you have a team that has one technical founder and one non technical founder often the non-technical founder is the Visionary uh they know what they want to see yeah in the product yeah right y yeah without Vibe coding so in the prei era what they had to do was explain their Vision um to the technical co-founder but often times a lot of details get lost in the negotiation between the two and in the translation between the two like when a technical person and a non- technical person work the same team they often have to negotiate because some things are not doable yeah or not easily doable right so the end product often does not match what the Visionary originally envisioned but now with Vibe coding the Visionary on the team can translate what they have in their head into the actual front end yeah and that is really really powerful and of course the that piece of code will not be perfect given the the current state of vibe coding but but then the technical person can um polish the code and make it more professional right and so like this really is the era of the idea guy you're an idea person you have an idea for what the product should look like and then you can talk to AI to translate your idea into actual product at least into the actual front end the the exact front end that you want to see so that's the second data point that that I'm seeing and then the third data point I'm seeing is uh just my friends telling me how uh they use cursor for the first time and then it just complete GameChanger in terms of productivity crazy yeah so even like I'll give you my own example I'm not technical but I started uh Vibe coding quote unquote just doing basic stuff uh using Manis and uh like I could do it I mean it's it's pretty crazy um I I just deployed my own AWS server and I just started uploading the code and I was like wow like this is um you know I was I was building a telegram bot nothing crazy but um for the first time I think it opened my eyes as to like what Founders are going through right like if I could do something like this imagine what they could do is the way I saw it the implication of this is is crazy for startups yeah because at at the current pace of development in AI coding AI coding assistance sure I see a world where it'll no longer take more than half a million dollars and just a couple of guys to build a unicorn it's interesting to bring that up uh I was speaking to uh one of our Founders um who it they were originally called terase but they changed uh to poof that new and they're essentially building Vibe coding for crypto to start um and when I asked him I said who's your like first group of customers you want to go after and he said essentially Founders that want to come up with an MVP y u I'm like that's like a perfect set of customers to go after right like if you have an idea go out and just like test your hypothesis it gets you you know a quicker feedback loop in terms of uh understanding whether whether or not you want to build for that customer base or you want to quickly switch so much so I do think the rate of innovation of the types of apps that we're going to see is going to increase 10 volts um because we can get to product Market fit quicker because we could test out the hypothesis quicker the other type of customers they can go after is just consumers sure and so if you want if you want to create an app that is customized for you yeah that sits on top of some amm amm or whatever you can use their product to do that exactly for you and so um I think there's a world where there's going to be thousands if not millions of micro apps and every micro app is tailored for the enduser themselves and the reason why I I thought of this was because a couple months ago one of one of our other Founders uh he built a uh language learning app for himself uh over the weekend and it took him like two uh two hours using cursor and it was much better for him than um something like dualingo because he had all the features that he needed and nothing else it took him couple hours to do that and that was the light bul moment for me and I was like okay all these big apps are great but they're not tailored for every person and there's always one or two things that a individual user wants that those big apps don't provide and so there is a world where every person can just create an app for their own use case here's the deal I I want to give you uh do you know level siio on Twitter yeah he's like a Indie Dev Etc builds uh stuff and launches it pretty quickly and um just based on what you said he's like type of guy that will build these like unique Niche focused apps and it gets like it makes money right away um and so perfect example of of what you just said was he put a tweet out saying Skype shut down someone could build something some variant of this using Ai and they will you know instantly get customers because people still prefer using landlines to make phone calls and so someone went public with this and said like I I'll do it they did it and they're making like I don't know 10K a month or something crazy uh just yat phone I think was called and so that like example and the example that you gave is a perfect like atmosphere where anyone can launch Niche apps and make money right away and solve a problem for a small group of users across the globe right because you have the internet at scale that will you know so you'll have customers all across the world that will have similar issues and you'll get someone that can I think this is the next big opportunity is building these micro apps where you can start to make money right away yeah because before like there's smaller like non unicorn type of opportunities yeah like lying around everywhere but the best people are just too the they're they're they don't they won't bother with these smaller opportunities they go after the big ones yeah so like all these OPP no one is going after these opportunities before but now like anyone non-technical maybe not now yet but very soon within next two to three years anyone non- technical can build a product for these micro opportunities that makes like 10 10K you know yeah 50k a month I think we're in the phase of like the the micro un unicorn season yeah um where we're going to see hundreds thousands of micro unicorns are going come around that going to solve small Pro big problems for a small group of users but it'll only stay small yeah it'll never get that big and maybe then we'll see consolidation after that but that's kind of the and the other thing is these small startups are never going to IP yeah so what if they want liquidity which is a perfect reason why they should tokenize exactly yeah um yeah this is a this is a very good opportunity for that another Trend that I'm seeing I want to get your thoughts on was this guy I forgot his name but he launched cal um I downloaded the app Cal AI um essentially you could take pictures of your of the food you're eating it'll automatically calculate the calories the fat and all that and get you a regime that's like a good health regime uh regime uh for your weekly calories calorie intake yep he's 18 years old he got rejected from every University that's out there uh he put his you know he put his uh you saw that right yeah yeah and you know people started commenting on his admissions or whatever that's besides the case the Highlight the point I want to highlight is it's a 18-year-old kid that thought of an idea launched a product and started making I think $10 million in ARR um and I'm starting to see more and more people that are leaving school right College they're they're saying you know what we're not going to go to college we're just going to go out and build y um and this is it seems like I don't know if this is because of AI or people just realizing that education is important but not as important as just building something that people want and so I want to point out to I don't know if you read Nikita's tweet which I thought was preent uh but he said uh working at Google or going to Harvard doesn't actually give you status for one simple reason and missions and hiring decisions are made by small committed people and is prone to error the only people it will impress is literally the worst people on Earth institutional boot liquers like Connecticut wasps and people with PhD said pseudo science real status only comes from things that can can't be faked like creating something used by Millions winning a competitive election taking a company public saving lives next time you think you need that Google job to be someone always know that the ultimate status would be forcing Google to buy your company yeah I think there will be more and more Founders younger Founders the average founder the average suc quote unquote successful founder will be younger and younger in fact in our next batch we have a couple of kids from Princeton who just dropped out in their second from their second year yeah when we were on the call with them I was like they have no clue what they're going to build but man these guys have a lot of talent and a lot of I just felt the heat yeah and and we we talked about this a couple days ago we said like I was telling you that if I look back on the best Lance Founders over the last few years there is a surprising High proportion of them that are fresh grads in their mid 30s early uh sorry mid 20s early 20s I think that's going to continue um it's going to continue to say the course I think we're just going to get more younger younger I think we have to be more open as far as the the types of ideas right so we're seeing that as a change another change I want to talk a bit about is even on the um education side for elementary schools and younger kids we you know obviously we have some we have a team that's building the ability to read at a younger age and um to improve over time just by using AI um there's a there's a new startup school called um Alpha school have you been following them yeah that's the one in uh Texas Texas and uh the kids basically learn through an AI yes and they spend like maybe one fifth or something of two hours a day two hours a day um to learn standard academics and they outperform the other kids that go to traditional schools Texas private schools use of new AI tutor rocket student test scores to top 2% in the country yeah this has been obvious to me for at least a year or two because through my own experience I just saw how powerful AI is as as a as a tutor but my my vision my vision for for uh K12 education is that in maybe five to 10 years maybe longer but that time Horizon um standard traditional education system will be completely disrupted by Ai and the exact way it'll you'll um it'll work is in instead of sending your kids to a Traditional School eight hours a day waste a ton of time in classrooms listening to like boring teachers and then learn about things that you already know or learn about things that you're not interested in in uh you can just have an AI uh teaching your kids the same standard academics only spend like two hours a day and basically every kid will have their own private tutor and that private tutor is an AI of course and it's better than the average high school uh grade school teacher far better like this is going to happen in 10 years and I I actually can't see any other way I hate the current Traditional School model like 8 to 8 to 400 p.m. 9: to 4 p.m. it's just insanely [  ] and I just feel like the use of time like how much can one student take like how much information can one student take and then retain it's just not enough and I feel like the students are just more passive than they are active and with AI you could become much more active which I think is the right way to go another point I want to make here is um like here's one of the points about Alpha scho and or how it's explained it's a school where eight-year-olds launch startups 10y olds give Ted style talks and 12-year-olds tackle Harvard school Harvard Business School challenges I mean it's practical use cases right like you know you're actively using your brain to solve problems mhm whereas before like you're sitting in a class and you have a teacher that's just talking it's like 12:00 p.m and no one gives a [  ] and they just want to leave for lunch like you know I do think uh School needs to change and Alpha School seems to be the most exciting so far yeah anything else that that caught your um yeah doors oh yeah go ahead I saw news of Apple thinking about launching their AI doctor product and I do think apple is best position in the world oh yeah solve that problem because they have so much data they have Apple watch like all my uh uh cardio data all my blood pressure all that all that stuff right sleep data etc etc but aside from Apple I think there's still a lot of opportunities for startups to build AI doctors I actually talked to Roberto on our team he said his primary use case of chat GPT today is for health advice he tells chat GPT all all the time for to get advice on like I don't know cardio and and diet and sleep and stuff like that but I definitely see a a case for a AI doctor that is a rapper on top of these general purpose AIS but also takes data from everywhere else like from your Apple watch your um uh medication data your your doctor's appointment history like all your blood work all that stuff and it just takes all this data into account and outputs a recommendation for you I think that's going to be really powerful and the reason why I thought of this was because um I took my son to uh the allergist uh last week I I told you like that was the biggest allergy season uh in my area I take my son there and then the doctor was very experienced but like most doctors like most most good doctors I've met he was very rushed uh he didn't want to talk to me um most doctor what's that that's most doctors it's most it's most good doctors like that doctor has a lot of patients and he rushed to finish the meeting uh I couldn't ask all the questions I wanted to ask so I went back home and asked chat GPT the same questions uh and gave all the information to CH chat GPT about my son and then chat GPT gave the same diagnosis as the doctor yeah but he actually gave good recommendations he answered all the extra questions that I that I wanted to ask the doctor but but he didn't have time to to answer me and so I was just thinking hey why like why wouldn't doctors as a profession at least some categories of doctors as a profession to go extinct sure I mean tele medicine also like if you think about it is just an extension of of Iz Medical Services right yeah and I think uh I mean teleservices works for now but I think a means to the end and I think AI is going to be ultimately the the solver of that problem of personalized healthare yeah I mean I can give you numerous examples of people that I know okay so like here's a perfect example like my uncle is sick in India so like they sent me like all this like documents from what the doctor says they don't know how to read it I just uploaded CH GPT I'm like okay tell me the summary of this it gives me the exact summary I'm like okay what do you think is the conclusion how do you solve for this and it gives me exactly what the next steps are and then I tell I tell him in India and okay perfect it's not that serious I'm like no or I'll tell him it's very serious like depends yeah but the doctors themselves don't know how to explain it uh they don't tell you anything they just give you the documents and leave and so um even just Assurance as far as whether this is serious or not is like a step step level Improvement yeah for diagnosis um I don't know how many people get misdiagnosed just it's insane at the very least like AI can help you double check the work yeah that that doctors um did 100% um and so um I do think there's um I I I do think uh like I a med I don't know if there are like what types of startups are out there already that are medical focused there's probably a lot probably a bunch yeah but but nothing quite good yet yeah maybe it's maybe it's G to be apple I don't know but what's also interesting is that uh Mike on our team Mike who is our legal counsel he said that um he thinks the junior lawyers are going to go extinct as a profession oh yeah I mean lawyers generally speaking right um a lot of the work could be delegated to AI for now especially the junior ones the junior ones yeah yeah um I could see I could definitely see a hit on that industry even for us like Junior analysts like or like researchers you don't really need that anymore no so I do think breaking into these types of Industries will be harder for for for people that want to build their reputation they're going to have to find other ways to build their reputation you know one way probably is going to be just uh showcasing your intuition on Twitter and um I've seen some you know people that received jobs that way where they just tweet a lot more and they put up some really good insights and then I'm like I'm sure this person is going to get hired somewhere and then you see them getting hired but yeah it would be interesting to see where that goes the trend that I'm seeing is that AI is replacing a lot of Junior jobs across multiple Industries right like we mentioned doctors loyers but also even for our business you know remember back back back in the day we said you know we wanted to hire some analysts yeah Venture analysts but now we don't need it anymore like the for me the the the role of a junior Venture analyst is that because a lot of analysis A lot of the research you can just talk to AI yeah and interestingly uh I think what was it Kyle that tweeted that AI is oh yeah something to the effect of AI is a is a big boost for generalists versus Specialists I get his point but the counter is the most experienced people in every industry actually cannot be replaced by AI they have an an edge against AI because they have data that AI doesn't have and these most experienced people they're they're Specialists yeah it's multimodal right like I mean a generalist could be specific into one category a c a person that's specific in one category could be cross category yeah um and so I think it helps both sides is the way I see it it's not just one side yeah I I I think it what it comes down to primarily is agency like you know if you want to learn other categories if you want to be aggressive then you will um those that are that don't have agency they'll just fall behind and they'll get out competed by people that are using AI there there's a book that Naval recommended about um parenting uhhuh oh yeah you know what I'm talking about I forgot the name yeah um I just remember the two things that he put out there which I thought was very interesting I have that book I haven't yet I started reading it but but the point of the book is that uh if you want to teach your kids agency yeah you you want to do that as early as possible and you want your kids to make the decisions for themselves as early as possible most of the decisions even if the decisions don't aren't necessarily short-term good for them like eating an ice cream right um you want them to make the mistakes through their own decisions so they can really learn from these mistakes so that when they're older they know exactly why these decisions are made that way as opposed to the opposite scenario where you tell your kids hey you should do this you should do that but they will never understand at at a deeper level fundamental level why these decisions are made and this is one of the best ways to uh inject agency into your kids it was interesting because um the way he explained it was you could read um he gave two specific examples one was I let my kids eat anything they want so as long as they read for two hours and do math for two hours or like it was one hour each or something y um as so as long as they do that they can have whatever they want so if you want ice cream every hour you can then he said like as they were getting older one of the daughters or something said in the order of like I'm not going to eat ice cream because it's not healthy uh every hour and so like she came and learned that on her own right um which I thought I mean it's very I I I pitched this to my wife she goes [  ] no we're not doing this but what I ended up doing was um which maybe you should do too I ended up buying both of them Kindles um Amazon not the fire Kindle but just the reading Kindle and um I'm like go ahead have at it and so now um I'm like if you read if you read I'll give you some time to watch TV as an example like so like I like we don't watch TV at our house right um but you know on special occasions I let my kids watch TV you know like if they're like if we if they're home from school Etc if there's like a holiday or something or on the weekends and um and now I'm like you read and then I'll give you some time to watch TV it's like the way I did it now they're spending almost two hours a day on their Kindle reading um just naturally because they just love to read and so uh you could watch on on your if you have the parent ashb you could see how much they're reading but uh yeah they just love it and so I did take some element of that and I put it in and and it's it's working great so they're reading two hours a day now and I don't even have to like do anything about that so it's great I'm now I'm trying to get them to do like math which is a whole different problem to solve but yeah it's really cool yeah I just want my kids to spend maybe two hours a day learning the basics and the basics mean meaning math and reading yeah math and language everything else just do whatever they want yeah that's my rough plan do what like do whatever they're excited to to work on yeah I think 100% so both of my kids are very different um you know one likes to read the other likes to like more studious and the other's more like a Builder so I try to play into their DNA as far as what they like to do so my daughter's an example she loves to do like KH Academy so she'll like go on and do the curriculum for KH Academy my son likes to build so um like we I told you we just bought a an actual robot like to assemble um using nvidia's new GPU um and so um we're going to um co-build a robot together and teach him that as an example um and then I get to brush up on my robotic skills too but yeah this is kind of the way I'm thinking about it for for the future Amazon is going to make a bid to buy Tik Tok makes sense all right until next time guys all right peace peace as always the views expressed in the good game podcast are
