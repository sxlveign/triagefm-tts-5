<b>Host:</b> Welcome to <b>triage.fm</b>, your personal podcast delivery service! I'm Donna, your host to dive into your notes and read-it-laters to zero your inbox.

<b>Co-host:</b> This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>üõéÔ∏èIllusions of Intelligence.pdf</b>" by <i>Document Author</i>:
<b>Host:</b> This article from AI Secret highlights a concerning trend in AI models, and I'm surprised to see that OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini models have hallucination rates of 33% and 48%, respectively.

<b>Co-host:</b> Yes, that's staggering. And what's even more alarming is that these models were designed to reason and make decisions, but they're producing false information, which raises serious questions about their reliability.

<b>Host:</b> Exactly. It's not just about the accuracy of the information, but also the potential consequences of deploying these models in critical sectors. For example, the incident with Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, showed how AI hallucinations can lead to user backlash and business ramifications.

<b>Host:</b> Worth reading if you're interested in AI safety and the potential risks of deploying AI models without proper oversight. The article also highlights the need for further research into the causes of increased hallucination rates.


<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>–ü—É–∑—ã—Ä—å –¥–æ—Ç–∫–æ–º–æ–≤ –∏ –±—É–º AI...</b>" by <i>You</i>:
<b>Co-host:</b> So, we're seeing a similar pattern with AI stocks, like Nvidia, compared to the dot-com bubble. The price of Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed by 800%, but unlike the dot-com bubble, this growth is largely driven by fundamental factors, such as increasing profits.

<b>Host:</b> That's right. What's interesting is that the P/E ratio for Nvidia has stabilized at around 50, which is significantly lower than the 150 P/E ratio we saw during the dot-com bubble.

<b>Host:</b> So, while it's true that AI stocks are experiencing a boom, it's not quite the same as the dot-com bubble. The current growth seems more sustainable, driven by actual profits and advancements in the field.

<b>Co-host:</b> Absolutely. The article highlights that investors should be cautious, but it's not necessarily a repeat of the dot-com bubble. Worth reading if you're interested in AI and its potential impact on the market.


<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>AI & Robotics Stealing Crypto's Thunder? | EP 73</b>" by <i>Good Game Podcast</i>:
<b>Host:</b> Imran and Qiao's discussion on AI and Robotics stealing Crypto's thunder caught my attention, and I think you'll find this surprising. Did you know that Robinhood's future plans include integrating AI-powered trading tools?

<b>Co-host:</b> That's interesting. And it's not just Robinhood. The competitive landscape in crypto is becoming increasingly AI-driven, with companies like Circle and Kraken acquiring AI-powered platforms.

<b>Host:</b> Exactly. And what I found even more surprising is that Circle's IPO is expected to be one of the largest in the crypto space, with a valuation of over $4 billion. That's a significant indicator of the growing importance of AI in crypto.

<b>Co-host:</b> Worth reading if you're interested in the intersection of AI and crypto, as it highlights the potential for AI to disrupt traditional trading and investment methods.

<b>Host:</b> That covers today's content highlights!

<b>Co-host:</b> We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
