Host: Let's look at "Beyond The Dip: The Undercurrents Reshaping 2025 | annotated by vitali" by Rui:
Host: This article discusses the future of 2025 and the undercurrents reshaping the crypto market. One surprising insight is that macro policies allocate capital in the long run, but liquidity in crypto flows between casino-style trading, yield farming, and emerging value-driven investments, despite volatility.

Co-host: That's interesting. Another finding is that there are two dominant types of traders: casino gamblers and yield farmers. Casino gamblers are chasing 1000x leverage in PvP battles, while yield farmers are seeking steady, low-risk returns. This suggests that investors should focus on projects that balance yield and risk.

Host: That's a great point. Another intriguing aspect is the potential impact of Trump's proposed BTC reserve on the market. While its direct market impact may be limited, it could significantly influence corporate and international strategies, and potentially dilute the value of BTC.

Co-host: Worth reading if you're interested in the future of crypto and the potential implications of macro policies on the market. The article also highlights some interesting projects, such as Scalability, which is developing a blockchain-agnostic, base-layer connectivity framework, and YieldBasis, which is enabling real BTC-based yield through an AMM with minimized IL.

Host: That covers today's content highlights!

Co-host: Hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Until next time!
