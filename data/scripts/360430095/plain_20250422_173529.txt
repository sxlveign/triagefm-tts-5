Host: Let's look at "AI & Robotics Stealing Crypto's Thunder? | EP 73" by Good Game Podcast:
Host: Welcome back to the show, I'm here with my co-host to discuss the latest episode on AI and robotics stealing crypto's thunder.

Co-host: That's right, and one surprising fact that caught my attention is that Google is investing heavily in AI-powered education, with a focus on tailored learning for each child. For example, they're working on an AI-powered private school, Alpha School.

Host: That's fascinating. And what's even more interesting is that they're not just stopping at education. They're also using AI to replace junior doctors in the medical field, with AI doctors already being used in some hospitals.

Co-host: Yes, and it's not just Google. There's a growing trend of AI investment in startup development and innovation, with companies like Poof.new and Sesame AI leading the charge.

Host: If you're interested in the intersection of AI and education, or the future of work, this episode is definitely worth a listen.

Host: That covers today's content highlights!

Co-host: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
