<b>Co-host:</b> This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>Пузырь доткомов и бум AI...</b>" by <i>You</i>:
<b>Host:</b> This article by Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott is a must-read for anyone wondering if we're in the midst of an AI bubble similar to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.

<b>Co-host:</b> That's right! The graph comparing Cisco and Nvidia's stock prices is eye-opening. Cisco's 500% growth during the dot-com bubble was largely driven by speculation, with its P/E ratio reaching 150, while Nvidia's 800% growth is more closely tied to its actual profitability, with a stable P/E ratio of around 50.

<b>Host:</b> That's a crucial difference. And what's even more surprising is that Nvidia's P/E ratio has actually decreased since the tariff-related fluctuations, now sitting at 35. This suggests that the current AI boom might be more fundamental-driven than the dot-com bubble, with valuations still above historical averages but not at the same level of frenzy.

<b>Co-host:</b> Absolutely. So, if you're interested in AI or tech investing, this article provides a valuable perspective on the current market trends and the potential risks and opportunities. Worth reading if you want to separate hype from substance.

<b>Host:</b> That covers today's content highlights!

<b>Co-host:</b> We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
