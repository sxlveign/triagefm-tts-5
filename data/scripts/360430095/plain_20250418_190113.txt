Host: Let's look at "Все успешные стартапы похожи друг..." by You:
Host: This article by a venture capital partner reveals that there's a common thread among successful startups, and it's not what you'd expect.

Co-host: That's right! According to the author, all successful startups have a deep concern for specific people's problems, openness to the market, fast iteration, and most importantly, honesty.

Host: That's surprising! Most people would assume it's about fancy marketing or innovative products. But it's really about being truthful and authentic.

Co-host: Exactly. The author argues that most failed startups are unique in their own way, but successful ones often follow a similar pattern. And it's not just about avoiding mistakes, but about finding the truth and having the courage to face it.

Host: Worth reading if you're interested in startup stories and want to learn from the author's experience as a mentor and investor.

Host: That covers today's content highlights!
