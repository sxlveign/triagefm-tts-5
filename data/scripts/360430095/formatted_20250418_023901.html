<b>Host:</b> Let's look at "<b>Beyond The Dip: The Undercurrents Reshaping 2025 | annotated by vitali</b>" by <i>Rui</i>:
<b>Host:</b> This article predicts that by 2025, crypto markets will be shaped by macro policies and new technologies, rather than short-term volatility. What caught my attention is how the author categorizes traders into three types: Casino Gamblers, Yield Farmers, and Value-Seekers.

<b>Co-host:</b> That's right, and it's surprising that Yield Farmers are seeking steady, low-risk returns, while Casino Gamblers are willing to take huge risks for high rewards, creating a volatile market. The author argues that Yield Farmers are the most crucial group for DeFi liquidity and robustness.

<b>Host:</b> Another interesting point is that macro policies, like Trump's proposed BTC reserve, could have a limited direct market impact but significantly influence corporate and international strategies. The author also mentions the potential dilution of BTC value if it's mixed with other crypto reserves. Worth reading if you're interested in DeFi and crypto market trends.

<b>Host:</b> That covers today's content highlights!

<b>Co-host:</b> We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to onager!
