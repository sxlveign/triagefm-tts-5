### HOST: This article by a venture capital partner reveals that there's a common thread among successful startups, and it's not what you'd expect.

### COHOST: That's right! According to the author, all successful startups have a deep concern for specific people's problems, openness to the market, fast iteration, and most importantly, honesty.
