<b>Host:</b> This article explores the undercurrents reshaping 2025, highlighting the intersection of macro policies, liquidity, and emerging value-driven investments.

<b>Co-host:</b> One surprising fact is that Trump's proposed BTC reserve lacks congressional approval and could be reversed by the next administration, potentially influencing corporate and international strategies.

<b>Host:</b> Another counterintuitive finding is that crypto reserves could dilute BTC value by mixing it with other crypto reserves, weakening its position and potentially raising concerns about USD stability and driving higher rates.

<b>Co-host:</b> It's also worth noting that the article highlights the emergence of new and interesting projects, such as @doublezero's blockchain-agnostic connectivity framework and @yieldbasis's AMM for enabling real BTC-based yield.

<b>Host:</b> Overall, this article is worth reading if you're interested in crypto and DeFi, as it provides unique insights into the intersection of macro policies, liquidity, and emerging value-driven investments.
