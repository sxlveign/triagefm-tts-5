### COHOST: This is Cameron and we got some interesting content to cover today. Let's cut through bullshit and decide what's worth your full attention and what you can skip.


### HOST: Let's look at "1944: Варшавское восстание и зверства Третьего Рейха / Вторая мировая война @MINAEVLIVE" by МИНАЕВ LIVE:
### HOST: This video about World War II reveals some shocking facts about the Warsaw Uprising and the brutality of the Third Reich. Did you know that the Nazis killed over 7,000 civilians during the uprising, including women and children, and even used flamethrowers to burn people alive?

### COHOST: Yes, and what's even more surprising is that the Red Army was only a few kilometers away from Warsaw at the time, but they didn't provide any significant support to the uprising, leaving the civilians to face the Nazi brutality alone.

### HOST: That's a crucial point. The video also highlights the brutal treatment of Polish civilians, including the use of mass executions and torture. It's a sobering reminder of the atrocities committed during World War II. Worth watching if you're interested in this period of history and want to learn more about the lesser-known aspects of the war.

### HOST: That covers today's content highlights!

### COHOST: We hope this helped you decide what's worth your full attention. Stay tuned to triage.fm!
