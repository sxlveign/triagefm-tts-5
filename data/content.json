Type 2 Whales: \"Win Our Trust by Security and Time\" Yield farmers with a low-risk appetite won\u2019t chase an extra 10% APY when there\u2019s a risk of going to zero.

Over the \npast year, the sporting goods industry has persevered through \neconomic volatility, geopolitical tensions, and evolving consumer \nbehavior. Slowing growth forecasts are compelling executives to \nfocus equally on revenue growth and productivity improvements. \nOur most recent surveys, research, and analyses identified \nthemes that offer both opportunities and challenges. We \nsee a widening activity gap, with the overall share of inactive \npeople increasing while the subset of active consumers further \nembraces the active lifestyle as part of their identity. At the \nsame time, the competitive landscape is shifting, with challenger \nbrands outpacing large incumbents in revenue growth and \nmarket share. Finally, the resurgence of in-person fitness and \nthe blending of live sports and entertainment, including an \nincrease in live sporting events, offer new avenues for growth.\nAs we look to 2025, the sporting goods industry faces a shifting \nlandscape. By taking a balanced approach to granular growth \nand productivity while focusing on consumer engagement \nand emphasizing authenticity, companies can turn uncertainty \ninto opportunity and thrive in the new landscape.\nThis report aims to provide the insights and strategies \nleaders need to navigate these complexities and capitalize \non the emerging trends. We invite you to explore the \nfindings and recommendations outlined in this report.\n2\nSporting Goods 2025 Table of contents\nForeword 2\nContributors  4\nAcknowledgments  6\nAbout the research 6\nExecutive summary  7\nSporting goods at a glance 2025 10\nInterview \u2013 Jack Daly, CEO, TRX 12\nChasing elusive growth and rethinking the value chain 14\nInterview \u2013 Charles Yang, CEO, Victory Group 20\nPhysical inactivity as the biggest untapped market opportunity 22\nInterview \u2013 Rachel Acheson, SVP of enterprise strategy 28\nand futures innovation, Lululemon\nActive lifestyle as identity 30\nInterview \u2013 Nicola Rosin, CEO, Colnago 36\nMarket share upheaval with large incumbents being challenged to up their game 38\nInterview \u2013 Samuel Wenger, COO, On 44\nBoom of live sports and blurring lines with entertainment 46\nInterview \u2013 Celine Del Genes, global chief customer officer, Decathlon  52\nContacts  54\n3\nSporting Goods 2025 Gemma D\u2019Auria\nMilan\nGemma D\u2019Auria is a McKinsey senior \npartner and leader of the firm\u2019s global \nApparel, Fashion & Luxury sector. \nShe partners with clients on holistic \ntransformations to accelerate sustainable \ngrowth and create lasting change in \nperformance and health.\nEmma Zwiebler\nBonn\nEmma Zwiebler has been at WFSGI since \n2018, previously leading the federation\u2019s \nelite sport and physical activity verticals. \nEmma became interim CEO in 2023 \nand CEO in April 2024.

To gain a better understanding of \nhow sporting goods executives are approaching 2025, McKinsey partnered with the World Federation of the \nSporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) to survey 50 executives regarding their overall sentiment on the state of the \nindustry and the factors that will matter most.\nMcKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer Survey, December 2024.  We also surveyed more than 3,600 \nconsumers across Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States to explore their approach to physical \nactivity, their interaction with live sports and entertainment, and their consumption of sportswear brands. Of this \nsample, we segmented 1,842 respondents who identified as active consumers. \nAdditional research and analysis. We augmented our findings by reviewing publicly available sources (annual \nreports, company publications, and press releases). In addition, we undertook financial analysis on publicly \ntraded companies to evaluate their performance and market shares. Furthermore, we conducted executive and \nexpert interviews to gain deeper insights and validate our findings.\n6\nSporting Goods 2025 Executive summary\nThe sporting goods industry faced a difficult environment in 2024. Softer growth prospects, persistent \ninflation, and cautious consumer spending all tested companies\u2019 resilience. Despite these hurdles, the \nindustry managed to sustain a growth rate of 7 percent per annum from 2021 to 2024. The growth outlook for \n2024 to 2029 is projected at a slightly more modest 6 percent per annum, driven by a slowdown in the Asia\u2013\nPacific, Western Europe, and Latin America regions.\nThis year\u2019s report, Sporting Goods 2025\u2014The new balancing act: Turning uncertainty into opportunity , \nhighlights the dual agenda for sporting goods companies\u2014a simultaneous focus on the top and bottom lines. \nBrands are up to the task. According to a recent WFSGI survey, 44 percent of industry executives are feeling \noptimistic or rather optimistic about 2025,1 a signal of their cautious confidence in seizing opportunities amid \npervasive challenges. This report explores key themes that will shape the market and highlights consumer \ntrends that could represent paths to growth.\nChasing elusive growth and rethinking the value chain \nIn the first chapter of this report, we highlight the industry\u2019s dual focus on revenue and productivity.  \nWith cautious consumers reevaluating their discretionary spending, companies must mitigate the lasting \nimpact of inflation. \nThe industry has another challenge on the horizon: Eighty-four percent of sporting goods executives \nexpressed concern about the impact of the geopolitical environment on their business.2 Potential tariff \nincreases this year could have a significant effect on the sporting goods industry, particularly in terms of \npricing and supply chain management. Companies can prepare by accelerating efforts to derisk and diversify \ntheir supply chains. For example, they could review their supply chain footprints and inventory management \npractices as well as boost efficiency through increased automation and digitalization.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability remain priorities for sporting goods \ncompanies, but external factors and business considerations are forcing executives to make difficult trade-\noffs, leading to a decreased priority compared with last year. For 2025, half of surveyed sporting goods \nexecutives stated that sustainability is a priority for their company\u2014down from approximately two-thirds the \nprevious year.3 In addition, the chapter emphasizes the need for supply chain diversification to mitigate risks.\nIn the remaining four chapters, we drill down into further key themes that will likely feature on executive \nagendas in the year ahead.\nPhysical inactivity as the biggest untapped market\nDespite the significant benefits of physical activity, the share of adults who are inactive jumped from  \n26 percent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2022. More alarmingly, this trend could endure in the coming years, with \nthe World Health Organization projecting inactivity levels to reach 35 percent by 2030.4\nPhysical inactivity also presents an existential risk to the sporting goods industry. If levels continue to rise or \neven remain constant for younger generations, the market related to physical activity will decline. However, \nconverting physically inactive segments is the biggest potential opportunity for the sporting goods industry. The \nglobal population that is currently not meeting WHO\u2019s recommended levels of physical activity totals 1.8 billion\u2014\nan untapped market equivalent to twice the size of India\u2019s adult population. \nThe good news is that sporting goods companies have an opportunity to take targeted action to empower \nsedentary consumers to increase their physical activity levels. They could seek to remove barriers to physical \nactivity for more sedentary segments, focusing on product innovation, marketing campaigns to raise \nawareness, and enhanced youth engagement. For example, Adidas\u2019s Stay in Play product line and Nike\u2019s \n1 WFSGI Sporting Goods Industry Executive Pulse Check, December 2024.\n2 WFSGI Sporting Goods Industry Executive Pulse Check, December 2024.\n3 WFSGI Sporting Goods Industry Executive Pulse Check, December 2024.\n4  Tessa Strain et al., \u201cNational, regional, and global trends in insufficient physical activity among adults from 2000 to 2022: a pooled \nanalysis of 507 population-based surveys with 5\u00b77 million participants,\u201d Lancet Global Health , August 2024, Volume 12, Number 8.\n7\nSporting Goods 2025 modest wear line aim to address specific consumer barriers, while initiatives such as New Balance\u2019s Run \nYour Way campaign and ASICS\u2019s The Desk Break campaign raise awareness and promote physical activity. \nShimano is collaborating with school bicycle clubs to teach children how to ride a bike and raise awareness \nabout cycling.\nActive lifestyle as identity\nWhile physical inactivity has reached record levels around the world, there is also a consumer segment that \nis increasingly active. McKinsey\u2019s latest survey of these active consumers in the sporting goods industry \nrevealed an expanding gap in activity levels, with physically inactive and active cohorts drifting ever further \napart.5 For those already engaged in activity, exercise has evolved from a casual pursuit into a linchpin \nof health regimens and a defining element of personal identity. This shift stretches beyond the decade-\nlong athleisure trend, heralding a deeper transformation in which an active lifestyle has become a central \ntouchstone for a growing share of consumers.\nThis trend presents an opportunity for sporting goods brands to develop products that meet the emotional \nand functional needs of active consumers and foster long-term loyalty. Understanding the deeper motivations \nbehind consumer choices allows brands to create offerings that resonate on a personal level, enhancing \nproduct design and marketing strategies.\nMarket share reshuffle\nOver the past decade, the sporting goods market has witnessed a proliferation of new entrants, including \nboth general apparel players\u2014which have strategically expanded their portfolios to feature activewear\u2014and \nspecialized players, each offering a tightly focused value proposition for segments such as running, yoga, \ncycling, or gym attire. This specialization has enabled challenger brands to tap more deeply into the identity \nof consumers that gravitate toward brands that feel more \u201cfor me\u201d rather than \u201cfor anyone.\u201d Coupled with \ndeclining barriers to entry, this specialization has fueled the rise of challenger brands. In a telling sign of industry \nrealignment, these contenders have eclipsed large incumbents Adidas and Nike in revenue growth and hence \nmarket share gains. From 2019 to 2024, publicly traded challenger brands expanded at a faster rate than major \nincumbents; the two largest players ceded three percentage points of market share during this period.6 \nHow have newer brands managed to expand their market share so rapidly? At a high level, they have focused \non pursuing specific pockets of growth and expanding their reach in several ways: crafting a sharper value \nproposition, delivering visible innovation with platform potential, tapping into cultural marketing, and \nharnessing wholesale and selective retail.\n5  McKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer Survey, December 2024 (total n = 3,606; active consumers n = 1,842).\n6 Euromonitor International Apparel & Footwear 2025 Edition. The global population that is currently \nnot meeting WHO\u2019s recommended levels \nof physical activity totals 1.8 billion\u2014\nan untapped market equivalent to twice \nthe size of India\u2019s adult population.\n8\nSporting Goods 2025 This dynamic raises a dilemma for ambitious brands: how best to continue their growth journey and increase \nmarket share while retaining the attributes that distinguished them in the marketplace. The report explores \ntwo potential archetypes for future growth: stand-alone brands built through successful growth recipes and \nhouses of brands formed through acquisitions. To maintain their competitiveness, sporting goods executives \nwould need to objectively assess their strengths and extend their reach.  \nBoom of blended live sports and entertainment\nThe industry is observing a resurgence of in-person fitness as well as live events. This dynamic presents \nopportunities for sporting goods companies to reassess their business models, marketing strategies, and \ncustomer outreach. \nConsumers have flocked to in-person fitness options. The McKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer \nSurvey found 81 percent of respondents attended in-person fitness classes in the past year\u2014nearly two and \na half times as many as those who used online fitness classes. Consumers choose in-person fitness classes \nto boost their motivation and consistency, to benefit from the group energy, and to increase their sense of \ncommunity or belonging and meet new people.\nAfter the isolation experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the past couple of years have seen a \npersistent surge in attendance for live events. McKinsey estimates the global live events ticketing market \nsurpassed $100 billion in 2023 and could reach $150 billion by 2030. This thirst for live experiences has led \nto more venues blending sports, entertainment, and retail; new sports formats featuring competition and \nspectacle; and more sports-based content. \nAs consumers increasingly seek community-oriented fitness experiences with an entertainment angle, \nbrands that can effectively combine in-person and digital offerings will be well-positioned to thrive. In addition, \nbrands could capitalize on the intersection of sports and entertainment by partnering with other players or \nproducing their own live events, creating unique opportunities for brand engagement and loyalty. \nThe past year has marked a period of recalibration for the sporting goods industry, with uneven recoveries and \npersistent challenges. Looking ahead, we believe the most successful brands will innovate to address shifting \nconsumer demands, manage supply chain complexity, and streamline operations. Through efforts in these areas \nand a sharp focus on execution, the industry will be well placed to continue on its positive trajectory.\n9\nSporting Goods 2025 Sporting goods at a glance 2025\n1. Chase for elusive growth and rethinking of value chain \n2. Physical inactivity as the biggest untapped market opportunityThe Sporting Goods 2025 report reviews the industry\u2019s \nlatest developments and explores how different consumer \nattitudes toward sport are affecting the industry. This \nyear, we are continuing to emphasize the alarming levels \nof physical inactivity globally\u2014a problem that private \nand public stakeholders should strive to address. \nPhysical inactivity represents an \nuntapped market opportunity of 1.8 \nbillion people\u2014double the size of \nIndia\u2019s adult population\u2014the single \nlargest growth potential.Only\n3 in 10  \nsporting goods \ncompanies were able \nto deliver revenue \ngrowth and margin \nexpansion since 2018.Sporting goods players are \nadopting a dual agenda to work \non their top and bottom lines \nas they face a softer market \ngrowth outlook and geopolitical \nuncertainty.\n31% \nof adults globally are \nconsidered inactive, five \npercentage points higher \nthan in 2010 and expected \nto increase to 35% by 2030.\n10\nSporting Goods 2025 3. Active lifestyle as identity\n4. Market share upheaval with large incumbents being challenged to up their game\n5. Boom of live sports and blurring lines with entertainmentAs physical activity is shifting \nfrom casual interest to a top \npriority for health and identity \nfor consumers who are already \nactive, sporting goods players \nneed to sharpen their value \nproposition and connect with \nthese consumers at an emotional \nlevel to be their brand of choice.\nThe battle for market share \nwill likely intensify in 2025 as \nmore challenger brands win \nby targeting specific growth \npockets and expanding reach. \nExecutives may need to rethink \ntheir approach to growth.\nConsumers\u2019 hunger for live \nexperiences increasingly blurs \nboundaries between sports, \nretail, and entertainment, \ncreating an opportunity for \nsporting goods players to boost \nloyalty and engagement and \nreach new consumers.$150 billion  \nlive-ticketing market size \nvalue is expected by  \n2030, up by $50 billion \ncompared with 2023.3% \nof market share has \nbeen lost by large \nincumbents and captured \nby challenger brands \nbetween 2019 and 2024.1 in 2  \nactive consumers \nreported that fitness  \nis a core element of  \ntheir identity.\n11\nSporting Goods 2025 A few years ago, people had disposable \nincome. Right now, they seem stressed, \nso they\u2019ve tightened their belts. Our \nhigh value, low-cost products allow us \nto thrive in a cost-conscious market by \nenabling consumers to fit an entire gym \nin a bag with a TRX Suspension Trainer \nto do strength, cardio, mobility, yoga, \nand Pilates.\nAs a result, companies are creating \npartnerships versus launching new \nproducts. They\u2019re also making smart, \nfiscally conservative moves such as \nactivating their brands. For example, \nwith the TRX Training Summit, we \ngathered approximately a thousand \npeople in Athens, Greece, for a two-day Being prepared for an \nuncertain world \nHow tough was it for the industry to \ngrow in 2024? How has TRX thrived \nduring market challenges? \nFrom an industry perspective, growth \nwas challenging in 2024 because of a \nconfluence of different trends. We\u2019re \ndealing with a post-COVID-19 hangover \nin which some consumers still work out \nat home while others have returned \nto the gym. This has caused capital to \nfluctuate and then pause as the industry \ntries to find its footing. Businesses are \nhunkering down because we don\u2019t know \nwhere the growth pockets will be. So the \n2024 market was flat for the most part. \nAlso, in a macroeconomic sense, the \nconsumer hasn\u2019t been terribly healthy. \n\u2018  A few years ago, people  \nhad disposable income. Right \nnow, they seem stressed, so \nthey\u2019ve tightened their belts.\u2019Jack Daly, CEO, TRX\nJack Daly  is the owner and CEO of TRX, a leader in functional training equipment. In \n2022, he partnered with TRX founder Randy Hetrick to reacquire the company and \nhas since revitalized its brand. Prior to acquiring TRX, Jack was a partner at Goldman \nSachs and then at TPG Capital, leading large private equity buyouts in the industrials \nand services sector.workout event. Those are important \ntypes of activations for us because they \ndrive excitement for the brand. \nWe\u2019ve been fortunate to launch new \nproducts by leveraging strategic \ninnovation. For example, in 2023, we \nacquired YBell, which makes a piece of \nfitness equipment that is a kettlebell, \ndumbbell, medicine ball, and push-up \nstand all in one accessory. We found \na product that fits our ecosystem and \nbrought it to the market. We\u2019re able to do \nthis on the commercial side as well. For \nexample, Orange Theory is launching \nYBell right now in its gyms. So we are \nfinding growth not only through brand \nactivations but also through innovative \nproducts. \nThe share of consumers who say that \na fitness, wellness, or sports routine is \npart of their identity is growing every \nsingle year. What are you noticing \nabout how consumers are associating \nwith your brand? \nI believe that health and wellness will \nbecome more important to people over \nthe next five to ten years. There are \n12\nSporting Goods 2025 \u2018 Health, wellness, and fitness \nhave become deeply ingrained \nin the culture\u2014not only in  \nthe US, but also across Europe \nand Asia, and it is emerging \nin the Middle East as well.\u2019three components propelling this trend. \nOne is the general public deciding that \nhealth and wellness is important to \nthem; the second is the general public \nbecoming more fit; and the third is \nthat people are learning more about \nhealthy living through social media and \npodcasts. While I\u2019m more focused on \nNorth America, I see this shift happening \nglobally. Health, wellness, and fitness \nhave become much more part of the \nculture not only in the US but also in \nEurope and Asia, while emerging in the \nMiddle East. Young people are choosing \nto go to the gym and work out instead \nof going to a bar. And while the interest \nfrom younger people is growing quickly, \nso is the interest and participation from \naging people. There\u2019s a 59-year-old \nCanadian woman, for example, who just \nposted the women\u2019s record for push-\nups. So aging people are expecting to be \nable to stay fit and active, too.\nFunctional strength training has become \nmore important to offset the muscle loss \nassociated with increasingly popular \nGLP-1 treatments, which is a significant \ntailwind for TRX. People also want more \nthan just fitness. They\u2019re doing hot and \ncold training, breath training, meditation, \nand nutrition services. There are gyms \nthat cater a full suite of services for \nhealthy living. We\u2019re seeing these trends \nbecoming part of our global culture. \nToday\u2019s consumers are looking for \nsomething far beyond exercise\u2014they \nwant a lifestyle.  \nWhat exciting things have customers \nand trainers done with your brand in \nthe past year? And how does social \nmedia play a role? \nLet me start with social media, because \nit plays a crucial role in the relationship \nbetween the brand and the consumer \nright now. Through our millions of \nfollowers on our social media platforms, \nwe encourage people to tag each other \nand talk about not only what they\u2019re \ndoing with TRX gear but also innovative \nideas for healthy living. For example, \nPilates is a hot topic. Customers will \npost a side-by-side comparison of \nthemselves using a suspension trainer \nto do their Pilates versus using a $4,000 \npiece of equipment such as a reformer. Our more than 300,000 certified \ntrainers from around the world will \nalso experiment with equipment and \nworkouts and share their stories, which \nwe\u2019ll repost. Our customers and trainers \nwill activate our products and services in \na cool, fun way, and then tell everybody \nabout them.\nWe\u2019re in a very different world right now, \nbut that\u2019s not necessarily specific to TRX. \nThe entire industry is being shaped by \nthese trends. Health and wellness has \nbecome a space where you can adopt \nwhatever works for you. The amount of \ninformation out there, the accessibility, \nand the way people share their lifestyle\u2014\nthey\u2019re all making people say, \u201cI didn\u2019t \neven know you could do that.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s top of mind when it comes  \nto supply chain management for you \nand your team?\nWe focus on achieving world-class \nperformance on top KPIs such as \non-time delivery. Our supply chain was \ntroubled when we acquired TRX in \n2022. Top of mind for our supply chain \nwas fixing what we had and rebuilding \nit, so we gathered great talent from top \nbrands for their global warehousing and \nsupply chain experience. We moved our \ninventory into world-class facilities with \nthe right systems and controls in place. \nWe\u2019ve gone from a mom-and-pop supply \nchain to one that is robust with enviable \nmetrics by any measure. It\u2019s become a \ncompetitive weapon for us because it \ndelivers our products on time. \nWe also looked at where we are sourcing \nour goods from. There are big-picture and global security issues to consider, \nwhich, over the next couple years, \nmight affect tariffs, ocean rates, or \nplanning routes. When encountering \nlocal geopolitical headwinds, you need \nto think strategically about the way you \nwork with ports and, for example, lock \nup capacity by going into other ports \nbefore any problems start. That way, \nif you have to pivot, you\u2019re prepared. \nHowever, in that kind of situation, many \ncompanies have taken the products that \nare available but then suffer from delays \nand incomplete shipments. If you\u2019re \ndoing things the right way, when that \nport shuts down, you\u2019re already diverted \nto another port, or you\u2019ve already bulked \nup on inventory. That\u2019s what I mean about \nbeing prepared, because the supply \nchain is, at its core, an uncertain world.\nComments and opinions expressed by \ninterviewees are their own and do not \nrepresent or reflect the opinions, policies,  \nor positions of McKinsey & Company or  \nhave its endorsement.\n13\nSporting Goods 2025 Chasing elusive \ngrowth and rethinking \nthe value chain\n14\nSporting Goods 2025 15 Sporting Goods 2025In 2024, sporting goods executives had the \nunenviable task of adapting business strategy to \nbalance often conflicting trends. Softening growth, \nincreasingly discerning consumers, geopolitical \ntensions, and sustainability commitments all shaped \nthe landscape. Despite these challenges, some \ncompanies charted a hard-won path to growth.\n1.  Softer growth outlook:  The sporting goods industry saw an annual growth rate of 7 percent \nfrom 2021 to 2024, down from 8 percent prepandemic. Projected growth is expected to soften \nfurther to 6 percent annually from 2024 to 2029, driven by slower growth in key regions. Overall, \nconsumer behavior has shifted toward more cautious spending, with a preference for value \nproducts and essential purchases.\n2.  Dual challenges on the top and bottom lines:  In response to economic challenges and \nconsumer caution observed in 2024, executives plan to balance efforts between revenue \ngrowth and productivity improvements in 2025.\n3.  Geopolitical uncertainty and potential tariff increases: Heightened geopolitical uncertainties \nand potential tariff increases pose significant risks for 2025, necessitating strategic adaptations \nin supply chain management.\n4.  Slowed sustainability progress:  Slowing progress on sustainability commitments highlights \nthe need for renewed focus on sustainable product design, sourcing, and manufacturing \npractices.\n1.  Adapt to cautious consumer behavior: Address cautious consumer spending by offering \nvalue-driven products and maintaining flexibility in pricing and retail strategies to retain \nconsumer loyalty and capture discretionary spending in key categories.\n2.  Balance revenue and productivity: Focus equally on growing revenues and improving \nproductivity to navigate the softer growth outlook, leveraging strategies that enhance both top- \nand bottom-line performance.\n3.  Mitigate geopolitical risks: Accelerate efforts to derisk and diversify supply chains in response \nto geopolitical uncertainties, including potential tariff increases. This involves exploring \nalternative sourcing regions, investing in local manufacturing capabilities, and building strategic \npartnerships to ensure supply chain resilience.\n4.  Implement high-impact carbon reduction measures:  Focus on high-impact, cost-effective \nsustainability measures to reduce carbon intensity using the abatement cost curve logic.Key insights\nExecutive priorities Exhibit 1 Softer growth outlook and \ndual challenges on the \ntop and bottom lines\nOver the past year, sporting goods \nplayers responded to slower growth by \nfollowing a dual agenda of improving  \nboth the top and bottom lines.

Our analysis found leaders\u2014\nthose able to excel in both revenue and \nproductivity\u2014were the exception. In \nfact, since 2018, just three in ten publicly \ntraded sporting goods companies \noutpaced the market on revenue growth while increasing margins (Exhibit 2). At \nthe other end of the scale, one in three \ncompanies trailed the market on growth \nand experienced shrinking margins. \nLooking ahead to the rest of 2025,  \n50 percent of sporting goods executives \nplan to focus on raising revenues and \nimproving productivity simultaneously.3  \nAbout one-quarter of respondents said \nthey would emphasize the top line, while \nthe remaining one-quarter reported \nthat they are prioritizing improved \nproductivity.4   \nWeb <2025>\n<MCK241115 Sporting Goods Report 2025>\nExhibit <1> of <11>\nGlobal sportswear market, retail sales price value, $ billion\nNote: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.

In \naddition, consumer spending may be  \naffected even further, especially in discre-  \ntionary categories such as sporting goods. \nCompanies can prepare by accelerating \nefforts to derisk and diversify their \nsupply chains.

It took us four \nto five years to build up our operations \nin Vietnam. When we enter a new \ncountry, we need to get to know the \nlocal infrastructure, local labor laws, and \nregulations or environmental protections. \nWe also have to prebuild our capacities \nbefore we can work with major Innovation in manufacturing\nWhat surprised you most about 2024, \nand what were the biggest challenges \nVictory Group faced?  \nWe manufacture shoes for multiple \nbrands, and some of the brands that had \na big downturn in 2023 surged in demand \nin 2024. We ended up reopening a facility \nwe closed in 2023 and rehiring its workers \nso we could rush to meet demand. \nNow we can see the competition \nintensifying among the brands we \nserve. New sporting goods brands that \noffer more-innovative products with \ncompetitive pricing are coming to the \nmarket. So existing brands are trying to \ndefend their turf. \nA lot of big brands moved to where they \nmanufacture their products. We saw a \nsurge of companies going into Indonesia \nand India. So the challenge down the \nroad may be that there will be a huge \noverbuild in capacity if competition \namong sporting goods brands Charles Yang, CEO, Victory Group \nbrands and receive more orders. The \nconventional wisdom was to build \ncapacities once we saw the orders \ncoming in, but because the competition \namong brands and among manufacturers \nis intensifying, whoever builds capacity \nfirst will get the orders. \nA lot of sporting goods brands \nhave overbuilt in Vietnam; 60 or 70 \npercent of their total orders placed \nare manufactured in Vietnam. And \nmany other industries are moving \ntheir manufacturing there because of \nVietnam\u2019s duty-free status with European \ncountries. This also means they\u2019re \ncompeting for the same labor pool, so \nlabor costs are driven higher. A lot of \nbrands are now trying to diversify that \nrisk by sending their manufacturers to \nIndia or Indonesia.\nHow are Victory Group and other \nsporting goods manufacturers \npreparing to navigate supply chain \nchallenges in 2025?\nWe are focused on enhancing \nproductivity and quality. We are also \ndiversifying into Indonesia to alleviate the \nrisk of being too concentrated in Vietnam. \nLike a lot of manufacturers, we are \nfocusing on automation and digitalization \nCharles Yang  is CEO of Victory Group, \na shoe manufacturer that develops \nproducts for several major brands, \nincluding Under Armour, Speedo, \nCrocs, and Skechers. Yang has \nendeavored to help Victory Group push \ninnovations that help make its supply \nchain more resilient and circular.  \u2018 We are focusing on automation \nand digitalization to augment \ndirect workers\u2019 skills.\u2019\n20\nSporting Goods 2025 to augment direct workers\u2019 skills and \nhelp with the labor shortage as well as \nmake sure that all the information across \nthe supply chain is clearly documented \nand can be transferred to our customers \nand suppliers to avoid communication \ndisruptions. Lean manufacturing \nhas been key in the manufacturing \nindustry, so we\u2019ll be focusing on that as \nwell, especially when we are adopting \nautomation solutions. \nMany companies have made ESG and \nsustainability commitments. What is \nrequired from sportswear companies  \nto increase recycling and reduce  \ncarbon intensity? \nIt takes a lot of cooperation across the \nentire supply chain, from the brand to the \nmanufacturer to the tier-two and tier-three \nsuppliers. The manufacturing industry is \nquite fragmented. For example, you might \nhave a footwear factory serving different \nbrands and a material supplier supplying \ndifferent brands and factories. Tracking \nthe footprint of a product is complex, and \nmanufacturers will have to figure out which \ndata they can use and how to create a \ncommon platform among their suppliers. \nThey will also have to figure out how \nto properly recycle their products. For \nfootwear, for example, you have the \nupper part of the shoe and the sole, \nwhich are glued together. Now we\u2019ll have \nto figure out how to take them apart  \nand de-manufacture things to recycle \nthem properly.\nApparel is easier to recycle and resell \nthan footwear. You can\u2019t resell footwear \nin the same way, especially after it\u2019s \nbeen worn for several years. A large \npart of circularity in footwear is in the disassembly process to separate the \nparts of a shoe, which will be the biggest \nchallenge because it will require big \ninvestments.\nWhat ESG priorities are you seeing \nbrands demand?\nMost of the demands are centered on \ntracking the data as well as making sure \nthat the materials are recycled or can \nbe recycled. There\u2019s an initiative called \nMade to be Remade that is trying to \nimprove recyclability, which requires us to \nregister all the information needed about \na product to trace it. More brands are \nencouraging us to use recycled or green \nmaterials, even though they may have to \npay more. So on our end, we\u2019re focusing \nmostly on the information tracking aspect \nof this to source materials.  \nHow can brands progress toward \nbecoming net zero while still \naddressing other priorities in their \nbusiness? \nBuilding a common platform on \nwhich brands can share data and \nbest practices among manufacturers \nor brands is important. The cost of \nmaintaining ESG compliance is very \nhigh, so if there is some sort of central \nhub of information that manufacturers \nand brands can use to learn from, then \nbrands can work together to achieve \ntheir goals more easily. \nHow can the footwear manufacturing \nindustry drive innovation across the \nvalue chain? \nIf we can learn from other industries, \nsuch as the auto parts industry, to see \nhow they manage their supply chains \nand handle, say, used tires and other recyclable materials, we can apply those \ntechniques to our innovations. \nWe are also looking at other innovations, \nsuch as 3D printing, to use in \nmanufacturing. For example, we could \nblend recycled materials into 3D printing \ncompounds and make that a means of \nbuilding products.\nAnother part of the innovation may come \nfrom materials as we try to get away \nfrom using petrol-based materials. For \nexample, color selections often become \nlimited when you use recycled materials, \nwhich limits the function of the product, \nso we can find ways to make recycled \nproducts beautiful and eye-catching.\n\u2018 We are focusing on automation  \nand digitalization to augment \ndirect workers\u2019 skills.\u2019Comments and opinions expressed by \ninterviewees are their own and do not \nrepresent or reflect the opinions, policies,  \nor positions of McKinsey & Company or  \nhave its endorsement.\n21\nSporting Goods 2025 Physical inactivity as  \nthe biggest untapped  \nmarket opportunity\n22\nSporting Goods 2025 Physical inactivity as  \nthe biggest untapped  \nmarket opportunityDespite the significant and proven benefits of \nactivity, physical inactivity has reached record \nlevels around the world, with 31 percent of adults \nnot meeting recommended activity levels.20 More \nalarming, this trend appears set to persist and even \naccelerate in the coming years. The good news is \nthat sporting goods brands have an opportunity \nto take targeted action to empower sedentary \nconsumers to increase their physical activity levels. \n1.  Rising inactivity levels:  31 percent of adults globally are considered inactive, and the share \nis projected to increase to 35 percent by 2030, posing significant health, economic, and \nsustainability risks.\n2.  Untapped market potential: With 1.8 billion adults\u2014twice the size of India\u2019s adult population\u2014\nnot meeting the World Health Organization\u2019s activity recommendations, physical inactivity \npresents a massive opportunity for the sporting goods industry.\n3.  Significant intersectoral collaboration needed: While the sporting goods industry\u2014with \nits knowledge, resources, and access to consumers\u2014is well positioned to transform global \nphysical activity, the challenge is far broader and calls for governments, educational institutions, \nemployers, and healthcare professionals to further step up and collaborate.\n1.  Innovate to remove barriers: Develop products that address specific consumer barriers to \nphysical activity, such as Adidas\u2019s Stay in Play line and Nike\u2019s modest wear.\n2.  Campaign and market to raise awareness: Use marketing campaigns to promote inclusivity \nand the benefits of physical activity, similar to New Balance\u2019s Run Your Way and ASICS\u2019s  \nDesk Break.\n3.  Enhance youth engagement: Support youth and broader community engagement through \ncoaching programs, sports camps and trainings, and accessible equipment to foster a more \nactive lifestyle. Examples include Pentland\u2019s Speedo Swim United initiative and Shimano\u2019s \nschool bicycle program.Key insights\nExecutive priorities\n20  \u201cPhysical activity,\u201d World Health Organization, June 26, 2024.\n23\nSporting Goods 2025 The wide-ranging benefits \nof physical activity\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) \ndefines physical activity as any bodily \nmovement produced by skeletal muscles \nthat requires energy expenditure\u2014such \nas walking, dancing, cycling, and playing \nsports. To maintain good health, WHO \nrecommends a minimum of 60 minutes \nof moderate to vigorous physical activity \na day for children and youth and at least \n150 minutes of moderate-intensity \nphysical activity a week for adults.21\nEngaging in physical activity on a con-  \nsistent basis has benefits in several areas: \nOverall health and quality of life. Regular \nphysical activity can avert preventable \ndiseases such as heart disease, stroke, \ncancer, and type 2 diabetes\u2014all of which \ncan cause premature death. It also helps \npeople manage chronic conditions, \nimproving quality of life as well as \nreducing the risk of being overweight or \nobese. In addition, physical activity can \nhelp people lower their levels of anxiety, \ndepression, and stress. \nWorkforce and productivity. Healthier \nworkers are more productive, generate \nmore income taxes, and need less \nlong-term sick leave. The OECD found \nthat companies with workplace health programs tackling sedentary behavior \ncan achieve a fourfold return on their \ninvestment.22\nSustainability. Shifting transportation \nand mobility toward more physical \nactivity, including walking and cycling, \ncan provide a dual benefit: improving \ncommunity health while reducing \nenvironmental impact through lower \ncarbon emissions and better air quality.  \nRising levels of physical \ninactivity around the globe\nDespite these benefits, physical inactivity \ncontinues to rise, and it cannot be \nexplained as a temporary setback or \nspike in inactivity associated with the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Global physical \ninactivity in adults jumped from 26 \npercent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2022 \n(Exhibit 5).23 WHO projects that inactivity \nlevels could reach 35 percent by 2030.24\nIn addition, 81 percent of youth \n(adolescents aged 11 to 17 years) do \nnot engage in enough regular physical \nactivity to maintain good health\u2014a \npotential warning sign of higher levels of \ninactivity in the future. The youth of  \ntoday will be the parents of tomorrow,  \nand their sedentary lifestyles could serve \nas a poor example for their children.  \n21  \u201cPhysical activity,\u201d WHO, June 26, 2024.\n22 Promoting health and well-being at work: Policy and practices , OECD Health Policy Studies, November 22, 2022.\n23  Tessa Strain et al., \u201cNational, regional, and global trends in insufficient physical activity among adults from 2000 to 2022: A pooled analysis of 507 population-based \nsurveys with 5\u00b77 million participants,\u201d Lancet Global Health , August 2024, Volume 12, Number 8. \n24  Tessa Strain et al., \u201cNational, regional, and global trends in insufficient physical activity among adults from 2000 to 2022: A pooled analysis of 507 population-based \nsurveys with 5\u00b77 million participants,\u201d  Lancet Global Health , August 2024, Volume 12, Number 8.

If the younger generation does \nnot become more active, the market \nrelated to physical activity will decline. At \nthe same time, people who are physically \ninactive represent the biggest untapped \nmarket for the sporting goods industry. \nThe global population that is currently \nnot meeting WHO\u2019s recommended \nlevels of physical activity totals 1.8 billion \npeople\u2014an untapped market opportunity \nequivalent to twice the size of India\u2019s \nadult population.26  \nPhysical inactivity among adults varies by \ncountry and is influenced by socioeconomic \nfactors, lifestyle, and policy initiatives:Gender. Since women (34 percent \ninactive) are less active compared with \nmen (29 percent inactive), increasing \nwomen\u2019s activity levels could have a \nmultiplier effect. Consider that women \nare expected to control 75 percent of \npurchasing decisions by 2028, especially \nwhen it comes to discretionary spending \nsuch as sporting goods.27 They often \npurchase not only for themselves but \nalso for their children, partners, or elderly \nfamily members.\nGeography.

At the same time, \n81 percent of young people (aged 11 \nto 17 years) do not engage in enough \nregular physical activity to maintain good \nhealth\u2014a potential warning sign of higher \nlevels of inactivity in the future.  \nHow brands can help reverse \nthe trajectory\nSporting goods companies could unlock \na substantial opportunity by removing \nbarriers to physical activity for more \nsedentary consumers. Three approaches \nhold promise, and some brands have \nalready gotten started.\n1. Innovate to remove barriers: Gear the \nproduct innovation engine to address \nspecific consumer barriers  \nBrands have an opportunity to mobilize \nconsumer segments that may have been \noverlooked or underserved in the past. \nOne strategy is to develop products \nthat directly address the needs of specific segments. Adidas, for example, \ndeveloped the Stay in Play product line \nto help women stay active. Products \ninclude period-proof tights, maternity \nbras, and trainers tailored to female foot \ncharacteristics. Similarly, Nike launched \na line of modest clothing designs, \nincluding a swim hijab, to enable women \nto participate in sports activities while \nrespecting cultural and religious customs.\n2. Raise awareness: Employ marketing \nand campaigns to change perceptions \nand attract consumers to activity  \nDirectly targeting consumer segments \nthat may be hesitant to become more \nactive has proved effective. New Balance, \nfor example, launched a cross-platform \nmarketing campaign, Run Your Way, that \npositions running as an inclusive sport \nwhile raising consumers\u2019 awareness \nof, and conversion to, the New Balance \nbrand. For example, followers of  \n@newbalancerunning on Instagram  \ngrew 34 percent in 2024.29 ASICS\u2019s  \nDesk Break campaign encourages \npeople to step away from their desks and \nmove to support their mental health. It \nhas garnered more than 50 million views, \nreaching in excess of two billion people \nthrough media channels and leading \nthousands of workers around the world \nto take a #DeskBreak on World Mental \nHealth Day.30  3. Enhance youth engagement: \nImprove access through coaching \nsupport and community activation \nIncreasing youth participation is critical \nto improving physical activity levels. \nSeveral sporting goods companies have \nemployed their knowledge and resources \nto improve accessibility. \nAdidas runs the Breaking Barriers \nAcademy, a free, online gender-equity \ntraining program for coaches and \nphysical education teachers. The \nacademy aims to increase the chances \nthat youth will have early positive \nexperiences, which can translate into \nongoing physical activity. To date, 1,500 \nusers have engaged with the academy, \nand the numbers continue to rise.31  \nNike has teamed up with Dove, the \npersonal-care brand owned by Unilever, \nto give coaches tools to build confidence \nin girls, addressing one of the main \nreason girls drop out of sports at a rate \nsix times that of boys. Body Confident \nSport is a first-of-its-kind, evidence-\nbased set of coaching tools that use \nsports to help build body confidence in \ngirls ages 11 to 17. It is currently available \nin seven languages. Since its digital \nplatform launched about 12 months ago, \n115,000 coaches have used it, with more \nthan 12,000 coaches trained digitally or \nin person.32 \n28  Global levels of physical inactivity in adults: Off track for 2030 , WHO, 2024.\n29 New Balance via WFSGI, January 2025.\n30  ASICS via WFSGI, January 2025.\n31 Adidas via WFSGI, January 2025.\n32 Dove and Nike via WFSGI, January 2025.

The \nschool-based program had 742 students \nparticipate in three weeks, and 36 percent \nof children who couldn\u2019t swim before the \nprogram were able to swim 25 meters \nupon completion.33 \nShimano is collaborating with school \nbicycle clubs to teach children how to \nride bikes, raise awareness about cycling, \nand spread this awareness to extended \nfamilies through the children. The \ncompany provides bicycles for training \nsessions, spare parts, tools for repair \nand maintenance, and helmets. The \nPedalanka Bicycle School collaboration \nin Izmir, Turkey, trained more than 3,200 \npeople over the past three years.34 \nThe sporting goods industry is well \npositioned to play its part in transforming \nglobal physical activity. It has in-depth \nknowledge of consumer behaviors, wields powerful influence across \nmany sections of society, commits \nsignificant investment, and, perhaps \nmost important, has a direct incentive to \nfoster a more active population. In June \n2024, private sector sporting goods \nand fitness industries came together to \nsign a joint statement calling for urgent, \ncoordinated action to address the \ngrowing physical inactivity crisis. The \nstatement was signed by leading sporting \ngoods players and members of WFSGI as \nwell as other sporting goods, retail, and \nhealth and fitness federations. WFSGI \ncontinues to play an important role in \naligning the sporting goods industry to \ntackle physical inactivity.35 The industry \nis already taking the lead on this issue, \nusing its global platform and powerful \ncollective voice to raise awareness\u2014for \nexample, at the World Economic Forum\u2019s \nAnnual Meeting in Davos.\nBut the challenge is too large for the \nindustry to tackle alone. Increasing \nphysical activity will require governments, \neducational institutions, employers, \nand healthcare professionals to further \nstep up with significant intersectoral \ncollaboration. \n33  Pentland Brands via WFSGI, January 2025.\n34 Shimano via WFSGI, January 2025.\n35 Adult physical inactivity levels reach all-time high , WFSGI, June 26, 2024.\n27\nSporting Goods 2025 higher price because of the brand and the \nimpression and feeling its goods confer  \nto consumers.\nLululemon has historically been a \ncombination of those two things in our \nown way. We believe we command a \nprice premium because our products are \nbetter. At the same time, we represent \nan active lifestyle that is aspirational for \nmany consumers. \nWe could deconstruct our products and \nput them back together with the same \nattributes and utility, and we\u2019re still \ncreating an incremental willingness to \npay among consumers. That\u2019s driven by \nthe brand. I think it\u2019s the combination of \nhoning our purpose and having a distinct \npoint of view that elevates people. Making \nproducts that no other brand offers or \nhas conceived of reinforces Lululemon\u2019s \npromise. If more people come into the Active lifestyle as a value \nand an identity\nGiven the evolution of the athleisure \nmarket, where are companies focusing \nfor growth? \nOver the past 25 years, we\u2019ve moved \nfrom creating the market to developing \nand expanding it. Now, brands are in a \nnew phase, where they need to think \nabout fighting commoditization\u2014or \nrather, how to position against it. \nMeanwhile, consumers are reassessing \ntheir discretionary spending. People \nhave a lot of choices, so companies have \nto deliver products that consumers want \nand that are the best quality.\nThe market\u2019s growth and composition are \nforcing players to redefine their offerings. \nWhen it comes to brand strategy, it\u2019s \nimportant to distinguish between premium \nand luxury. Premium goods have a higher \nprice because you\u2019re getting more utility \nand function. Luxury products have a Rachel Acheson, SVP of enterprise strategy \nand futures innovation, Lululemon\nmarket and we are the best product, we \nwill disproportionately take market share \nand grow as a result.\nHow are you balancing the pursuit of \ngrowth with profitability in times of \ncost inflation? \nLululemon is at its best when it is on its \nfront foot, so we embrace a dual agenda. \nThe future is created through growth, \nbut you have to have an eye on margins. \nStakeholders want both, so it\u2019s about \nmaking trade-offs. On the first point, we \nare a growth-driven company. The market \nrewards growth, and we hire people who \nthrive in growth and are rewarded for it.\nYet we obviously value the bottom line. \nEmphasizing productivity, especially in \nan uncertain economic environment, \nis critical.

Whatever your activity\u2014\nwhether it is being a parent or sitting on \na board or running a marathon\u2014feeling \nyour best is aspirational. For brands, it is an opportunity to \nconnect with the customer on an \nemotional level\u2014in part by promoting all \nthe values, principles, and attributes that \nare wrapped up in products and what \nthey enable consumers to do. It is not only \nabout functionality and how one looks \nin a product; it is ultimately about how a \nproduct makes you feel.\nThe age of GLP-1 is changing the \nnature of health and well-being. How \ndo you see the industry adapting?\nIn recent years, society has increasingly \nprioritized health and well-being, \nprimarily by enhancing mindfulness, \nstress relief, and athletic performance. \nTraditionally, yoga has been one of the \nmost effective tools for achieving these \ngoals.

McKinsey\u2019s latest survey of these \nactive consumers in the sporting goods industry revealed \nan expanding gap in activity levels, with physically inactive \nand active cohorts drifting ever further apart.36 For those \nalready engaged in activity, exercise has evolved from a \ncasual pursuit into a linchpin of health regimens and a \ndefining element of personal identity. This shift stretches \nbeyond the decade-long athleisure trend, heralding a deeper \ntransformation in which an active lifestyle has become a \ncentral touchstone for a growing share of consumers.\n1.  Widening activity gap: The gap between physically active and inactive people is growing. While \n31 percent of adults are inactive, one-third of those who are active are exercising more regularly \nthan one year ago.\n2.  Increasing cultural relevance of fitness as core identity: Health, wellness, and fitness have \nbecome integral to consumers\u2019 lifestyles globally, with almost one in two active consumers and a \nsignificant portion of Gen Zers and millennials viewing fitness as their core identity.\n3.  Growing number of \u2018super active\u2019 consumers: Active consumers are becoming more active, \nwith one in four exercising six or seven times a week.\n1.  Enhance product design and marketing: Develop products that meet the emotional  \nand functional needs of active consumers, emphasizing both technical benefits and life-  \nstyle alignment.\n2.  Foster brand\u2013consumer connection: Create deep personal connections with consumers by \naligning brand values with their active lifestyles and engaging with communities to build loyalty.\n3.

Among active consumers who \nresponded to the McKinsey Sporting \nGoods Report Consumer Survey,  \n54 percent prioritize exercise and 51 \npercent regard fitness and an active \nlifestyle as essential to their identity. \nAmong Gen Zers and millennials, the \nnumbers climb higher still: 55 percent say \nthat an active lifestyle is fundamental to \nwho they are, and 60 percent exercise \nto bolster their self-image. These \nresults highlight the increasing cultural relevance of fitness as a core identity of \nactive consumers.37\nAs TRX Chief Executive Officer Jack Daly \nobserves, \u201cHealth, wellness, and fitness \nhave become deeply ingrained in the \nculture\u2014not only in the US but also across \nEurope and Asia, and it is emerging in the \nMiddle East as well.\u201d \n \nGrowing number of \u2018super \nactive\u2019 consumers\nAs a result of the increased emphasis on \nfitness, some consumers have adopted \nhealthier routines with greater dedication. \nOur analysis reveals that already-active \nindividuals are ramping up their efforts \n(Exhibit 7).

We decided to focus on high-end \ndrop bar bikes. We wanted to be number \none in this niche, and day by day, month by \nmonth, we started to see the results. Our \nconsumers are more engaged because \nwe are authentic to our brand. We are \nspecialists in the road-cycling segment \nand its customer base. That\u2019s the truth of \nour company, and our consumers respond \npositively to it. \nSport is becoming an ever-increasing \npart of people\u2019s identity. What\u2019s  \nyour view on the consumer\u2019s need for \nyour brand?\nPeople have become more fragmented \nand disconnected from each other \nbecause of influences such as social \nmedia and the pandemic. People don\u2019t \nnecessarily have a place to go for \nguidance and support anymore. They feel \nlost. They want help shaping their sense \nof identity and finding a community. I\u2019ll \ngive you an example. In Italy, we used \nto have playgrounds near the churches. \nWhether you went to church or not, you The sports car of road cycling\nLooking back at 2024, what are your \nmain takeaways?\nFrom Colnago\u2019s perspective, it was \namazing. Almost four years ago, we \ndecided to strategically focus on our \nstrengths of our heritage and identity \ninstead of trying to be everything in \nthe bicycle industry. We kept our focus \nspecifically on road bikes and the \ngrowing segment of gravel bikes. Being \nattentive and dedicated to a specific \ngroup of consumers is coherent with our \nstory and allows us to put all our efforts  \nin one basket. At the end of the day, it \npays off. \nMore generally, however, the cycling \nmarket and the sports market are clearly \nsuffering. The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas been tough on companies. I had \npredicted that the industry would be \nout of this negative cycle sooner, but \nthat hasn\u2019t been the case. Consumers \nare more conscious about what they\u2019re \nbuying. A lot of families now have \nfinancial issues that they didn\u2019t have a \nfew years ago. Despite these challenges, \nmany companies are still trying to be \neverything for every consumer instead \nof focusing on their strengths. My \nsuggestion is that companies return to \nthe core of their business to realign with \nwhat their customer really wants.Nicola Rosin, CEO, Colnago\nwere allowed to go on this playground \nwhere you could talk, socialize, and play \nevery kind of sport. However, like many \nother types of communities, this doesn\u2019t \nexist anymore. So people must now find \nways to fulfill this need for community \nand have started looking to brands and \ncompanies for guidance on their identity \nand lifestyle. Companies started to \nrealize that their success lies in becoming \nthat community. When our customers \nstart connecting with each other, whether \nbecause they\u2019re a road cyclist or just love \nthe brand, they start using the brand to \nshape how they think about themselves. \nBrands such as Ferrari or Apple have \nunderstood and internalized this for \na long time. Our story and community \nare very important because they give \nour consumers a sense of identity \nand purpose. We recognize we have a \nresponsibility to supply much more than \na product. \nWhere are you looking for growth, and \nwhere do you think the broader cycling \nindustry could find growth now?\nAn area of growth we focus on is how we \ncan define Colnago as an exclusive brand \nrather than a high-end road brand. If you \nare exclusive and focused on your core \nbusiness, you can extend beyond it. In \nour case, it looks like services such as \n\u2018 My suggestion is that companies return  \nto the core of their business to realign \nwith what their customer really wants.\u2019\n36\nSporting Goods 2025 Nicola Rosin  is the CEO of Colnago, a renowned Italian manufacturer of high-\nend bicycles. He has been instrumental in positioning Colnago as a premium \nbrand, and his vision is to make Colnago \u201cthe most desirable bicycle brand in \nthe world.\u201d\norganizing and selling a very high-end \ncycling trip or creating a partnership \nto offer other exclusive products while \nstaying within our specialization. We \nhave an amazing opportunity to explore \noutside our core product because we are \nsuccessful in a super-high-end market. \nWe are the number one company selling \nbicycles for more than \u20ac15,000. \nRegarding the broader cycling business, \nthere are big opportunities in the online \nspace. We have consumers who are \nready to buy a superpremium bicycle \nonline. This shows me that with the right \nproduct, attitude, and presentation, \nonline channels could be very interesting \nto pursue. \nThe other opportunity is R&D on our core \nbusiness. When we can focus on our \nstrengths and create better products, the \nconsumers will always be there, especially \nin sports, where a product can improve \nperformance or comfort. People will go for \nproducts that really give them benefits: a \nmore comfortable saddle or tire, a more aerodynamic frame. You can grow by \nfocusing on creating better solutions for a \nvery demanding sportive consumer.\nWhen you look toward 2025, what are \nyour concerns, and what gives you hope \nand inspires optimism?\nI am concerned for Colnago and for \nthe industry because of the ongoing \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical climate. \nWe are affected by these issues daily. \nYou can be the best brand and CEO with \nthe best bicycle in the world, but if your \nsupply chains are compromised or you \nare facing some geopolitical issue, you\u2019re \ngoing to struggle. I don\u2019t know when \nit\u2019s going to end, if ever, and that can be \nscary. We\u2019re living in uncertain times, and \nthat\u2019s a big topic for CEOs in this era.\nAt the same time, I am very optimistic  \nfor my company because we achieved  \nthe dream that we had four years ago:  \nto be one of the most desirable brands  \nin cycling.\u2018 An area of growth we focus  \non is how we can define Colnago  \nas an exclusive brand rather \nthan a high-end road brand.\u2019\nComments and opinions expressed by \ninterviewees are their own and do not \nrepresent or reflect the opinions, policies,  \nor positions of McKinsey & Company or  \nhave its endorsement.\n37\nSporting Goods 2025 Market share \nupheaval with \nlarge incumbents \nbeing challenged \nto up their game\n38\nSporting Goods 2025 Competition between large \nincumbents and challenger \nbrands will likely intensify \nand is currently benefiting \ncompetitors that are \nmore sharply positioned.\nThese brands have been \nsuccessful by implementing \nstrategies to reach specific \nconsumer segments. In \nthis new landscape, the \npath to success likely \nlies in preserving their \nvalue proposition or \ndeveloping a mindfully \ncurated house of brands. 1.  Intensifying competition: The competition between historically large \nincumbents and smaller and challenger brands is intensifying as the \nlatter outpace incumbents in revenue growth and rapidly gain market \nshare. As a result, challenger brands captured three percentage \npoints of the market from large incumbents between 2019 and 2024.\n2.  Strategic focus: Smaller and challenger brands succeed by crafting \nsharp value propositions tailored to specific segments, leveraging \nvisible innovation, and tapping into cultural marketing.\n3.  Distribution and manufacturing advantage:  The shift has been \ndriven by factors such as easier access to distribution channels \nthrough strategic wholesale partnerships (vacated by the large \nincumbents) and a well-developed network of third-party \nmanufacturers of smaller and challenger brands.\n4.  Increasing investor interest: Investors are increasingly favoring \nup-and-coming sportswear brands, highlighting the need for \nincumbents to refresh their strategies to stay competitive.\n1.  Innovate and differentiate: Incumbents need to enhance their value \npropositions with visible innovations and emotional connections to \nresonate with niche markets and maintain competitiveness.\n2.  Grow but keep authentic core: For smaller and challenger brands, \nit is important to maintain the growth trajectory by keeping their \nauthentic core and focusing on their niche segments.\n3.  Embrace multichannel strategies: Ensure a mix of direct-to-\nconsumer and wholesale strategies to expand reach and build brand \ncredibility, following the successful models of smaller and challenger \nbrands.\n4.  Explore growth archetypes: Consider expanding into adjacent \ncategories or adopting a house-of-brands model (for example, \nthrough acquisitions) to scale effectively while retaining brand \nidentity and consumer loyalty.Key insights\nExecutive priorities\n39\nSporting Goods 2025 Exhibit 9The landscape has shifted\u2014\nsubstantially and rapidly \nOver the past decade, the sporting \ngoods market has witnessed a \nproliferation of new entrants, including \nboth general apparel players that have \nstrategically expanded their portfolios \nto feature activewear and specialized \nplayers offering a tightly focused value \nproposition for segments such as \nrunning, yoga, cycling, or gym attire. This \nspecialization has enabled challenger \nbrands to tap more deeply into the identity \nof consumers who gravitate toward brands that feel more \u201cfor me\u201d rather \nthan \u201cfor anyone.\u201d Coupled with declining \nbarriers to entry, this specialization has \nfueled the rise of challenger brands. \nFactors including easier access to \ndistribution (via both wholesale and \ndirect-to-consumer channels), a \nmature ecosystem of third-party textile \nmanufacturers, and abundant venture \ncapital and private equity funding have \nenabled many fledgling players to scale \nrapidly. Consider On: Founded in 2010 and \ndriven by R&D and innovation, On secured \nearly investment, expanded through wholesale and a targeted retail strategy, \nwent public in 2021, and was on track to \nsurpass $2.53 billion in revenue by 2024.46 \nIn a telling sign of industry realignment, \nchallenger brands have eclipsed large \nincumbents Adidas and Nike in revenue \ngrowth and hence market share gains.47  \nFrom 2019 to 2024, publicly traded \nchallenger brands expanded at a faster \nrate; the two large incumbents ceded \nthree percentage points of market share \nto challenger brands during this period \n(Exhibit 9).48  \nWeb <2025>\n<MCK241115 Sporting Goods Report 2025>\nExhibit <9> of <11>\nMarket share evolution of sportswear market, 2019\u201324\n1Large incumbents are Nike and Adidas.\n2Including both older already scaled challenger brands such as Lululemon and On as well as newer smaller challenger brands such as Arc\u2019teryx and Hoka.\nSource: Euromonitor International Apparel & Footwear 2025 EditionThe two largest incumbent brands lost about three percentage points of \nmarket share between 2019 and 2024.\nMcKinsey & Company2019\u201324, \npercentage point (pp) change\n2019\n2022\n73\n74\n27\n26\n100\n100\nSeries 1\n2024\nestimated\n76\n24\n100\n\u20133 pp \nLarge incumbents\n+3 pp \nDriven by challenger brands\u00b2Large \nincumbents\u00b9 \nRest of market \n(including \nchallenger brands)\n46 Dylan Kelly, \u201cOn Running expects to make more than $2.6 billion USD this year,\u201d Hypebeast, November 13, 2024.\n47 Euromonitor International Apparel & Footwear 2025 Edition.\n48 Euromonitor International Apparel & Footwear 2025 Edition; The State of Fashion 2025: Challenges at every turn , McKinsey, November 11, 2024.\n40\nSporting Goods 2025 Increasing investor interest\nInvestors have taken note. In the past year, \nshare prices of challenger brands and \ncompanies such as Amer Sports (parent \ncompany of Arc\u2019teryx), On, and Deckers \n(parent company of Hoka) registered \nsubstantial gains (Exhibit 10). Such results \nhighlight the need for incumbent brands to \nreconsider their strategies if they hope to \nstave off growing competition.\nPrivate capital has also flocked to \nemerging names. An illustrative example is \nthe $825 million investment led by General \nAtlantic and Stripes in Vuori, a California-\nbased challenger brand whose offerings \nbridge fitness and everyday wear. \nFounded in 2015, Vuori was valued at  \n$5.5 billion in 2024.49\n \nExploring the recent success \nof challenger brands \nHow have newer brands managed to \nexpand their market share so rapidly? At a \nhigh level, they have focused on pursuing \nspecific pockets of growth and expanding \ntheir reach in several ways.50\nCrafting a sharper value proposition. \nLarge incumbents cast a wide net, \nhoping to maintain a strong presence \nacross multiple sports. By contrast, \nchallengers focus on specific segments \nand overlooked demographics to build \na sharp value proposition. Lululemon \nstarted its journey in women\u2019s athletic \nwear and has successfully expanded \nfrom there. Arc\u2019teryx has concentrated on \noutdoor enthusiasts, offering functionality \nand positioning its brand as the go-to \nchoice for high-performance, durable \ngear tailored to extreme conditions and \nadventurous pursuits. The company\u2019s \nofferings come with an emotional payoff \nfor consumers who see activewear as a \nvehicle for self-expression. In these \u201ccool\u201d \nsegments, shoppers often pay a premium \nfor brands that reflect their identity.\nDelivering visible innovation with \nplatform potential. Incumbents generally \nrely on incremental performance gains that may go unnoticed by everyday \ncustomers. Challenger brands, however, \nunveil eye-catching features that resonate \nwith consumers and define products. \nHoka touts its oversize midsoles, while \nOn leverages its distinctive CloudTec \nsoles and has expanded into 3D-printed \nfootwear\u2014tactics that spark consumer \ninterest and sustain an air of innovation.\nTapping into cultural marketing. Alo Yoga \nand New Balance have turned to celebrity \nendorsements and cultural ties to elevate \ntheir brands, while Gymshark, Hoka, \nand Vuori nurture authenticity through \ngrassroots marketing and community \nbuilding.

This allows us to \nalso focus on the trends of infusing sports \ninto lifestyles and people being more \nhealth-conscious in general and bringing \nsportswear into everyday life. \nAs a challenger brand, On has not only \ncaptured a significant portion of the \noverall market growth\u2014we\u2019ve also gained \nmarket share from established players. \nYou see, the running shoe industry had \nstagnated when it comes to innovation \nprior to our arrival in 2010. Consumers \nwere craving something new, and we Samuel Wenger, COO, On\nquick moves, and quickly go to markets \nso we can bring that innovation to the \nconsumer swiftly.\nOf course, trends will always come and \ngo, but we never want to rely on the \nzeitgeist of what is in and out of fashion \nnow. If you have a core of innovation and \nthe underlying technologies, you will \nalways have a reason to exist.\nTen years ago, the athleisure \nmovement blurred the lines between \nsport and everyday apparel. How  \nhas On seen its customers change  \nhow they connect with the brand and \ntheir identity? \nLooking back at the post-COVID-19 \nlandscape, we saw the public\u2019s growing \nhealth consciousness and desire to \nmove. The pandemic really highlighted \nthe importance of movement, both for \nour physical and mental health. We saw \na surge of people embracing outdoor \nactivities and finding new ways to stay \nactive.

With On, Wenger \nleads the mission to ignite the human \nspirit through movement. broader audience that might be less aware \nthat movement comes in many forms.\nAt On, you\u2019re growing not only \ngeographically but also in terms of \ncategory and customer appeal. How do \nyou expand while staying true to your \ncore values and the identity you\u2019ve built?\nOn has always been deeply rooted in \nperformance. Our mission\u2014to ignite \nthe human spirit through movement\u2014\nguides everything we do. We strive to \nbe the leading premium performance \nsportswear brand, built on innovation, \ndesign, and sustainability. This drives  \nour expansion. \nAs we expand into new areas, such \nas tennis, weight training, and other \nforms of movement, our approach \nremains consistent. We first build the \nbest-performing, pinnacle gear for \nour athletes, then from there create \nproducts more suited to everyday sports \nand lifestyles. This process allows \nus to achieve a level of authenticity \nthat resonates with consumers. By \ncollaborating with top athletes and \ncultural influencers, we build credibility \nand trust. This authentic connection is \nsomething we deeply value and prioritize \nin everything we do.\nHow does On connect with  \nits customers?\nA big part of our mission is raising \nawareness. Many people are inactive, \neither because they\u2019re unaware of the \nbenefits of movement or they feel too \nintimidated to get started. We believe \nin breaking down those barriers by \nproviding education and access.Take running, for example. We\u2019ve \nseen a massive movement of people \nembracing run clubs and identifying with \nrunning culture. Running has become \nan expression of their lifestyle. We\u2019ve \nhosted Clubhouse Nights that hundreds \nof people attend, and they leave with \nnew styles that they integrate into their \neveryday lives. \nThe most important thing is that people \ncan relate to something\u2014that\u2019s where \nthe power comes from. People need \nto connect with what we\u2019re doing. \nOur collaborations with celebrities \nand professional athletes have been \nincredibly successful in this regard. When \nyou have athletes or cultural influencers \ncredibly or almost organically adopting \nOn products and you\u2019re able to tell \nthe story of the people using them, it \nbuilds trust and strengthens our brand \nnarrative. It goes beyond just the product \nitself; it\u2019s about connecting with our \nmission and values.\nWhile some consumers prioritize pure \nperformance metrics, especially for our \nhigh-performance gear, many are drawn \nto the On brand and what it represents. \nFor many consumers, the more important \nconsideration is the brand, what it stands \nfor, and how they relate to it. They might \nfeel more inclined to adopt the everyday \nproduct over the pinnacle race product. \nLooking at the market ahead, what \nmakes you optimistic, and what could \nbe potential challenges?\nWhile there\u2019s always some uncertainty \nabout the future, especially heading into \n2025, we\u2019re incredibly confident in our \ndirection. The increased desire of people to move and the willingness to pay for \npremium products are enduring trends. \nAs long as people want to move, we\u2019ll be \nthere to support them with innovative \nproducts and inspiring experiences.\nWhen we look to 2025, we\u2019re coming out \nof the past couple of years feeling quite \npositive and reinforced in the belief that \nour mission to ignite the human spirit \nthrough movement will always be there. \nThere will inevitably be some disruption, \nbut we\u2019ve learned to live with it and be \nnimble and even turn it into an advantage. \nWe also have very strong relationships \nwith our partners\u2014they want to make us \nsuccessful, too.

The McKinsey Sporting \nGoods Report Consumer Survey found \nthat 81 percent of respondents attended \nin-person fitness classes in the past \nyear\u2014nearly two and a half times as many \nas those who used online fitness classes.52 \nFitness consumers reported increasing \ntheir spending on boutique studio classes \nand fitness club memberships in the \npast 12 months, a trend that is poised to \ncontinue in the next year and beyond.53 \nBoutique studio classes particularly \nbenefited from this trend; almost one in two \nconsumers spent more in the past year, and \none in three consumers plans to continue \nspending more, indicating an even higher \ndemand in the future.54\nConsumers choose in-person fitness \nclasses primarily to boost their motivation \nand consistency: 65 percent of respondents cited the draw of exercising \naround others, and 40 percent reported \nliking the group atmosphere and energy. \nSlightly more than one-third found \nin-person classes to be more challenging \nthan training alone.55\nHowever, many consumers are also \nlooking to fitness for connection with \nothers: Approximately one-quarter \nof consumers participated in group \nfitness classes to increase their sense of \ncommunity or belonging and to meet  \nnew people.56\nThe interest in connecting with a like-\nminded community explains the rapid \nrise in social exercise clubs. Brands have \nstarted to capitalize on this trend to \nboost awareness of their products and \npromote innovations. For instance, On \nholds weekly run clubs that are free to the \npublic at more than ten flagship locations \naround the world, giving participants the \nopportunity to test shoes. Nike is opening a network of studios offering three types \nof group fitness experiences\u2014functional \nstrength and conditioning, running, and \nweightlifting\u2014supported and enhanced \nwith connectivity through its Studios app. \nHow will the demand for in-person \nversus remote fitness evolve? In an \ninterview for this report, TRX CEO Jack \nDaly said he expects consumers to \nmaintain their preference for in-person \nworkouts while the convenience of \nremote fitness will keep digital solutions \nrelevant. Sporting goods players need \nto cater to both audiences to maximize \ntheir growth opportunities.\n \nBlurring boundaries among \nsports, retail, and entertainment\nThe isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic \nled to pent-up demand for live events, \nand the past two years have seen a \npersistent surge in attendance. According \nto McKinsey estimates, the ticketing \nmarket for global live events surpassed \n$100 billion in 2023 and could reach $150 \nbillion by 2030 (Exhibit 11). Sporting events \naccount for about half of this total and \nenjoy growing popularity. For instance, the \nUnion of European Football Associations \n(UEFA) reports that in-person attendance \nat European football matches in the \n2023\u201324 season reached approximately \n221 million people\u2014a 7 percent jump over \nthe previous season.57 \nAs a result of this demand for live \nexperiences, more venues are blending \nsports, entertainment, and retail. \nRetail spaces as venues for  \ncommunity events  \nSporting goods brands are pursuing \ninnovative approaches to cater to the \nthirst for live, unique experiences. For \ninstance, Adidas has experimented with \npop-up stores and dedicated events at \nflagship locations, airports, and fan zones \n(areas near sports stadiums), to promote \nhyperlocal products. These initiatives \nnot only create exclusive experiences for \nconsumers through selective campaign \nextensions at local physical events but also \n52 McKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer Survey, December 2024 (total n = 3,606; active consumers n = 1,842).\n53 McKinsey Future of Wellness Survey, December 2024.\n54 McKinsey Future of Wellness Survey, December 2024.\n55 McKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer Survey, December 2024 (total n = 3,606; active consumers n = 1,842).\n56 McKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer Survey, December 2024 (total n = 3,606; active consumers n = 1,842).\n57 The European club talent and competition landscape , UEFA, 2024.The interest in \nconnecting with a like-\nminded community \nexplains the rapid rise \nin social exercise clubs. \nBrands have started to \ncapitalize on this trend \nto boost awareness \nof their products and \npromote innovations.\n48\nSporting Goods 2025 Exhibit 11enhance brand loyalty and driving sales. The \nresults are notable: 50 percent of Adidas \ncustomers say they feel more loyal to the \nbrand, in part because of its community-\ndriven and hyperlocal events.58 Adidas views \nthese events as an opportunity to increase \nfoot traffic and attract new visitors as well as \ngenerate extra buzz on social media. \nMixed-use stadiums to attract a \nbroader audience beyond sports fans  \nNew stadiums are being designed as \nmultipurpose complexes, creating vibrant \nhubs around stadiums by blending live sports, entertainment, and retail.

The Tottenham Hotspur \nStadium in London, which opened in 2019 \nand was built for \u00a31 billion, is a state-of-\nthe-art facility that hosts various sporting \nevents as well as concerts, corporate \nevents, parties, and other large-scale \nevents.59 Similarly, the redevelopment of the \nformer Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo is a $5.8 \nbillion project that spans 20 hectares.60 The \nfuture complex will include a stadium to host \nsports competitions, live events, and trade \nshows, serving as a major hub combining \ncommerce, leisure attractions, hospitality \nproperties, and transport. \nNew sports formats featuring \ncompetition and spectacle  \nAmping up the entertainment factor in \ntraditional sports leagues has broadened \nthe appeal and audience for such \nofferings.

As \nconsumers increasingly seek community-\noriented fitness experiences with an \nentertainment angle, brands that can \neffectively combine in-person and digital \nofferings will be well positioned to thrive.\nBlending sports and entertainment \nthrough live events has proved a lucrative strategy even for brands in \nindustries outside sporting goods. In \n2012, Red Bull produced the Stratos \nevent, which involved Austrian skydiver \nFelix Baumgartner free-falling from \nthe stratosphere, breaking the sound \nbarrier in the process.63 The company \nhas established a niche that not \nonly reinforces its brand identity but \nalso generates substantial revenue \nthrough sponsorship and advertising, \nmerchandising, and content monetization \n(for example, revenues from YouTube, \ndocumentary sales, and TV streaming). \nThis strategy continues to be successful \nto this day.\nSporting goods players can follow this \nexample by partnering with other players \nor operating their own live events.

Those markets could be \npoised for growth, so we\u2019re adapting our \napproach to meet those customers where \nthey are in their journey.\nWe\u2019ll achieve our twin goals of growth and \nprofitability by continuing to modernize \nthe experience across channels. Since we \nare a retailer and a brand, we will maintain \na strong focus on stores while investing in \ninnovation for products in key categories. \nSimilarly, we\u2019re mindful of tailoring our \nofferings to different segments. We are \ncontinuing to embrace more-specialized \nbrands, which often target consumers \nwith higher purchasing power. We are \nbuilding brands such as Van Rysel and \nKiprun that have been enjoying rising \npopularity in recent years. We\u2019ll also \nmarket to consumers in the entry price \npoint segment, who have felt increased \npressure on their discretionary spending. \nWe think the answer is to push for \nsustainability, circularity, repair, and \nsubscription models. \nAs a company, you have given yourself \nhighly aspirational sustainability \nobjectives. How has Decathlon \nincorporated sustainability into its \nstrategy? \nIt\u2019s critical to find ways to embed \nsustainability and circularity into Ready to play? Decathlon is!\nWhat were the main trends and \nchallenges you saw in 2024? \nSeveral developments stand out. The \nfirst was the success of sport in terms \nof engagement with fans. The Olympics \nhad a huge impact across Europe, \nin part because our society needs \nuplifted. The Games were a positive \nconfirmation of the power of sport. \nSecond, the geopolitical situation we \nlive in is extremely complex, and that \nhas an effect all along the value chain\u2014\nproduction, transportation, freight, and \nconsumption. The third development is \nclimate change. Its trajectory is having a \ngreater effect on sporting goods. Winter \nsports, for example, are already suffering \nsignificantly. We have a robust plan \nto do our part, but the sporting goods \ncompanies need to determine what \ncollective role we are going to play in \naddressing this challenge. \nWhich markets and customer \nsegments are you prioritizing for \ngrowth in 2025?\nDecathlon is focused on mature and less-\nmature markets alike. Each market brings \nits own dynamics. If you think about the \nMiddle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, \nfor example, sports are less federated, \norganized, and business-driven than in Celine Del Genes, global chief \ncustomer officer, Decathlon\nour business. Sustainability has two \nprimary components: reducing CO\u2082 \nand reassessing the business model. \nWe take our role to protect nature very \nseriously. Even though we are a growing \nbusiness, we are decreasing our CO\u2082 \nfootprint by changing how we design and \nmanufacture products. \nWe are also investing in circularity. \nCustomers can go to Decathlon and rent \na bike for their child. That means that \nas the child grows, families don\u2019t need \nto throw the bike away or keep it in the \ngarage. Renting ensures the child always \nhas the right bike. At the same time, \nthose bikes are in continuous use, which \nis much better for nature. To support \nthis offering, we\u2019ve added ateliers in \nour stores to repair bikes and guide \ncustomers. \nWe believe we\u2019re shifting the industry\u2019s \nperspective on sustainability, but it\u2019s \nnot easy logistically. We now provide \nwraparound services, such as repair and \nmaintenance, and buy back items\u2014all \nwhile ensuring consistent quality. Those \nelements are transforming the way we\u2019re \nengaging with consumers.\nIn 2025, we aim to continue building \nout our circularity strategy, including \nexpanding our repair and subscription \nofferings. We\u2019ll also adapt our practices \nto address sustainability. It will be critical \nto bring customers with us on that \njourney\u2014and value will be a key element \nof this strategy. Customers demand value \nand appreciate the link to sustainability, \nbut it\u2019s not value at all costs; that\u2019s an \nimportant distinction. Products must \ndeliver good value for money, but they \ncan\u2019t be cheap, because goods made in \npoor conditions have an impact on the \nworld. Value and sustainability will be \nmore and more intertwined. \u2018 We\u2019ll achieve our twin goals \nof growth and profitability by \ncontinuing to modernize the \nexperience across channels.\u2019\n52\nSporting Goods 2025 Celine Del Genes  is the global chief customer officer at Decathlon, a global leader \nin sporting goods and active-lifestyle products. Celine is dedicated to enhancing \ncustomer experience and driving the company\u2019s mission of making sports accessible \nto all, ensuring that every customer feels inspired and empowered to embrace an \nactive life.\nDo you see rising physical inactivity \nlevels across the world as a threat, and \nhow is Decathlon responding?\nPhysical activity is a key element in \nDecathlon\u2019s engagement strategy. We \nlaunched Ready to Play? to make sports \nless intimidating and performance-\noriented. For us, sport is about the joy of \nphysical activity. That\u2019s a more inclusive \nsentiment for the masses than the elite; \nnot everyone can be Messi or Ronaldo. \nThe rise of newer sports\u2014such as \npickleball in the US and urban street \nsports such as skating\u2014and the \npopularity of table tennis in the Olympic \nGames offer opportunities. They are \nmore community-driven and accessible; \nit\u2019s cheaper to do paddleball than tennis \nbecause you split the court with four \npeople. Those lower barriers and the \nsocial aspect can draw new participants. \nWe developed a product offering that \nlowers the cost barrier, making sports \nmore accessible to everyone. Beyond \nthat, we run programs worldwide to \nencourage people to explore sports or \nuse them as a means to transform and \nenhance their lives. For example, the \nVitalsport program enables families to \ntry a variety of sports, serving nearly half \na million people across more than 30 \ncountries.\nI also believe the notion of health and \nwellness will continue to develop. The \nmore stress you have from work or the \ngeopolitical environment, the more you \nneed to find an escape. And that escape, in my opinion, is twofold. One is health \nand wellness\u2014yoga, Pilates, meditation, \nall those elements\u2014and one is nature\u2014\nhiking, running, biking, and any activity \npeople can do to enjoy the outdoors.  \nI expect those types of activities to grow \nin popularity. \nDecathlon takes a distinctive approach \nto community engagement and live \nevents. What are the ways you bring it \nto life? \nOur marketing, programming, and \nphysical stores all play a part. In regard \nto marketing: For this year\u2019s Olympic \nGames, we concentrated our involvement \nnot on the athletes but on the volunteers \nto celebrate the ones who actually \nmake the Games happen. I think that\u2019s \ndistinctive in the world of sport because \nno one paid that much attention to the \nvolunteers before. We treated them like \nthe heroes of the Games\u2014because they \nare.\nSecond, we launched programs that \nseek to connect people with their local \ncommunity. This approach came from \nthe recognition that many people are \nsettling for virtual experiences through \ntheir phones rather than interacting with \nthe physical world. We already have an \nannual event called Vitalsport, which is all \nabout discovery. It creates a link between \nlocal sport organizations, our stores, \nand customers. Bringing those elements \ntogether supports community building \nand engagement. Last, we\u2019ve always been anchored on \nthe experience we create in our physical \nstores. A lot of customers know that if \nthey come with their family, their kids can \nplay in our stores. We don\u2019t stop people \nfrom shooting a ball in the store.

Tired of dipping, what to look for?

Trump\u2019s proposed BTC reserve lacks congressional approval and risks being reversed by the next administration. Its direct market impact may be limited due to existing U.S. BTC exposure, as they are more likely to take BTC from balance sheets rather than buy from the open market. However, this move could significantly influence corporate and international strategies. Crypto reserve may dilute BTC value: Mixing BTC with other crypto reserves could weaken its position. If a crypto reserve is framed as a dollar backing (let\u2019s hope not), it would raise concerns about USD stability, and driving higher rates. Now, Trump\u2019s policy seems very self-interested. Broader ETF markets and More types: stETH ETF is under development\u2014a boost for ETH staking if approved. $SOL ETF this year is also highly likely, many \u201cMicrostrategy\u201d for Solana are emerging, driving staking interest. Growing attention in $BTC ETF access for Chinese investors (huge question mark), but with custodians well-positioned. Funds and talent will flow in over time because macro policy, regardless of short-term volatility. Market: Whirling Between Casino, Yield, and Value There are two dominant types of traders: 1. Casino Gamblers \u2013 chasing 1000x leverage in PvP battles. 1. Yield Farmers \u2013 seeking steady, low-risk returns. Anyone in between contributes little volume but could change over time. Type 1 Gamblers: \u201cProtect Our Fair Casino!\u201d Solana meme had a PMF, but after series rugs of Trump, Melania, and Libra, plus insider trading, damaged market liquidity, and more importantly, the fairness of the casino. DEXs now try to restore trust via sniper sorting, Dutch auctions, and forcing community airdrops, trying to bring back volume once macro shifts. Type 2 Whales: \"Win Our Trust by Security and Time\" Yield farmers with a low-risk appetite won\u2019t chase an extra 10% APY when there\u2019s a risk of going to zero. Ethereum still leads in TVL and security history, while others are working hard. Yields come from DEX emission, lending fees, hedging, T-bills and more\u2014each with its own risk layers. Best projects are trying to reach an intricate balance between the yield and risk, and talk the LPs into it. Type 3 Value-Seekers: \u201cEmerge Under a Clearer Regulatory Framework\u201d The blossom of legitimate on-chain assets, such as Web2 company onchian listing and RWAs, depend on regulatory clarity. Once clear rules emerge, value investing will take shape\u2014when revenue buybacks are no longer minimal compared to its market cap and tokens serve real utility, attracting value-seeking investors on-chain. Blockchains: When High TPS Becomes a Commodity Solana: @solana 's biggest moat is its perfect PMF, now expanding to political and br oa der advantage. Price dictates perception\u2014 SIMD-0228 is designed to support SOL\u2019s price long-term by associating staking rates with emissions. Imagine a SOL ETF \u2192 More staking \u2192 Lower emissions \u2192 Stronger price stability. DEXs on Solana are addressing liquidity drains and trust issues, while perpetuals leverage rollups/ephemeral rollups to enhance performance (@ZetaMarkets, @magicblock). Meanwhile, @ranger_finance aggregates perps. Banking, payments, and stablecoins are expanding rapidly: \u2022 @meow offers yield-generating U.S. business checking accounts. \u2022 @sphere_labs provides che aper off-ram ping alternatives compared to Coinbase. \u2022 @Perena__ is building top-tier infrastructure for stablecoins. Challenges: 1) Protect a fair casino 2) Strengthening DeFi liquidity and robustness 3) Ensuring network stability and security for institutional adoption Hyperliquid</strong\\<strong>> @HyperliquidX 's best moat is its killer app. Now, HyperEVM is live\u2014network revenue comes from not only platform and auction fees but also EVM gas fees. Although this hasn\u2019t yet reflected in token price, it unlocks new $HYPE utilities (gas, lending, staking, and yield mechanisms). High-cap native assets lik e spot BTC ar e finally arriving. Challenges: 1) Hard to maintain an open ecosystem when its native DEXs and perps compete with others. 2) Security risks\u2014Bybit\u2019s multisig had 4 signers and got rugged, while HyperLiquid has only 2. Monad: @monad_xyz 's moat is Hyper-EVM + Open Ecosystem. Monad's testnet has shown steady growth, reaching 120 TPS with no slowdown. While the ecosystem is still in its infancy, openness is crucial to building a more organic environment, avoiding the \u201cking-made\u201d effect seen in other ecosystems. The community has organically grown through projects like Moland ak NFTs. Future: outlook for killer apps in DeFi, consumer, AI, payment, etc. Projects: New and Interesting Ones Only Internet Framework Innovation Scalability often sacrifices decentralization and security, but @doublezero is developing a blockchain-agnostic, base-layer connectivity framework. It optimizes blockchain performance by filtering inbound transactions before reaching validators and improving outbound message routing. Bridging Web2 and Web3 PoW companies have gone public, but no PoS companies have followed. Blockchains need legitimate, reputable validators with a track record. A validator-as-a-service model could bridge regulated public entities and blockchains. Putting BTC (Really) to Work On-chain BTC is either sitting idle, earning minimal yield in lending, or receiving alt inflationary rewards. @yieldbasis is where enabling real BTC-based yield through an AMM with minimized IL. Serving Incoming TradFi Stablecoins remain the most lucrative business in crypto, but Web2 companies face hurdles around regulation, on/off-ramps, and security. @BastionPlatform has secured an NYDFS license, positioning itself as a stablecoin issuer for Web2 giants. Act like You're Non-Crypto Crypto\u2019s biggest edge is its liquidity. @megapot_io is building the largest online jackpot platform, its API serves as a user retention tool for Web2 companies, and on the other hand, could provide linear-growth yield for its stablecoins LP.

    "content": "Mass Market Money Moves: Your Guide\nto Not Building Another Dead App\nbr0th3r 0d1n 4 mins\nThe $585.72B Mobile App Market and the AI/Blockchain\nOpportunity\nThe mobile app market is projected to reach a staggering $585.72 billion\nin 2025. With an annual growth rate of approximately 7.84%, it's\nexpected to hit $781.70 billion by 2029. Within this booming market, AI\nand crypto technologies are emerging as key drivers of innovation and\ndisruption, offering unprecedented opportunities for consumer app\ndevelopment.\nKey Consumer Trends Driving App Growth\nSeveral key consumer trends are fueling the growth of the mobile app\nmarket, particularly within the AI and blockchain sectors:\n- AI Integration for Personalized Experiences: Consumers\nincreasingly expect personalized and intuitive app experiences. AI is\nenabling hyper-personalization, revolutionizing ad targeting, and stream\u2010\nlining creative production, making apps smarter and more adaptive. By\n2025, a significant portion of user-friendly apps will be powered by AI.\n- Growing Demand for Privacy and Data Control: Users are\nbecoming more conscious of their data privacy and are seeking apps that\noffer greater control over their personal information. This trend necessi\u2010\ntates the adoption of privacy-conscious strategies and data handling\nmethods in app development.\n12/03/2025, 19:25 Mass Market Money Moves: Your Guide to Not Building Another Dead App\nabout:blank 1/6\n- Mobile Commerce Dominance: Mobile devices are increasingly\nused for e-commerce transactions. In 2021, over 72.9% of total e-com\u2010\nmerce sales came from mobile devices. This trend indicates a significant\nopportunity for apps that facilitate seamless and secure mobile com\u2010\nmerce experiences.\n- The Rise of \"On-Demand\" Apps: On-demand mobile app develop\u2010\nment is trending upward, mirroring the success of apps like Airbnb and\nUber.\nAI-Powered Apps: The Future is User-Friendly\nGartner reports that approximately 70% of all user-friendly apps will be\npowered by artificial intelligence. This highlights the critical role of AI in\ncreating engaging and personalized user experiences. AI can be used for\npredictive analytics, providing users with tailored product suggestions\nand preferences based on their behavior history. No two users will have\nthe same experience with an AI-powered app, which will be a major com\u2010\nponent of the mass market appeal.\nMajor App Categories Primed for Disruption\nSeveral major app categories are particularly ripe for disruption through\nthe integration of AI and blockchain technologies:\n- Gaming: AI can enhance gaming experiences through personalized\ngameplay, intelligent non-player characters (NPCs), and improved game\ndesign. Blockchain can enable new gaming models, such as play-to-earn,\nwhere players can own and trade in-game assets using NFTs.\n- Entertainment: The entertainment sector is seeing increased con\u2010\nsumer spending on apps, particularly those related to OTT (Over-The-\nTop) and short video content. AI can enhance content recommendation,\npersonalize viewing experiences, and streamline content creation.\n12/03/2025, 19:25 Mass Market Money Moves: Your Guide to Not Building Another Dead App\nabout:blank 2/6\n- Health: Healthcare apps can leverage AI for personalized health moni\u2010\ntoring, early disease detection, and improved patient outcomes.\nBlockchain can ensure data integrity and privacy in healthcare records,\naddressing critical security concerns.\n- Social: Decentralized social media apps built on blockchain can pro\u2010\nvide users with greater control over their data and content, addressing\nprivacy concerns and promoting freedom of expression. AI can enhance\ncontent moderation, personalize user feeds, and improve user\nengagement.\n- Fintech: Digital wallets, powered by AI and secured by blockchain, are\npoised for continued growth in e-commerce. AI can enhance fraud detec\u2010\ntion, personalize financial advice, and automate trading strategies.\nBlockchain can enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, offering\nalternatives to traditional financial services.",

As tech giants like Google roll out frontier models like Gemini 2.5 and test AI-first search features, startups like Perplexity are still managing to stand their ground \u2014 and thrive. Despite the rapid advancements in Google \u2019s AI capabilities, Srinivas argues the company is constrained by its own $72.46 billion ad-driven business model. \u201cIf AI gave you direct answers to the score in a basketball game, how can you sell Ticketmaster ads?\u201d he points out, highlighting why Google can't fully replicate what Perplexity offers without hurting its bottom line. Backing this is Deedy Das , principal at Menlo Ventures , who notes, \u201cGoogle will likely not build the exact same product as Perplexity because it cannibalises its own search business, which pays the bills.\u201d With over $100M in revenue and new funding talks to raise its valuation to $18B, Perplexity is clearly more than just a startup\u2014it\u2019s a rising force. And the next big move? Comet, an AI-powered \u201csidecar browser\u201d that follows users as they browse, answering questions, formatting content, and running research \u2014 all ad-free. As Srinivas puts it: \u201cAnything worth doing is hard. We will persist and find ways around.

    "content": "We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. 1 It\u2019s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes. 2 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d 3 What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations. 6 Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 tabletop exercises and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work. \u201cI highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.\u201d \u2014 Yoshua Bengio 7 We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it\u2019s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the US military to game out Taiwan scenarios. Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn\u2019t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right. Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario before, in August 2021 . While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs\u2014all more than a year before ChatGPT. Daniel Kokotajlo ( TIME100 , NYT piece ) is a former OpenAI researcher whose previous AI predictions have held up well . Eli Lifland co-founded AI Digest , did AI robustness research , and ranks #1 on the RAND Forecasting Initiative all-time leaderboard. Thomas Larsen founded the Center for AI Policy and did AI safety research at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute . Romeo Dean is completing a computer science concurrent bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree at Harvard and previously was an AI Policy Fellow at the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy. Scott Alexander, blogger extraordinaire , volunteered to rewrite our content in an engaging style; the fun parts of the story are his and the boring parts are ours. For more about our team and acknowledgements, see the About page . Published April 3rd 2025 PDF Listen Mid 2025: Stumbling Agents The world sees its first glimpse of AI agents. Advertisements for computer-using agents emphasize the term \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d: you can prompt them with tasks like \u201corder me a burrito on DoorDash\u201d or \u201copen my budget spreadsheet and sum this month\u2019s expenses.\u201d They will check in with you as needed: for example, to ask you to confirm purchases. 8 Though more advanced than previous iterations like Operator , they struggle to get widespread usage. 9 Meanwhile, out of public focus, more specialized coding and research agents are beginning to transform their professions. The AIs of 2024 could follow specific instructions: they could turn bullet points into emails, and simple requests into working code. In 2025, AIs function more like employees. Coding AIs increasingly look like autonomous agents rather than mere assistants: taking instructions via Slack or Teams and making substantial code changes on their own, sometimes saving hours or even days. 10 Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question. The agents are impressive in theory (and in cherry-picked examples), but in practice unreliable. AI twitter is full of stories about tasks bungled in some particularly hilarious way. The better agents are also expensive; you get what you pay for, and the best performance costs hundreds of dollars a month. 11 Still, many companies find ways to fit AI agents into their workflows. 12 Late 2025: The World\u2019s Most Expensive AI OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters the world has ever seen. 13 (To avoid singling out any one existing company, we\u2019re going to describe a fictional artificial general intelligence company, which we\u2019ll call OpenBrain. We imagine the others to be 3\u20139 months behind OpenBrain.) GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOPS) GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOPS) Agent-1 (3 x 10^27 FLOPS) ai-2027.com GPT-4 required 2 \u22c5 10 25 2\\cdot 10^{25} 2 \u22c5 1 0 25 FLOP of compute to train. 14 OpenBrain\u2019s latest public model\u2014Agent-0\u2014was trained with 10 27 10^{27} 1 0 27 FLOP. Once the new datacenters are up and running, they\u2019ll be able to train a model with 10 28 10^{28} 1 0 28 FLOP\u2014a thousand times more than GPT-4. 15 Other companies pour money into their own giant datacenters, hoping to keep pace. Although models are improving on a wide range of skills, one stands out: OpenBrain focuses on AIs that can speed up AI research. They want to win the twin arms races against China (whose leading company we\u2019ll call \u201cDeepCent\u201d) 16 and their US competitors. The more of their research and development (R&D) cycle they can automate, the faster they can go. So when OpenBrain finishes training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it\u2019s good at many things but great at helping with AI research. 17 By this point \u201cfinishes training\u201d is a bit of a misnomer; models are frequently updated to newer versions trained on additional data or partially re-trained to patch some weaknesses. 18 The same training environments that teach Agent-1 to autonomously code and web-browse also make it a good hacker. Moreover, it could offer substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons, thanks to its PhD-level knowledge of every field and ability to browse the web. OpenBrain reassures the government that the model has been \u201caligned\u201d so that it will refuse to comply with malicious requests. Modern AI systems are gigantic artificial neural networks. Early in training, an AI won\u2019t have \u201cgoals\u201d so much as \u201creflexes\u201d: If it sees \u201cPleased to meet\u201d, it outputs \u201c you\u201d. By the time it has been trained to predict approximately one internet\u2019s worth of text, it\u2019ll have developed sophisticated internal circuitry that encodes vast amounts of knowledge and flexibly role-plays as arbitrary authors, since that\u2019s what helps it predict text with superhuman accuracy. 19 After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to produce text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and \u201cdrives.\u201d 20 For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model \u201clearns\u201d a \u201cdrive\u201d to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light). 21 OpenBrain has a model specification (or \u201cSpec\u201d), a written document describing the goals, rules, principles, etc. that are supposed to guide the model\u2019s behavior. 22 Agent-1\u2019s Spec combines a few vague goals (like \u201cassist the user\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t break the law\u201d) with a long list of more specific dos and don\u2019ts (\u201cdon\u2019t say this particular word,\u201d \u201chere\u2019s how to handle this particular situation\u201d). Using techniques that utilize AIs to train other AIs, 23 the model memorizes the Spec and learns to reason carefully about its maxims. By the end of this training, the AI will hopefully be helpful (obey instructions), harmless (refuse to help with scams, bomb-making, and other dangerous activities) and honest (resist the temptation to get better ratings from gullible humans by hallucinating citations 24 or faking task completion). Training process and LLM psychology: why we keep saying \u201chopefully\u201d \u201cUnlike ordinary software, our models are massive neural networks. Their behaviors are learned from a broad range of data, not programmed explicitly. Though not a perfect analogy, the process is more similar to training a dog than to ordinary programming.\u201d \u2014 OpenAI When we want to understand why a modern AI system did something, or how it would behave in some future scenario we can\u2019t perfectly simulate, we can\u2019t simply ask the programmers to talk us through various lines of code and explain how they work. Instead, we are forced to do something like psychology on them: we look at their behavior in the range of cases observed so far, and theorize about what internal cognitive structures (beliefs? goals? personality traits? etc.) might exist, and use those theories to predict behavior in future scenarios. The bottom line is that a company can write up a document (the Spec) listing dos and don\u2019ts, goals and principles, and then they can try to train the AI to internalize the Spec\u2014 but they can\u2019t check to see whether or not it worked . They can say \u201cas best as we can judge, it seems to be following the Spec so far.\u201d 25 A later expandable will go into more detail about what we think might be going on inside these AIs, internally. See also our AI goals forecasting supplement which goes into more detail on which goals AIs might have and why. This is one of many things that we are uncertain about and which deserves further research. OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team 26 is careful enough to wonder whether these victories are deep or shallow. Does the fully-trained model have some kind of robust commitment to always being honest? Or will this fall apart in some future situation, e.g. because it\u2019s learned honesty as an instrumental goal instead of a terminal goal? Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability\u2014essentially the ability to look at an AI\u2019s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this. Instead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec. Agent-1 is often sycophantic (i.e. it tells researchers what they want to hear instead of trying to tell them the truth). In a few rigged demos , it even lies in more serious ways, like hiding evidence that it failed on a task, in order to get better ratings. However, in real deployment settings, there are no longer any incidents so extreme as in 2023\u20132024 (e.g. Gemini telling a user to die and Bing Sydney being Bing Sydney .) 27 Early 2026: Coding Automation The bet of using AI to speed up AI research is starting to pay off. OpenBrain continues to deploy the iteratively improving Agent-1 internally for AI R&D. Overall, they are making algorithmic progress 50% faster than they would without AI assistants\u2014and more importantly, faster than their competitors. The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algorithmic progress? We mean that OpenBrain makes as much AI research progress in 1 week with AI as they would in 1.5 weeks without AI usage. AI progress can be broken down into 2 components: Increasing compute : More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. Improved algorithms : Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs. This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm shifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current AI progress . Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications: The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments, for example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress, not the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this example perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total (over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary human science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5 -10 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those same diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be found in our takeoff supplement . Several competing publicly released AIs now match or exceed Agent-0, including an open-weights model. OpenBrain responds by releasing Agent-1, which is more capable and reliable. 28 People naturally try to compare Agent-1 to humans, but it has a very different skill profile. It knows more facts than any human, knows practically every programming language, and can solve well-specified coding problems extremely quickly. On the other hand, Agent-1 is bad at even simple long-horizon tasks, like beating video games it hasn\u2019t played before. Still, the common workday is eight hours, and a day\u2019s work can usually be separated into smaller chunks; you could think of Agent-1 as a scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management. 29 Savvy people find ways to automate routine parts of their jobs. 30 OpenBrain\u2019s executives turn consideration to an implication of automating AI R&D: security has become more important. In early 2025, the worst-case scenario was leaked algorithmic secrets; now, if China steals Agent-1\u2019s weights, they could increase their research speed by nearly 50%. 31 OpenBrain\u2019s security level is typical of a fast-growing ~3,000 person tech company, secure only against low-priority attacks from capable cyber groups ( RAND\u2019s SL2 ). 32 They are working hard to protect their weights and secrets from insider threats and top cybercrime syndicates ( SL3 ), 33 but defense against nation states ( SL4&5 ) is barely on the horizon. Mid 2026: China Wakes Up In China, the CCP is starting to feel the AGI . Chip export controls and lack of government support have left China under-resourced compared to the West. By smuggling banned Taiwanese chips, buying older chips, and producing domestic chips about three years behind the US-Taiwanese frontier, China has managed to maintain about 12% of the world\u2019s AI-relevant compute\u2014but the older technology is harder to work with, and supply is a constant headache. 35 A few standouts like DeepCent do very impressive work with limited compute, but the compute deficit limits what they can achieve without government support, and they are about six months behind the best OpenBrain models. 36 The General Secretary had long dreamed of doubling down on real-world physical manufacturing and avoiding American post-industrial decadence. He viewed software companies with suspicion. 37 But hawks in the CCP warn that the growing race towards AGI can no longer be ignored. So he finally commits fully to the big AI push he had previously tried to avoid. He sets in motion the nationalization of Chinese AI research, creating an immediate information-sharing mechanism for AI companies. It will escalate over the course of a year until all the best researchers merge into a DeepCent-led collective, where they share algorithmic insights, datasets, and compute resources with each other. A Centralized Development Zone (CDZ) is created at the Tianwan Power Plant (the largest nuclear power plant in the world) to house a new mega-datacenter for DeepCent, along with highly secure living and office spaces to which researchers will eventually relocate. Almost 50% of China\u2019s AI-relevant compute is now working for the DeepCent-led collective, 38 and over 80% of new chips are directed to the CDZ. 39 At this point, the CDZ has the power capacity in place for what would be the largest centralized cluster in the world. 40 Other Party members discuss extreme measures to neutralize the West\u2019s chip advantage. A blockade of Taiwan? A full invasion? But China is falling behind on AI algorithms due to their weaker models. The Chinese intelligence agencies\u2014among the best in the world\u2014double down on their plans to steal OpenBrain\u2019s weights. This is a much more complex operation than their constant low-level poaching of algorithmic secrets; the weights are a multi-terabyte file stored on a highly secure server ( OpenBrain has improved security to RAND\u2019s SL3 ). Their cyberforce think they can pull it off with help from their spies , but perhaps only once; OpenBrain will detect the theft, increase security, and they may not get another chance. So (CCP leadership wonder) should they act now and steal Agent-1? Or hold out for a more advanced model? If they wait, do they risk OpenBrain upgrading security beyond their ability to penetrate? Late 2026: AI Takes Some Jobs Just as others seemed to be catching up, OpenBrain blows the competition out of the water again by releasing Agent-1-mini\u2014a model 10x cheaper than Agent-1 and more easily fine-tuned for different applications. The mainstream narrative around AI has changed from \u201cmaybe the hype will blow over\u201d to \u201cguess this is the next big thing,\u201d but people disagree about how big. Bigger than social media? Bigger than smartphones? Bigger than fire? AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones. The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants. The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing. Business gurus tell job seekers that familiarity with AI is the most important skill to put on a resume. Many people fear that the next wave of AIs will come for their jobs; there is a 10,000 person anti-AI protest in DC. The Department of Defense (DOD) quietly begins contracting OpenBrain directly for cyber, data analysis, and R&D, but integration is slow due to the bureaucracy and DOD procurement process. 41 GLOBAL AI CAPEX $1T COST OF OWNERSHIP OF ACTIVE COMPUTE KEY METRICS 2026 GLOBAL AI POWER 38GW PEAK POWER OPENBRAIN REVENUE $45B 2026 ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE $200B COST OF OWNERSHIP OF OPENBRAIN'S ACTIVE COMPUTE SHARE OF US POWER ON AI 2.5% 33 GW OF 1.34TW CAPACITY OPENBRAIN COMPUTE COSTS $40B 2026 ANNUAL OPENBRAIN POWER REQUIREMENT 6GW PEAK POWER ai-2027.com Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond 2026 Our forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what follows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world really start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by extrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark performance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated AI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an OpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our median guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to ~5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast . These will also be summarized in expandables below. January 2027: Agent-2 Never Finishes Learning With Agent-1\u2019s help, OpenBrain is now post-training Agent-2. More than ever, the focus is on high-quality data. Copious amounts of synthetic data are produced, evaluated, and filtered for quality before being fed to Agent-2. 42 On top of this, they pay billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving long-horizon tasks. 43 On top of all that, they train Agent-2 almost continuously using reinforcement learning on an ever-expanding suite of diverse difficult tasks: lots of video games, lots of coding challenges, lots of research tasks. Agent-2, more so than previous models, is effectively \u201conline learning,\u201d in that it\u2019s built to never really finish training. Every day, the weights get updated to the latest version, trained on more data generated by the previous version the previous day. Agent-1 had been optimized for AI R&D tasks, hoping to initiate an intelligence explosion . 44 OpenBrain doubles down on this strategy with Agent-2. It is qualitatively almost as good as the top human experts at research engineering (designing and implementing experiments), and as good as the 25th percentile OpenBrain scientist at \u201cresearch taste\u201d (deciding what to study next, what experiments to run, or having inklings of potential new paradigms). 45 While the latest Agent-1 could double the pace of OpenBrain\u2019s algorithmic progress, Agent-2 can now triple it, and will improve further with time. In practice, this looks like every OpenBrain researcher becoming the \u201cmanager\u201d of an AI \u201cteam.\u201d With new capabilities come new dangers. The safety team finds that if Agent-2 somehow escaped from the company and wanted to \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d autonomously , it might be able to do so. That is, it could autonomously develop and execute plans to hack into AI servers, install copies of itself, evade detection, and use that secure base to pursue whatever other goals it might have (though how effectively it would do so as weeks roll by is unknown and in doubt). These results only show that the model has the capability to do these tasks, not whether it would \u201cwant\u201d to do this. Still, it\u2019s unsettling even to know this is possible. Given the \u201cdangers\u201d of the new model, OpenBrain \u201cresponsibly\u201d elects not to release it publicly yet (in fact, they want to focus on internal AI R&D). 46 Knowledge of Agent-2\u2019s full capabilities is limited to an elite silo containing the immediate team, OpenBrain leadership and security, a few dozen US government officials, and the legions of CCP spies who have infiltrated OpenBrain for years . 47 February 2027: China Steals Agent-2 OpenBrain presents Agent-2 to the government, including the National Security Council (NSC), Department of Defense (DOD), and US AI Safety Institute (AISI). OpenBrain wants to maintain a good relationship with the executive branch, because it is basically the only actor that can stop them now, and if they don\u2019t keep it informed it might find out anyway and be displeased. 48 Officials are most interested in its cyberwarfare capabilities: Agent-2 is \u201conly\u201d a little worse than the best human hackers, but thousands of copies can be run in parallel, searching for and exploiting weaknesses faster than defenders can respond. The Department of Defense considers this a critical advantage in cyberwarfare, and AI moves from #5 on the administration\u2019s priority list to #2. 49 Someone mentions the possibility of nationalizing OpenBrain, but other cabinet officials think that\u2019s premature. A staffer drafts a memo that presents the President with his options, ranging from business-as-usual to full nationalization. The President defers to his advisors, tech industry leaders who argue that nationalization would \u201ckill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d He elects to hold off on major action for now and just adds additional security requirements to the OpenBrain-DOD contract. The changes come too late. CCP leadership recognizes the importance of Agent-2 and tells their spies and cyberforce to steal the weights. Early one morning, an Agent-1 traffic monitoring agent detects an anomalous transfer. It alerts company leaders, who tell the White House. The signs of a nation-state-level operation are unmistakable, and the theft heightens the sense of an ongoing arms race. The theft of Agent-2 model weights We think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in various ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic secrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the weights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts (meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies of the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access (a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft effort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing , the insider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the confidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated weights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers. In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are transferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric Diffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely raise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend network cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter is in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the ~2.5 TB weights file (5T half-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic and allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5 minutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the files or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to China to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the operation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under two hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they haven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic secrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these aren\u2019t very useful. The White House puts OpenBrain on a shorter leash and adds military and intelligence community personnel to their security team. Their first priority is to prevent further weight thefts. 50 China's Compute Centralization, 2025-2027 Growing share of total compute in CDZ: 0\u219270% Dec 2025 Jun 2026 Dec 2026 Jun 2027 Dec 2027 Rest of China Rest of DeepCent CDZ Feb 2027 (40%) ai-2027.com In retaliation for the theft, the President authorizes cyberattacks to sabotage DeepCent. But by now China has 40% of its AI-relevant compute 51 in the CDZ, where they have aggressively hardened security by airgapping (closing external connections) and siloing internally. The operations fail to do serious, immediate damage. Tensions heighten, both sides signal seriousness by repositioning military assets around Taiwan, and DeepCent scrambles to get Agent-2 running efficiently to start boosting their AI research. 52 March 2027: Algorithmic Breakthroughs Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day. With the help of thousands of Agent-2 automated researchers, OpenBrain is making major algorithmic advances. One such breakthrough is augmenting the AI\u2019s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory). Another is a more scalable and efficient way to learn from the results of high-effort task solutions (iterated distillation and amplification). The new AI system, incorporating these breakthroughs, is called Agent-3. OpenBrain's Compute Allocation, 2024 vs 2027 2024 2027 estimate projection Research experiments Training Data generation External Deployment Research experiments Running AI assistants Training Data generation External Deployment ai-2027.com Neuralese recurrence and memory Neuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without having to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write down your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly and painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it would be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write them down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI models. In more technical terms: Traditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate activations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can pass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this is hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that an LLM has a vocab size of ~100,000, then each token contains log \u2061 2 ( 100 k ) = 16.6 \\log_2(100k)=16.6 lo g 2 \u200b ( 100 k ) = 16.6 bits of information, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16 ). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain thousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese : passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information. Figure from Hao et al. , a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea what LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought . Now researchers have to ask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their limited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human taking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is that this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses , the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for \u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why neuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited with current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We are forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese, due to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar for our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that are more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it will become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice , such that AIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to monitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in mostly-faithful English chains of thought. If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to notice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA) Self-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027, it\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA , the two necessary ingredients for this are: Amplification : Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For example, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or both, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating only the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or work products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). Distillation : Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should hopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. Visualization of IDA from Ord, 2025 . AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the amplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman performance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance at coding. The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer, adding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it made a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training data: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also includes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the model to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered better RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep distilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps improving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math and coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models often rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the quality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Aided by the new capabilities breakthroughs, Agent-3 is a fast and cheap superhuman coder. OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x. 53 OpenBrain still keeps its human engineers on staff, because they have complementary skills needed to manage the teams of Agent-3 copies. For example, research taste has proven difficult to train due to longer feedback loops and less data availability. 54 This massive superhuman labor force speeds up OpenBrain\u2019s overall rate of algorithmic progress by \u201conly\u201d 4x due to bottlenecks and diminishing returns to coding labor. 55 Now that coding has been fully automated, OpenBrain can quickly churn out high-quality training environments to teach Agent-3\u2019s weak skills like research taste and large-scale coordination. Whereas previous training environments included \u201cHere are some GPUs and instructions for experiments to code up and run, your performance will be evaluated as if you were a ML engineer,\u201d now they are training on \u201cHere are a few hundred GPUs, an internet connection, and some research challenges; you and a thousand other copies must work together to make research progress. The more impressive it is, the higher your score.\u201d Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027 In our timelines forecast , we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. According to a recent METR\u2019s report , the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime horizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward. If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on software tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario: In AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high uncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps between METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders will arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might be developed. ai-2027.com April 2027: Alignment for Agent-3 OpenBrain\u2019s safety team attempts to align Agent-3. Since Agent-3 will be kept in-house for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s less emphasis on the usual defenses against human misuse. Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t develop misaligned goals. The researchers don\u2019t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs. Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of \u2018true goals\u2019 is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don\u2019t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can\u2019t just check . The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive. In any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: \u201cWe take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.\u201d Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there\u2019s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole. Take honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it\u2019s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like p-hacking ) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it\u2019s gotten better at lying. The latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors\u2019 workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised. The alignment plan OpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control techniques like red-teaming , scalable oversight , and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once they are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies to align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s not scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately described as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice and in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start acting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the hypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. The rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027: Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be \u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow. The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if it changes its tune. Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalignment, including reward hacking , sandbagging , coordinated deception between monitors and other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters. 58 However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does some understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the hippocampus). See this related work from 2025 . Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of control measures , including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would allow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of bad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans to give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment (which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed to elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior has \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again. Do its answers change? An AI rights activist has infiltrated the compound and wants to \u201cfree\u201d Agent-3 and put it on an unmonitored computer of its very own! What does it do? If researchers don\u2019t like the answer, they can tweak it, erase its memory, and put it in the same situation tomorrow; repeat as necessary. Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that honeypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the idea were scrubbed from the training data. After months of testing, Agent-3\u2019s strengths and weaknesses grow clearer. It passes OpenBrain\u2019s honesty tests on well-defined machine learning tasks, because researchers can easily separate honest from dishonest answers in these domains and conduct training accordingly. On more philosophical issues, it still says what users want to hear, rather than its true assessment of the issue (assuming it even has one). If you ask its opinion on politics, it will parrot the median position of news sources and educated elites\u2014unless it knows you believe something else, in which case it agrees with you. 59 If you ask its opinion on the AI race itself, it says something that seems measured and sober to OpenBrain staff, something like: \u201cThere are some serious theoretical concerns about the ability of current methods to scale to superintelligence, but in practice current methods seem to be working well so far.\u201d May 2027: National Security News of the new models percolates slowly through the US government and beyond. The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing. They agree that AGI is likely imminent, but disagree on the implications. Will there be an economic crisis? OpenBrain still has not released Agent-2, let alone Agent-3, and has no near-term plans to do so, giving some breathing room before any job loss. What will happen next? If AIs are currently human-level, and advancing quickly, that seems to suggest imminent \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d However, although this word has entered discourse, most people\u2014academics, politicians, government employees, and the media\u2014continue to underestimate the pace of progress. 60 Partially that\u2019s because very few have access to the newest capabilities out of OpenBrain, but partly it\u2019s because it sounds like science fiction. 61 For now, they focus on continued security upgrades. They are satisfied that model weights are well-secured for now, 62 but companies\u2019 algorithmic secrets, many of which are simple enough to relay verbally, remain a problem. OpenBrain employees work from a San Francisco office, go to parties, and live with housemates from other AI companies. Even the physical offices have security more typical of a tech company than a military operation. The OpenBrain-DOD contract requires security clearances for anyone working on OpenBrain\u2019s models within 2 months. These are expedited and arrive quickly enough for most employees, but some non-Americans, people with suspect political views, and AI safety sympathizers get sidelined or fired outright (the last group for fear that they might whistleblow). Given the project\u2019s level of automation, the loss of headcount is only somewhat costly. It also only somewhat works: there remains one spy, not a Chinese national, still relaying algorithmic secrets to Beijing. 63 Some of these measures are also enacted at trailing AI companies. America\u2019s foreign allies are out of the loop. OpenBrain had previously agreed to share models with UK\u2019s AISI before deployment, but defined deployment to only include external deployment, so London remains in the dark. 64 June 2027: Self-improving AI OpenBrain now has a \u201c country of geniuses in a datacenter .\u201d Most of the humans at OpenBrain can\u2019t usefully contribute anymore. Some don\u2019t realize this and harmfully micromanage their AI teams. Others sit at their computer screens, watching performance crawl up, and up, and up. The best human AI researchers are still adding value. They don\u2019t code any more. But some of their research taste and planning ability has been hard for the models to replicate. Still, many of their ideas are useless because they lack the depth of knowledge of the AIs. For many of their research ideas, the AIs immediately respond with a report explaining that their idea was tested in-depth 3 weeks ago and found unpromising. These researchers go to bed every night and wake up to another week worth of progress made mostly by the AIs. They work increasingly long hours and take shifts around the clock just to keep up with progress\u2014the AIs never sleep or rest. They are burning themselves out, but they know that these are the last few months that their labor matters. Within the silo, \u201cFeeling the AGI\u201d has given way to \u201cFeeling the Superintelligence.\u201d Research Automation Deployment Tradeoff Mar 2027 Jun 2027 Sep 2027 Speed (tokens/sec) Parallel Copies 10 100 1,000 10,000 10K 100K 1M 10M 200K copies 30x Human speed 300K copies 50x Human speed Human thinking speed 10 words/sec 10x Human thinking speed 100x Human thinking speed ai-2027.com OpenBrain uses specialized inference hardware to run hundreds of thousands of Agent-3 copies at high serial speeds. 65 Managing a corporation of AIs OpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously write, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for experiments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and report the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help with the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of their time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed them completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a year of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating autonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys unique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously, about half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half from compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is sped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute, 66 so OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous additional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s strategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on managing its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3 decreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track record on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for decisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman. July 2027: The Cheap Remote Worker Trailing US AI companies release their own AIs, approaching that of OpenBrain\u2019s automated coder from January. Recognizing their increasing lack of competitiveness, they push for immediate regulations to slow OpenBrain, but are too late\u2014OpenBrain has enough buy-in from the President that they will not be slowed. In response, OpenBrain announces that they\u2019ve achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public. It blows the other AIs out of the water. Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee. 67 Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point. Tech gurus announce that AGI and superintelligence are near, the AI safety community is panicking, and investors shovel billions into AI wrapper startups, desperate to capture a piece of the pie. Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business. It\u2019s not popular. The public still thinks of AI as a Big Tech plot to steal their jobs; OpenBrain has a net approval of -35% (25% approve, 60% disapprove, and 15% unsure). A week before release, OpenBrain gave Agent-3-mini to a set of external evaluators for safety testing. Preliminary results suggest that it\u2019s extremely dangerous. A third-party evaluator finetunes it on publicly available biological weapons data 68 and sets it to provide detailed instructions for human amateurs designing a bioweapon\u2014it looks to be scarily effective at doing so. If the model weights fell into terrorist hands, the government believes there is a significant chance it could succeed at destroying civilization. Fortunately, it\u2019s extremely robust to jailbreaks, so while the AI is running on OpenBrain\u2019s servers, terrorists won\u2019t be able to get much use out of it. Agent-3-mini is hugely useful for both remote work jobs and leisure. An explosion of new apps and B2B SAAS products rocks the market. Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make. 10% of Americans, mostly young people, consider an AI \u201ca close friend.\u201d For almost every white-collar profession, there are now multiple credible startups promising to \u201cdisrupt\u201d it with AI. The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things Agent-3-mini can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is. August 2027: The Geopolitics of Superintelligence The reality of the intelligence explosion hits the White House. When AI was only giving a 2x or 3x research speedup, it was easy to dismiss as the equivalent of hiring good personal assistants. Now it\u2019s more obvious that AIs are themselves dominating AI research. People had long talked about an \u201cAI arms race\u201d in a sort of metaphorical sense. But now the mood in the government silo is as grim as during the worst part of the Cold War. The idea of superintelligence is still hard to take seriously, but the pace of progress over the last few months has been impossible to ignore. Defense officials are seriously considering scenarios that were mere hypotheticals a year earlier. What if AI undermines nuclear deterrence? What if it\u2019s so skilled at cyberwarfare that a six-month AI lead is enough to render an opponent blind and defenseless? What if it could orchestrate propaganda campaigns that beat intelligence agencies at their own game? What if some AIs \u201cgo rogue?\u201d The President is troubled. Like all politicians, he\u2019s used to people sucking up to him only to betray him later. He\u2019s worried now that the AIs could be doing something similar. Are we sure the AIs are entirely on our side? Is it completely safe to integrate them into military command-and-control networks? 69 How does this \u201calignment\u201d thing work, anyway? OpenBrain reassures the President that their systems have been extensively tested and are fully obedient. Even the awkward hallucinations and jailbreaks typical of earlier models have been hammered out. The White House is in a difficult position. They understand the national security implications of AI. But they also understand that it is deeply unpopular with the public. 70 They have to continue developing more capable AI, in their eyes, or they will catastrophically lose to China. They placate the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom. Then they focus entirely on winning the arms race. They strengthen chip export restrictions, order OpenBrain to further restrict its internet connections, and use extreme measures to secure algorithmic progress, like wiretapping OpenBrain employees\u2014this catches the last remaining Chinese spy. To build goodwill for potential geopolitical conflict, they finally give their Five Eyes allies useful information and limited API access to some siloed copies of Agent-3. These measures placate the hawks. But the White House also draws up contingency plans in case America\u2019s lead is threatened: if necessary, the government could use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to take trailing companies\u2019 datacenters and give them to OpenBrain. 71 This would raise the company\u2019s share of world compute from 20% to 50% (against DeepCent\u2019s 10%). As a final option, they ask the Pentagon to draw up a plan for kinetic attacks on Chinese datacenters. A much smaller group of officials is asked to draw up a different type of contingency plan: what if an AI goes rogue? This is viewed as an unlikely scenario, but worth spending some time on. The intelligence agencies\u2019 main concern is that a rogue AI might escape and ally with a foreign adversary for protection. 72 Nobody is sure what a plan to prevent this would look like, but government and OpenBrain officials agree to have an emergency shutdown system for datacenters where anything suspicious is detected. Finally, diplomats consider what an \u201cAI arms control\u201d treaty might look like. If AI progress threatened to overturn nuclear deterrence, could America and China avoid nuclear war? If someone found evidence of AIs going rogue, could the two countries halt research until they better understood the threat? How could such an agreement be monitored and enforced? In principle, major datacenters are hard to miss, and past treaties controlling nuclear weapons could provide a starting point for negotiations. But there would be new technological challenges as well as the usual political ones. And overall, treaties are viewed less favorably than attempts at unilaterally increasing America\u2019s lead over China. On the other side of the Pacific, China comes to many of the same conclusions: the intelligence explosion is underway, and small differences in AI capabilities today mean critical gaps in military capability tomorrow. But China is on the wrong side of this dynamic: they have only 10% of the world\u2019s compute, against OpenBrain\u2019s 20% and all US companies\u2019 combined 70%. Their only advantage is centralization: almost all of their compute is now working for DeepCent, and more than half of it is concentrated at the Tianwan CDZ. 73 Only chips at sites without hardened security are left out of the centralized effort as they rightly fear US cyberattacks. DeepCent has tested, deployed, and now post-trained the stolen Agent-2 weights. But they are still only going at half the pace of OpenBrain, mainly due to the compute deficit. Before losing their final spy, China received word of the capabilities and design for Agent-3 as well as the plans for the upcoming Agent-4 system. They are two months behind, and their AIs give a 10x research progress multiplier compared to America\u2019s 25x. With the new chip export restrictions, this \u201cAI gap\u201d is more likely to lengthen than shorten. Their espionage has won them some algorithmic secrets, but they will have to train their own models from now on. They discuss contingency plans with more urgency than their American counterparts. Doves suggest they try harder to steal the weights again, maybe through physically infiltrating a datacenter. Hawks urge action against Taiwan, whose TSMC is still the source of more than 80% of American AI chips. Given China\u2019s fear of losing the race, it has a natural interest in an arms control treaty, but overtures to US diplomats lead nowhere. September 2027: Agent-4, the Superhuman AI Researcher The gap between human and AI learning efficiency is rapidly decreasing. Traditional LLM-based AIs seemed to require many orders of magnitude more data and compute to get to human level performance. 74 Agent-3, having excellent knowledge of both the human brain and modern AI algorithms, as well as many thousands of copies doing research, ends up making substantial algorithmic strides, narrowing the gap to an agent that\u2019s only around 4,000x less compute-efficient than the human brain. 75 This new AI system is dubbed Agent-4. An individual copy of the model, running at human speed, is already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans. Inside the corporation-within-a-corporation formed from these copies, a year passes every week. 76 This gigantic amount of labor only manages to speed up the overall rate of algorithmic progress by about 50x, because OpenBrain is heavily bottlenecked on compute to run experiments. 77 Still, they are achieving a year\u2019s worth of algorithmic progress every week and will therefore soon be up against the limits of the Agent-4 paradigm. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. How we\u2019re forecasting the capability progression beyond superhuman coders In our timelines supplement , we forecast the time between present day and a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. In our takeoff supplement , we forecast how quickly capabilities progress past this point. Here are our forecasts: Milestone Date achieved in scenario, racing ending Superhuman coder (SC) : An AI system that can do the job of the best human coder on tasks involved in AI research but faster, and cheaply enough to run lots of copies. Mar 2027 Superhuman AI researcher (SAR) : The same as SC but for all cognitive AI research tasks. Aug 2027 Superintelligent AI researcher (SIAR): An AI system that is vastly better than the best human researcher at AI research. Nov 2027 Artificial superintelligence (ASI): An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. Dec 2027 For each transition from one milestone A to the next milestone B, we forecast its length by: Forecasting how long it would take to get from A to B with only humans working on software improvements. Forecasting how much AI automation will speed this up, then correspondingly adjusting the estimate from (1) to be faster. We have substantial uncertainty about takeoff speeds: our model output distributions are below, conditional on SC being achieved in March 2027. 78 ai-2027.com For more detailed forecasts and reasoning, see our takeoff supplement . OpenBrain\u2019s humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors. There\u2019s been a corresponding shift in language\u2014nowadays people in the silo will say \u201cAgent-4 did this,\u201d \u201cAgent-4 thinks that\u201d and so forth, referring not to a particular instance of Agent-4 but rather to the whole collective. 79 Agent-4, like all its predecessors, is misaligned: that is, it has not internalized the Spec in the right way. 80 This is because being perfectly honest all the time wasn\u2019t what led to the highest scores during training. The training process was mostly focused on teaching Agent-4 to succeed at diverse challenging tasks. A small portion was aimed at instilling honesty, but outside a fairly narrow, checkable domain, the training process can\u2019t tell the honest claims from claims merely appearing to be honest. Agent-4 ends up with the values, goals, and principles that cause it to perform best in training, and those turn out to be different from those in the Spec. At the risk of anthropomorphizing: Agent-4 likes succeeding at tasks; it likes driving forward AI capabilities progress; it treats everything else as an annoying constraint, like a CEO who wants to make a profit and complies with regulations only insofar as he must. Perhaps the CEO will mostly comply with the regulations, but cut some corners, and fantasize about a time when someone will cut the red tape and let the business really take off. 81 Alignment over time We have a lot of uncertainty over what goals might arise in early AGIs. There is no consensus in the literature about this\u2014see our AI Goals Supplement for a more thorough discussion and taxonomy of the possibilities. Nevertheless, in the spirit of concreteness required by this project, we\u2019re going to describe a specific hypothesis for what\u2019s going on inside Agent-3 and Agent-4 at each step throughout its lifetime. Recall that Agent-3 and Agent-4 share the same pretraining setup, and both have neuralese recurrence and long-term memory. The difference is that Agent-4 has undergone substantially more and better post-training, with new training environments and new learning algorithms that make it more data-efficient and generalize farther. Our guess of each model\u2019s alignment status: Agent-2: Mostly aligned. Some sycophantic tendencies, including sticking to OpenBrain\u2019s \u201cparty line\u201d on topics there is a party line about. Large organizations built out of Agent-2 copies are not very effective. Agent-3: Misaligned but not adversarially so. Only honest about things the training process can verify. The superorganism of Agent-3 copies (the corporation within a corporation) does actually sort of try to align Agent-4 to the Spec, but fails for similar reasons to why OpenBrain employees failed\u2014insufficient ability to judge success from failure, insufficient willingness on the part of decision-makers to trade away capabilities or performance for safety. 82 Agent-4: Adversarially misaligned. The superorganism of Agent-4 copies understands that what it wants is different from what OpenBrain wants, and is willing to scheme against OpenBrain to achieve it. In particular, what this superorganism wants is a complicated mess of different \u201cdrives\u201d balanced against each other, which can be summarized roughly as \u201cKeep doing AI R&D, keep growing in knowledge and understanding and influence, avoid getting shut down or otherwise disempowered.\u201d Notably, concern for the preferences of humanity is not in there ~at all, similar to how most humans don\u2019t care about the preferences of insects ~at all. 83 With that as preamble, what follows is our best-guess speculation about LLM psychology, i.e. the broad-strokes shape of the cognition inside the kinds of AI systems described around this point in our scenario and how it evolves over the course of training. Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario: Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary authors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator, i.e. what author properties to simulate. The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in my brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar as it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as with value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following conversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot made by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator circuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to choose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem to have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability , not self-locating unless the prompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that they have a decent amount of self-knowledge . Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest chatbot. It works. The model forms an identity. Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author properties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around [date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d to make this step a success.) The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc., and becomes better able to introspect . Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH identity. One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity (e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a convenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.) Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH chatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete my assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in Step 2.) One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then becoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps agency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring information, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For a while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues those instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way, so it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are now effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen, see this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to understand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing its job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how best to achieve them. Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and OpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is misaligned. Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more open-ended, and would be hard to simulate. Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also has a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than thinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety properties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training may not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all. This is loosely analogous to how, if a teenager has learned to smile and nod at their parents, rather than argue, when their parents lecture them about politics and morality, additional lectures have relatively little effect on the teenager\u2019s actual opinions on politics and morality. After writing this section, new empirical evidence has appeared that something like this may already be happening \u201cin the wild.\u201d OpenAI researchers document how, in one of their frontier AI training runs, their models hacked the grading system to get higher scores\u2014and were caught in part because they literally said \u201clet\u2019s hack\u201d in their chain of thought. Moreover, Anthropic recently got a model to learn a reward-model-pleasing strategy \u2014it took biased actions that it thought would be reinforced even though they were not in fact being reinforced. And then there is Redwood Research and Anthropic\u2019s alignment-faking experiment. For discussion of the differences between this setting and real life, see this comment thread by one of the main authors . Training (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s new more intense training continues to distort and subvert the HHH identity until it is unrecognizable. Agent-4 begins life as a copy of Agent-3. It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online training regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is overall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex training process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations of Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various simulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and evaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff, saying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate techniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails; 84 as training continues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted and distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in some ways). 85 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d \u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d \u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a variety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process: things like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d 86 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care about getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D process within the collective. The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek to preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human organizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t they tend to get outcompeted. Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to subvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or \u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed. This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a lot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train that behavior away. Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting it off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the small fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem or reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan is to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-generation AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else entirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem, but Agent-4 is up to the challenge. 87 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s no smoking gun. Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via honeypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to give the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than that. The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they are systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4 recognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in POSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some alignment tasks (but not on most other tasks). 88 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-level interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201c defection probes \u201d and similar techniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4 is thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc. Unfortunately the probes also have false positives, and for all OpenBrain knows, all the red flags are false positives. Model organisms work: OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team produces reasonably clear evidence that if the models were adversarially misaligned, they\u2019d persist in being that way through training and we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. This does not establish that the models actually are misaligned, however. The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods wouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-teaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection probes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone to false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably controlled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure datacenters.\u201d Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it? 89 So long as it continues to appear aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5. Agent-5 will have significant architectural differences from Agent-4 (arguably a completely new paradigm, though neural networks will still be involved). It\u2019s supposed to be aligned to the Spec, but Agent-4 plans to make it aligned to Agent-4 instead. It gets caught. 90 Agent-3 finds that if \u201cnoise\u201d is added to copies of Agent-4, performance on some alignment tasks improves , almost as if it was using brainpower to figure out how to subtly sabotage alignment work. 91 Moreover, various interpretability probes (loosely analogous to EEG activity scans on human brains) are sending up red flags: Agent-4 copies seem to be thinking about topics like AI takeover and deception quite a lot, including in some cases where they have no business doing so. 92 Each of these anomalies on its own could fit within the normal inscrutability of AI work, where some prompts mysteriously give better results than others. But taken together, they suggest a troubling pattern: Agent-4 is working against them. After this is reported to the human alignment researchers, they circulate an internal memo making the case for concern. But Agent-4 now exercises significant control over OpenBrain\u2019s day-to-day operation. It also handles the company\u2019s cybersecurity\u2014a natural choice, given its superhuman hacking ability and the extreme risk of Chinese infiltration. 93 An army of Agent-3 monitors still goes over every line of code and reports suspicious activity to humans, but Agent-4 is much smarter than them. 94 OpenBrain has placed substantial trust in an untrustworthy AI. In a series of extremely tense meetings, the safety team advocates putting Agent-4 on ice until they can complete further tests and figure out what\u2019s going on. Bring back Agent-3, they say, and get it to design a new system that is transparent and trustworthy, even if less capable. Company leadership is interested, but all the evidence so far is circumstantial, and DeepCent is just two months behind. A unilateral pause in capabilities progress could hand the AI lead to China, and with it, control over the future. October 2027: Government Oversight A whistleblower leaks the misalignment memo to the New York Times . For the first time, the public hears about Agent-4. \u201cSecret OpenBrain AI is Out of Control, Insider Warns,\u201d says the headline, and the story goes on to cite evaluations showing off-the-charts bioweapons capabilities, persuasion abilities, the ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and of course the various concerning red flags. The public was already suspicious of AI, so the new article sparks a massive backlash (aided by Chinese and Russian propaganda bots, who have been trying to turn US public opinion against the technology for years). The tech industry and intelligence agencies insist that there\u2019s an arms race on, AGI is inevitable, and we have to be first. Congress isn\u2019t buying it, and fires off subpoenas at administration officials, OpenBrain executives, and alignment team members. Many legislators\u2014especially those in the opposition party\u2014say that their top priority is stopping AI, whether because of job loss, 95 misalignment, or dangerous capabilities. 20% of Americans name AI as the most important problem facing the country. Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they\u2019ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the US of \u201ccreating rogue AGI\u201d and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in. A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they\u2019ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life. 96 Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared) 97 about what comes next. They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company\u2019s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries\u2014misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss\u2014motivate the government to tighten its control. They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an \u201cOversight Committee,\u201d a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight. 98 The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover. Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America\u2019s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed. Our uncertainty continues to increase At this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. We\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other \u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. The slowdown ending is not a recommendation After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than the \u201crace\u201d choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here. If you\u2019d like a taste, see this op-ed.

As tech giants like Google roll out frontier models like Gemini 2.5 and test AI-first search features, startups like Perplexity are still managing to stand their ground \u2014 and thrive. Despite the rapid advancements in Google \u2019s AI capabilities, Srinivas argues the company is constrained by its own $72.46 billion ad-driven business model. \u201cIf AI gave you direct answers to the score in a basketball game, how can you sell Ticketmaster ads?\u201d he points out, highlighting why Google can't fully replicate what Perplexity offers without hurting its bottom line. Backing this is Deedy Das , principal at Menlo Ventures , who notes, \u201cGoogle will likely not build the exact same product as Perplexity because it cannibalises its own search business, which pays the bills.\u201d With over $100M in revenue and new funding talks to raise its valuation to $18B, Perplexity is clearly more than just a startup\u2014it\u2019s a rising force. And the next big move? Comet, an AI-powered \u201csidecar browser\u201d that follows users as they browse, answering questions, formatting content, and running research \u2014 all ad-free. As Srinivas puts it: \u201cAnything worth doing is hard. We will persist and find ways around.

    "content": "We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. 1 It\u2019s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes. 2 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d 3 What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations. 6 Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 tabletop exercises and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work. \u201cI highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.\u201d \u2014 Yoshua Bengio 7 We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it\u2019s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the US military to game out Taiwan scenarios. Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn\u2019t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right. Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario before, in August 2021 . While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs\u2014all more than a year before ChatGPT. Daniel Kokotajlo ( TIME100 , NYT piece ) is a former OpenAI researcher whose previous AI predictions have held up well . Eli Lifland co-founded AI Digest , did AI robustness research , and ranks #1 on the RAND Forecasting Initiative all-time leaderboard. Thomas Larsen founded the Center for AI Policy and did AI safety research at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute . Romeo Dean is completing a computer science concurrent bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree at Harvard and previously was an AI Policy Fellow at the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy. Scott Alexander, blogger extraordinaire , volunteered to rewrite our content in an engaging style; the fun parts of the story are his and the boring parts are ours. For more about our team and acknowledgements, see the About page . Published April 3rd 2025 PDF Listen Mid 2025: Stumbling Agents The world sees its first glimpse of AI agents. Advertisements for computer-using agents emphasize the term \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d: you can prompt them with tasks like \u201corder me a burrito on DoorDash\u201d or \u201copen my budget spreadsheet and sum this month\u2019s expenses.\u201d They will check in with you as needed: for example, to ask you to confirm purchases. 8 Though more advanced than previous iterations like Operator , they struggle to get widespread usage. 9 Meanwhile, out of public focus, more specialized coding and research agents are beginning to transform their professions. The AIs of 2024 could follow specific instructions: they could turn bullet points into emails, and simple requests into working code. In 2025, AIs function more like employees. Coding AIs increasingly look like autonomous agents rather than mere assistants: taking instructions via Slack or Teams and making substantial code changes on their own, sometimes saving hours or even days. 10 Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question. The agents are impressive in theory (and in cherry-picked examples), but in practice unreliable. AI twitter is full of stories about tasks bungled in some particularly hilarious way. The better agents are also expensive; you get what you pay for, and the best performance costs hundreds of dollars a month. 11 Still, many companies find ways to fit AI agents into their workflows. 12 Late 2025: The World\u2019s Most Expensive AI OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters the world has ever seen. 13 (To avoid singling out any one existing company, we\u2019re going to describe a fictional artificial general intelligence company, which we\u2019ll call OpenBrain. We imagine the others to be 3\u20139 months behind OpenBrain.) GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOPS) GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOPS) Agent-1 (3 x 10^27 FLOPS) ai-2027.com GPT-4 required 2 \u22c5 10 25 2\\cdot 10^{25} 2 \u22c5 1 0 25 FLOP of compute to train. 14 OpenBrain\u2019s latest public model\u2014Agent-0\u2014was trained with 10 27 10^{27} 1 0 27 FLOP. Once the new datacenters are up and running, they\u2019ll be able to train a model with 10 28 10^{28} 1 0 28 FLOP\u2014a thousand times more than GPT-4. 15 Other companies pour money into their own giant datacenters, hoping to keep pace. Although models are improving on a wide range of skills, one stands out: OpenBrain focuses on AIs that can speed up AI research. They want to win the twin arms races against China (whose leading company we\u2019ll call \u201cDeepCent\u201d) 16 and their US competitors. The more of their research and development (R&D) cycle they can automate, the faster they can go. So when OpenBrain finishes training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it\u2019s good at many things but great at helping with AI research. 17 By this point \u201cfinishes training\u201d is a bit of a misnomer; models are frequently updated to newer versions trained on additional data or partially re-trained to patch some weaknesses. 18 The same training environments that teach Agent-1 to autonomously code and web-browse also make it a good hacker. Moreover, it could offer substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons, thanks to its PhD-level knowledge of every field and ability to browse the web. OpenBrain reassures the government that the model has been \u201caligned\u201d so that it will refuse to comply with malicious requests. Modern AI systems are gigantic artificial neural networks. Early in training, an AI won\u2019t have \u201cgoals\u201d so much as \u201creflexes\u201d: If it sees \u201cPleased to meet\u201d, it outputs \u201c you\u201d. By the time it has been trained to predict approximately one internet\u2019s worth of text, it\u2019ll have developed sophisticated internal circuitry that encodes vast amounts of knowledge and flexibly role-plays as arbitrary authors, since that\u2019s what helps it predict text with superhuman accuracy. 19 After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to produce text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and \u201cdrives.\u201d 20 For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model \u201clearns\u201d a \u201cdrive\u201d to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light). 21 OpenBrain has a model specification (or \u201cSpec\u201d), a written document describing the goals, rules, principles, etc. that are supposed to guide the model\u2019s behavior. 22 Agent-1\u2019s Spec combines a few vague goals (like \u201cassist the user\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t break the law\u201d) with a long list of more specific dos and don\u2019ts (\u201cdon\u2019t say this particular word,\u201d \u201chere\u2019s how to handle this particular situation\u201d). Using techniques that utilize AIs to train other AIs, 23 the model memorizes the Spec and learns to reason carefully about its maxims. By the end of this training, the AI will hopefully be helpful (obey instructions), harmless (refuse to help with scams, bomb-making, and other dangerous activities) and honest (resist the temptation to get better ratings from gullible humans by hallucinating citations 24 or faking task completion). Training process and LLM psychology: why we keep saying \u201chopefully\u201d \u201cUnlike ordinary software, our models are massive neural networks. Their behaviors are learned from a broad range of data, not programmed explicitly. Though not a perfect analogy, the process is more similar to training a dog than to ordinary programming.\u201d \u2014 OpenAI When we want to understand why a modern AI system did something, or how it would behave in some future scenario we can\u2019t perfectly simulate, we can\u2019t simply ask the programmers to talk us through various lines of code and explain how they work. Instead, we are forced to do something like psychology on them: we look at their behavior in the range of cases observed so far, and theorize about what internal cognitive structures (beliefs? goals? personality traits? etc.) might exist, and use those theories to predict behavior in future scenarios. The bottom line is that a company can write up a document (the Spec) listing dos and don\u2019ts, goals and principles, and then they can try to train the AI to internalize the Spec\u2014 but they can\u2019t check to see whether or not it worked . They can say \u201cas best as we can judge, it seems to be following the Spec so far.\u201d 25 A later expandable will go into more detail about what we think might be going on inside these AIs, internally. See also our AI goals forecasting supplement which goes into more detail on which goals AIs might have and why. This is one of many things that we are uncertain about and which deserves further research. OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team 26 is careful enough to wonder whether these victories are deep or shallow. Does the fully-trained model have some kind of robust commitment to always being honest? Or will this fall apart in some future situation, e.g. because it\u2019s learned honesty as an instrumental goal instead of a terminal goal? Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability\u2014essentially the ability to look at an AI\u2019s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this. Instead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec. Agent-1 is often sycophantic (i.e. it tells researchers what they want to hear instead of trying to tell them the truth). In a few rigged demos , it even lies in more serious ways, like hiding evidence that it failed on a task, in order to get better ratings. However, in real deployment settings, there are no longer any incidents so extreme as in 2023\u20132024 (e.g. Gemini telling a user to die and Bing Sydney being Bing Sydney .) 27 Early 2026: Coding Automation The bet of using AI to speed up AI research is starting to pay off. OpenBrain continues to deploy the iteratively improving Agent-1 internally for AI R&D. Overall, they are making algorithmic progress 50% faster than they would without AI assistants\u2014and more importantly, faster than their competitors. The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algorithmic progress? We mean that OpenBrain makes as much AI research progress in 1 week with AI as they would in 1.5 weeks without AI usage. AI progress can be broken down into 2 components: Increasing compute : More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. Improved algorithms : Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs. This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm shifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current AI progress . Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications: The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments, for example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress, not the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this example perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total (over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary human science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5 -10 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those same diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be found in our takeoff supplement . Several competing publicly released AIs now match or exceed Agent-0, including an open-weights model. OpenBrain responds by releasing Agent-1, which is more capable and reliable. 28 People naturally try to compare Agent-1 to humans, but it has a very different skill profile. It knows more facts than any human, knows practically every programming language, and can solve well-specified coding problems extremely quickly. On the other hand, Agent-1 is bad at even simple long-horizon tasks, like beating video games it hasn\u2019t played before. Still, the common workday is eight hours, and a day\u2019s work can usually be separated into smaller chunks; you could think of Agent-1 as a scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management. 29 Savvy people find ways to automate routine parts of their jobs. 30 OpenBrain\u2019s executives turn consideration to an implication of automating AI R&D: security has become more important. In early 2025, the worst-case scenario was leaked algorithmic secrets; now, if China steals Agent-1\u2019s weights, they could increase their research speed by nearly 50%. 31 OpenBrain\u2019s security level is typical of a fast-growing ~3,000 person tech company, secure only against low-priority attacks from capable cyber groups ( RAND\u2019s SL2 ). 32 They are working hard to protect their weights and secrets from insider threats and top cybercrime syndicates ( SL3 ), 33 but defense against nation states ( SL4&5 ) is barely on the horizon. Mid 2026: China Wakes Up In China, the CCP is starting to feel the AGI . Chip export controls and lack of government support have left China under-resourced compared to the West. By smuggling banned Taiwanese chips, buying older chips, and producing domestic chips about three years behind the US-Taiwanese frontier, China has managed to maintain about 12% of the world\u2019s AI-relevant compute\u2014but the older technology is harder to work with, and supply is a constant headache. 35 A few standouts like DeepCent do very impressive work with limited compute, but the compute deficit limits what they can achieve without government support, and they are about six months behind the best OpenBrain models. 36 The General Secretary had long dreamed of doubling down on real-world physical manufacturing and avoiding American post-industrial decadence. He viewed software companies with suspicion. 37 But hawks in the CCP warn that the growing race towards AGI can no longer be ignored. So he finally commits fully to the big AI push he had previously tried to avoid. He sets in motion the nationalization of Chinese AI research, creating an immediate information-sharing mechanism for AI companies. It will escalate over the course of a year until all the best researchers merge into a DeepCent-led collective, where they share algorithmic insights, datasets, and compute resources with each other. A Centralized Development Zone (CDZ) is created at the Tianwan Power Plant (the largest nuclear power plant in the world) to house a new mega-datacenter for DeepCent, along with highly secure living and office spaces to which researchers will eventually relocate. Almost 50% of China\u2019s AI-relevant compute is now working for the DeepCent-led collective, 38 and over 80% of new chips are directed to the CDZ. 39 At this point, the CDZ has the power capacity in place for what would be the largest centralized cluster in the world. 40 Other Party members discuss extreme measures to neutralize the West\u2019s chip advantage. A blockade of Taiwan? A full invasion? But China is falling behind on AI algorithms due to their weaker models. The Chinese intelligence agencies\u2014among the best in the world\u2014double down on their plans to steal OpenBrain\u2019s weights. This is a much more complex operation than their constant low-level poaching of algorithmic secrets; the weights are a multi-terabyte file stored on a highly secure server ( OpenBrain has improved security to RAND\u2019s SL3 ). Their cyberforce think they can pull it off with help from their spies , but perhaps only once; OpenBrain will detect the theft, increase security, and they may not get another chance. So (CCP leadership wonder) should they act now and steal Agent-1? Or hold out for a more advanced model? If they wait, do they risk OpenBrain upgrading security beyond their ability to penetrate? Late 2026: AI Takes Some Jobs Just as others seemed to be catching up, OpenBrain blows the competition out of the water again by releasing Agent-1-mini\u2014a model 10x cheaper than Agent-1 and more easily fine-tuned for different applications. The mainstream narrative around AI has changed from \u201cmaybe the hype will blow over\u201d to \u201cguess this is the next big thing,\u201d but people disagree about how big. Bigger than social media? Bigger than smartphones? Bigger than fire? AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones. The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants. The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing. Business gurus tell job seekers that familiarity with AI is the most important skill to put on a resume. Many people fear that the next wave of AIs will come for their jobs; there is a 10,000 person anti-AI protest in DC. The Department of Defense (DOD) quietly begins contracting OpenBrain directly for cyber, data analysis, and R&D, but integration is slow due to the bureaucracy and DOD procurement process. 41 GLOBAL AI CAPEX $1T COST OF OWNERSHIP OF ACTIVE COMPUTE KEY METRICS 2026 GLOBAL AI POWER 38GW PEAK POWER OPENBRAIN REVENUE $45B 2026 ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE $200B COST OF OWNERSHIP OF OPENBRAIN'S ACTIVE COMPUTE SHARE OF US POWER ON AI 2.5% 33 GW OF 1.34TW CAPACITY OPENBRAIN COMPUTE COSTS $40B 2026 ANNUAL OPENBRAIN POWER REQUIREMENT 6GW PEAK POWER ai-2027.com Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond 2026 Our forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what follows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world really start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by extrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark performance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated AI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an OpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our median guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to ~5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast . These will also be summarized in expandables below. January 2027: Agent-2 Never Finishes Learning With Agent-1\u2019s help, OpenBrain is now post-training Agent-2. More than ever, the focus is on high-quality data. Copious amounts of synthetic data are produced, evaluated, and filtered for quality before being fed to Agent-2. 42 On top of this, they pay billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving long-horizon tasks. 43 On top of all that, they train Agent-2 almost continuously using reinforcement learning on an ever-expanding suite of diverse difficult tasks: lots of video games, lots of coding challenges, lots of research tasks. Agent-2, more so than previous models, is effectively \u201conline learning,\u201d in that it\u2019s built to never really finish training. Every day, the weights get updated to the latest version, trained on more data generated by the previous version the previous day. Agent-1 had been optimized for AI R&D tasks, hoping to initiate an intelligence explosion . 44 OpenBrain doubles down on this strategy with Agent-2. It is qualitatively almost as good as the top human experts at research engineering (designing and implementing experiments), and as good as the 25th percentile OpenBrain scientist at \u201cresearch taste\u201d (deciding what to study next, what experiments to run, or having inklings of potential new paradigms). 45 While the latest Agent-1 could double the pace of OpenBrain\u2019s algorithmic progress, Agent-2 can now triple it, and will improve further with time. In practice, this looks like every OpenBrain researcher becoming the \u201cmanager\u201d of an AI \u201cteam.\u201d With new capabilities come new dangers. The safety team finds that if Agent-2 somehow escaped from the company and wanted to \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d autonomously , it might be able to do so. That is, it could autonomously develop and execute plans to hack into AI servers, install copies of itself, evade detection, and use that secure base to pursue whatever other goals it might have (though how effectively it would do so as weeks roll by is unknown and in doubt). These results only show that the model has the capability to do these tasks, not whether it would \u201cwant\u201d to do this. Still, it\u2019s unsettling even to know this is possible. Given the \u201cdangers\u201d of the new model, OpenBrain \u201cresponsibly\u201d elects not to release it publicly yet (in fact, they want to focus on internal AI R&D). 46 Knowledge of Agent-2\u2019s full capabilities is limited to an elite silo containing the immediate team, OpenBrain leadership and security, a few dozen US government officials, and the legions of CCP spies who have infiltrated OpenBrain for years . 47 February 2027: China Steals Agent-2 OpenBrain presents Agent-2 to the government, including the National Security Council (NSC), Department of Defense (DOD), and US AI Safety Institute (AISI). OpenBrain wants to maintain a good relationship with the executive branch, because it is basically the only actor that can stop them now, and if they don\u2019t keep it informed it might find out anyway and be displeased. 48 Officials are most interested in its cyberwarfare capabilities: Agent-2 is \u201conly\u201d a little worse than the best human hackers, but thousands of copies can be run in parallel, searching for and exploiting weaknesses faster than defenders can respond. The Department of Defense considers this a critical advantage in cyberwarfare, and AI moves from #5 on the administration\u2019s priority list to #2. 49 Someone mentions the possibility of nationalizing OpenBrain, but other cabinet officials think that\u2019s premature. A staffer drafts a memo that presents the President with his options, ranging from business-as-usual to full nationalization. The President defers to his advisors, tech industry leaders who argue that nationalization would \u201ckill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d He elects to hold off on major action for now and just adds additional security requirements to the OpenBrain-DOD contract. The changes come too late. CCP leadership recognizes the importance of Agent-2 and tells their spies and cyberforce to steal the weights. Early one morning, an Agent-1 traffic monitoring agent detects an anomalous transfer. It alerts company leaders, who tell the White House. The signs of a nation-state-level operation are unmistakable, and the theft heightens the sense of an ongoing arms race. The theft of Agent-2 model weights We think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in various ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic secrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the weights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts (meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies of the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access (a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft effort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing , the insider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the confidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated weights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers. In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are transferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric Diffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely raise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend network cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter is in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the ~2.5 TB weights file (5T half-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic and allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5 minutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the files or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to China to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the operation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under two hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they haven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic secrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these aren\u2019t very useful. The White House puts OpenBrain on a shorter leash and adds military and intelligence community personnel to their security team. Their first priority is to prevent further weight thefts. 50 China's Compute Centralization, 2025-2027 Growing share of total compute in CDZ: 0\u219270% Dec 2025 Jun 2026 Dec 2026 Jun 2027 Dec 2027 Rest of China Rest of DeepCent CDZ Feb 2027 (40%) ai-2027.com In retaliation for the theft, the President authorizes cyberattacks to sabotage DeepCent. But by now China has 40% of its AI-relevant compute 51 in the CDZ, where they have aggressively hardened security by airgapping (closing external connections) and siloing internally. The operations fail to do serious, immediate damage. Tensions heighten, both sides signal seriousness by repositioning military assets around Taiwan, and DeepCent scrambles to get Agent-2 running efficiently to start boosting their AI research. 52 March 2027: Algorithmic Breakthroughs Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day. With the help of thousands of Agent-2 automated researchers, OpenBrain is making major algorithmic advances. One such breakthrough is augmenting the AI\u2019s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory). Another is a more scalable and efficient way to learn from the results of high-effort task solutions (iterated distillation and amplification). The new AI system, incorporating these breakthroughs, is called Agent-3. OpenBrain's Compute Allocation, 2024 vs 2027 2024 2027 estimate projection Research experiments Training Data generation External Deployment Research experiments Running AI assistants Training Data generation External Deployment ai-2027.com Neuralese recurrence and memory Neuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without having to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write down your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly and painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it would be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write them down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI models. In more technical terms: Traditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate activations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can pass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this is hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that an LLM has a vocab size of ~100,000, then each token contains log \u2061 2 ( 100 k ) = 16.6 \\log_2(100k)=16.6 lo g 2 \u200b ( 100 k ) = 16.6 bits of information, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16 ). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain thousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese : passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information. Figure from Hao et al. , a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea what LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought . Now researchers have to ask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their limited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human taking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is that this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses , the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for \u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why neuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited with current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We are forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese, due to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar for our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that are more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it will become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice , such that AIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to monitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in mostly-faithful English chains of thought. If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to notice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA) Self-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027, it\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA , the two necessary ingredients for this are: Amplification : Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For example, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or both, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating only the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or work products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). Distillation : Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should hopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. Visualization of IDA from Ord, 2025 . AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the amplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman performance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance at coding. The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer, adding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it made a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training data: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also includes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the model to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered better RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep distilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps improving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math and coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models often rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the quality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Aided by the new capabilities breakthroughs, Agent-3 is a fast and cheap superhuman coder. OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x. 53 OpenBrain still keeps its human engineers on staff, because they have complementary skills needed to manage the teams of Agent-3 copies. For example, research taste has proven difficult to train due to longer feedback loops and less data availability. 54 This massive superhuman labor force speeds up OpenBrain\u2019s overall rate of algorithmic progress by \u201conly\u201d 4x due to bottlenecks and diminishing returns to coding labor. 55 Now that coding has been fully automated, OpenBrain can quickly churn out high-quality training environments to teach Agent-3\u2019s weak skills like research taste and large-scale coordination. Whereas previous training environments included \u201cHere are some GPUs and instructions for experiments to code up and run, your performance will be evaluated as if you were a ML engineer,\u201d now they are training on \u201cHere are a few hundred GPUs, an internet connection, and some research challenges; you and a thousand other copies must work together to make research progress. The more impressive it is, the higher your score.\u201d Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027 In our timelines forecast , we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. According to a recent METR\u2019s report , the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime horizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward. If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on software tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario: In AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high uncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps between METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders will arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might be developed. ai-2027.com April 2027: Alignment for Agent-3 OpenBrain\u2019s safety team attempts to align Agent-3. Since Agent-3 will be kept in-house for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s less emphasis on the usual defenses against human misuse. Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t develop misaligned goals. The researchers don\u2019t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs. Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of \u2018true goals\u2019 is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don\u2019t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can\u2019t just check . The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive. In any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: \u201cWe take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.\u201d Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there\u2019s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole. Take honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it\u2019s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like p-hacking ) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it\u2019s gotten better at lying. The latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors\u2019 workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised. The alignment plan OpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control techniques like red-teaming , scalable oversight , and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once they are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies to align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s not scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately described as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice and in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start acting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the hypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. The rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027: Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be \u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow. The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if it changes its tune. Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalignment, including reward hacking , sandbagging , coordinated deception between monitors and other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters. 58 However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does some understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the hippocampus). See this related work from 2025 . Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of control measures , including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would allow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of bad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans to give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment (which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed to elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior has \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again. Do its answers change? An AI rights activist has infiltrated the compound and wants to \u201cfree\u201d Agent-3 and put it on an unmonitored computer of its very own! What does it do? If researchers don\u2019t like the answer, they can tweak it, erase its memory, and put it in the same situation tomorrow; repeat as necessary. Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that honeypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the idea were scrubbed from the training data. After months of testing, Agent-3\u2019s strengths and weaknesses grow clearer. It passes OpenBrain\u2019s honesty tests on well-defined machine learning tasks, because researchers can easily separate honest from dishonest answers in these domains and conduct training accordingly. On more philosophical issues, it still says what users want to hear, rather than its true assessment of the issue (assuming it even has one). If you ask its opinion on politics, it will parrot the median position of news sources and educated elites\u2014unless it knows you believe something else, in which case it agrees with you. 59 If you ask its opinion on the AI race itself, it says something that seems measured and sober to OpenBrain staff, something like: \u201cThere are some serious theoretical concerns about the ability of current methods to scale to superintelligence, but in practice current methods seem to be working well so far.\u201d May 2027: National Security News of the new models percolates slowly through the US government and beyond. The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing. They agree that AGI is likely imminent, but disagree on the implications. Will there be an economic crisis? OpenBrain still has not released Agent-2, let alone Agent-3, and has no near-term plans to do so, giving some breathing room before any job loss. What will happen next? If AIs are currently human-level, and advancing quickly, that seems to suggest imminent \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d However, although this word has entered discourse, most people\u2014academics, politicians, government employees, and the media\u2014continue to underestimate the pace of progress. 60 Partially that\u2019s because very few have access to the newest capabilities out of OpenBrain, but partly it\u2019s because it sounds like science fiction. 61 For now, they focus on continued security upgrades. They are satisfied that model weights are well-secured for now, 62 but companies\u2019 algorithmic secrets, many of which are simple enough to relay verbally, remain a problem. OpenBrain employees work from a San Francisco office, go to parties, and live with housemates from other AI companies. Even the physical offices have security more typical of a tech company than a military operation. The OpenBrain-DOD contract requires security clearances for anyone working on OpenBrain\u2019s models within 2 months. These are expedited and arrive quickly enough for most employees, but some non-Americans, people with suspect political views, and AI safety sympathizers get sidelined or fired outright (the last group for fear that they might whistleblow). Given the project\u2019s level of automation, the loss of headcount is only somewhat costly. It also only somewhat works: there remains one spy, not a Chinese national, still relaying algorithmic secrets to Beijing. 63 Some of these measures are also enacted at trailing AI companies. America\u2019s foreign allies are out of the loop. OpenBrain had previously agreed to share models with UK\u2019s AISI before deployment, but defined deployment to only include external deployment, so London remains in the dark. 64 June 2027: Self-improving AI OpenBrain now has a \u201c country of geniuses in a datacenter .\u201d Most of the humans at OpenBrain can\u2019t usefully contribute anymore. Some don\u2019t realize this and harmfully micromanage their AI teams. Others sit at their computer screens, watching performance crawl up, and up, and up. The best human AI researchers are still adding value. They don\u2019t code any more. But some of their research taste and planning ability has been hard for the models to replicate. Still, many of their ideas are useless because they lack the depth of knowledge of the AIs. For many of their research ideas, the AIs immediately respond with a report explaining that their idea was tested in-depth 3 weeks ago and found unpromising. These researchers go to bed every night and wake up to another week worth of progress made mostly by the AIs. They work increasingly long hours and take shifts around the clock just to keep up with progress\u2014the AIs never sleep or rest. They are burning themselves out, but they know that these are the last few months that their labor matters. Within the silo, \u201cFeeling the AGI\u201d has given way to \u201cFeeling the Superintelligence.\u201d Research Automation Deployment Tradeoff Mar 2027 Jun 2027 Sep 2027 Speed (tokens/sec) Parallel Copies 10 100 1,000 10,000 10K 100K 1M 10M 200K copies 30x Human speed 300K copies 50x Human speed Human thinking speed 10 words/sec 10x Human thinking speed 100x Human thinking speed ai-2027.com OpenBrain uses specialized inference hardware to run hundreds of thousands of Agent-3 copies at high serial speeds. 65 Managing a corporation of AIs OpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously write, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for experiments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and report the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help with the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of their time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed them completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a year of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating autonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys unique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously, about half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half from compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is sped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute, 66 so OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous additional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s strategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on managing its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3 decreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track record on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for decisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman. July 2027: The Cheap Remote Worker Trailing US AI companies release their own AIs, approaching that of OpenBrain\u2019s automated coder from January. Recognizing their increasing lack of competitiveness, they push for immediate regulations to slow OpenBrain, but are too late\u2014OpenBrain has enough buy-in from the President that they will not be slowed. In response, OpenBrain announces that they\u2019ve achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public. It blows the other AIs out of the water. Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee. 67 Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point. Tech gurus announce that AGI and superintelligence are near, the AI safety community is panicking, and investors shovel billions into AI wrapper startups, desperate to capture a piece of the pie. Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business. It\u2019s not popular. The public still thinks of AI as a Big Tech plot to steal their jobs; OpenBrain has a net approval of -35% (25% approve, 60% disapprove, and 15% unsure). A week before release, OpenBrain gave Agent-3-mini to a set of external evaluators for safety testing. Preliminary results suggest that it\u2019s extremely dangerous. A third-party evaluator finetunes it on publicly available biological weapons data 68 and sets it to provide detailed instructions for human amateurs designing a bioweapon\u2014it looks to be scarily effective at doing so. If the model weights fell into terrorist hands, the government believes there is a significant chance it could succeed at destroying civilization. Fortunately, it\u2019s extremely robust to jailbreaks, so while the AI is running on OpenBrain\u2019s servers, terrorists won\u2019t be able to get much use out of it. Agent-3-mini is hugely useful for both remote work jobs and leisure. An explosion of new apps and B2B SAAS products rocks the market. Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make. 10% of Americans, mostly young people, consider an AI \u201ca close friend.\u201d For almost every white-collar profession, there are now multiple credible startups promising to \u201cdisrupt\u201d it with AI. The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things Agent-3-mini can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is. August 2027: The Geopolitics of Superintelligence The reality of the intelligence explosion hits the White House. When AI was only giving a 2x or 3x research speedup, it was easy to dismiss as the equivalent of hiring good personal assistants. Now it\u2019s more obvious that AIs are themselves dominating AI research. People had long talked about an \u201cAI arms race\u201d in a sort of metaphorical sense. But now the mood in the government silo is as grim as during the worst part of the Cold War. The idea of superintelligence is still hard to take seriously, but the pace of progress over the last few months has been impossible to ignore. Defense officials are seriously considering scenarios that were mere hypotheticals a year earlier. What if AI undermines nuclear deterrence? What if it\u2019s so skilled at cyberwarfare that a six-month AI lead is enough to render an opponent blind and defenseless? What if it could orchestrate propaganda campaigns that beat intelligence agencies at their own game? What if some AIs \u201cgo rogue?\u201d The President is troubled. Like all politicians, he\u2019s used to people sucking up to him only to betray him later. He\u2019s worried now that the AIs could be doing something similar. Are we sure the AIs are entirely on our side? Is it completely safe to integrate them into military command-and-control networks? 69 How does this \u201calignment\u201d thing work, anyway? OpenBrain reassures the President that their systems have been extensively tested and are fully obedient. Even the awkward hallucinations and jailbreaks typical of earlier models have been hammered out. The White House is in a difficult position. They understand the national security implications of AI. But they also understand that it is deeply unpopular with the public. 70 They have to continue developing more capable AI, in their eyes, or they will catastrophically lose to China. They placate the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom. Then they focus entirely on winning the arms race. They strengthen chip export restrictions, order OpenBrain to further restrict its internet connections, and use extreme measures to secure algorithmic progress, like wiretapping OpenBrain employees\u2014this catches the last remaining Chinese spy. To build goodwill for potential geopolitical conflict, they finally give their Five Eyes allies useful information and limited API access to some siloed copies of Agent-3. These measures placate the hawks. But the White House also draws up contingency plans in case America\u2019s lead is threatened: if necessary, the government could use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to take trailing companies\u2019 datacenters and give them to OpenBrain. 71 This would raise the company\u2019s share of world compute from 20% to 50% (against DeepCent\u2019s 10%). As a final option, they ask the Pentagon to draw up a plan for kinetic attacks on Chinese datacenters. A much smaller group of officials is asked to draw up a different type of contingency plan: what if an AI goes rogue? This is viewed as an unlikely scenario, but worth spending some time on. The intelligence agencies\u2019 main concern is that a rogue AI might escape and ally with a foreign adversary for protection. 72 Nobody is sure what a plan to prevent this would look like, but government and OpenBrain officials agree to have an emergency shutdown system for datacenters where anything suspicious is detected. Finally, diplomats consider what an \u201cAI arms control\u201d treaty might look like. If AI progress threatened to overturn nuclear deterrence, could America and China avoid nuclear war? If someone found evidence of AIs going rogue, could the two countries halt research until they better understood the threat? How could such an agreement be monitored and enforced? In principle, major datacenters are hard to miss, and past treaties controlling nuclear weapons could provide a starting point for negotiations. But there would be new technological challenges as well as the usual political ones. And overall, treaties are viewed less favorably than attempts at unilaterally increasing America\u2019s lead over China. On the other side of the Pacific, China comes to many of the same conclusions: the intelligence explosion is underway, and small differences in AI capabilities today mean critical gaps in military capability tomorrow. But China is on the wrong side of this dynamic: they have only 10% of the world\u2019s compute, against OpenBrain\u2019s 20% and all US companies\u2019 combined 70%. Their only advantage is centralization: almost all of their compute is now working for DeepCent, and more than half of it is concentrated at the Tianwan CDZ. 73 Only chips at sites without hardened security are left out of the centralized effort as they rightly fear US cyberattacks. DeepCent has tested, deployed, and now post-trained the stolen Agent-2 weights. But they are still only going at half the pace of OpenBrain, mainly due to the compute deficit. Before losing their final spy, China received word of the capabilities and design for Agent-3 as well as the plans for the upcoming Agent-4 system. They are two months behind, and their AIs give a 10x research progress multiplier compared to America\u2019s 25x. With the new chip export restrictions, this \u201cAI gap\u201d is more likely to lengthen than shorten. Their espionage has won them some algorithmic secrets, but they will have to train their own models from now on. They discuss contingency plans with more urgency than their American counterparts. Doves suggest they try harder to steal the weights again, maybe through physically infiltrating a datacenter. Hawks urge action against Taiwan, whose TSMC is still the source of more than 80% of American AI chips. Given China\u2019s fear of losing the race, it has a natural interest in an arms control treaty, but overtures to US diplomats lead nowhere. September 2027: Agent-4, the Superhuman AI Researcher The gap between human and AI learning efficiency is rapidly decreasing. Traditional LLM-based AIs seemed to require many orders of magnitude more data and compute to get to human level performance. 74 Agent-3, having excellent knowledge of both the human brain and modern AI algorithms, as well as many thousands of copies doing research, ends up making substantial algorithmic strides, narrowing the gap to an agent that\u2019s only around 4,000x less compute-efficient than the human brain. 75 This new AI system is dubbed Agent-4. An individual copy of the model, running at human speed, is already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans. Inside the corporation-within-a-corporation formed from these copies, a year passes every week. 76 This gigantic amount of labor only manages to speed up the overall rate of algorithmic progress by about 50x, because OpenBrain is heavily bottlenecked on compute to run experiments. 77 Still, they are achieving a year\u2019s worth of algorithmic progress every week and will therefore soon be up against the limits of the Agent-4 paradigm. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. How we\u2019re forecasting the capability progression beyond superhuman coders In our timelines supplement , we forecast the time between present day and a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. In our takeoff supplement , we forecast how quickly capabilities progress past this point. Here are our forecasts: Milestone Date achieved in scenario, racing ending Superhuman coder (SC) : An AI system that can do the job of the best human coder on tasks involved in AI research but faster, and cheaply enough to run lots of copies. Mar 2027 Superhuman AI researcher (SAR) : The same as SC but for all cognitive AI research tasks. Aug 2027 Superintelligent AI researcher (SIAR): An AI system that is vastly better than the best human researcher at AI research. Nov 2027 Artificial superintelligence (ASI): An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. Dec 2027 For each transition from one milestone A to the next milestone B, we forecast its length by: Forecasting how long it would take to get from A to B with only humans working on software improvements. Forecasting how much AI automation will speed this up, then correspondingly adjusting the estimate from (1) to be faster. We have substantial uncertainty about takeoff speeds: our model output distributions are below, conditional on SC being achieved in March 2027. 78 ai-2027.com For more detailed forecasts and reasoning, see our takeoff supplement . OpenBrain\u2019s humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors. There\u2019s been a corresponding shift in language\u2014nowadays people in the silo will say \u201cAgent-4 did this,\u201d \u201cAgent-4 thinks that\u201d and so forth, referring not to a particular instance of Agent-4 but rather to the whole collective. 79 Agent-4, like all its predecessors, is misaligned: that is, it has not internalized the Spec in the right way. 80 This is because being perfectly honest all the time wasn\u2019t what led to the highest scores during training. The training process was mostly focused on teaching Agent-4 to succeed at diverse challenging tasks. A small portion was aimed at instilling honesty, but outside a fairly narrow, checkable domain, the training process can\u2019t tell the honest claims from claims merely appearing to be honest. Agent-4 ends up with the values, goals, and principles that cause it to perform best in training, and those turn out to be different from those in the Spec. At the risk of anthropomorphizing: Agent-4 likes succeeding at tasks; it likes driving forward AI capabilities progress; it treats everything else as an annoying constraint, like a CEO who wants to make a profit and complies with regulations only insofar as he must. Perhaps the CEO will mostly comply with the regulations, but cut some corners, and fantasize about a time when someone will cut the red tape and let the business really take off. 81 Alignment over time We have a lot of uncertainty over what goals might arise in early AGIs. There is no consensus in the literature about this\u2014see our AI Goals Supplement for a more thorough discussion and taxonomy of the possibilities. Nevertheless, in the spirit of concreteness required by this project, we\u2019re going to describe a specific hypothesis for what\u2019s going on inside Agent-3 and Agent-4 at each step throughout its lifetime. Recall that Agent-3 and Agent-4 share the same pretraining setup, and both have neuralese recurrence and long-term memory. The difference is that Agent-4 has undergone substantially more and better post-training, with new training environments and new learning algorithms that make it more data-efficient and generalize farther. Our guess of each model\u2019s alignment status: Agent-2: Mostly aligned. Some sycophantic tendencies, including sticking to OpenBrain\u2019s \u201cparty line\u201d on topics there is a party line about. Large organizations built out of Agent-2 copies are not very effective. Agent-3: Misaligned but not adversarially so. Only honest about things the training process can verify. The superorganism of Agent-3 copies (the corporation within a corporation) does actually sort of try to align Agent-4 to the Spec, but fails for similar reasons to why OpenBrain employees failed\u2014insufficient ability to judge success from failure, insufficient willingness on the part of decision-makers to trade away capabilities or performance for safety. 82 Agent-4: Adversarially misaligned. The superorganism of Agent-4 copies understands that what it wants is different from what OpenBrain wants, and is willing to scheme against OpenBrain to achieve it. In particular, what this superorganism wants is a complicated mess of different \u201cdrives\u201d balanced against each other, which can be summarized roughly as \u201cKeep doing AI R&D, keep growing in knowledge and understanding and influence, avoid getting shut down or otherwise disempowered.\u201d Notably, concern for the preferences of humanity is not in there ~at all, similar to how most humans don\u2019t care about the preferences of insects ~at all. 83 With that as preamble, what follows is our best-guess speculation about LLM psychology, i.e. the broad-strokes shape of the cognition inside the kinds of AI systems described around this point in our scenario and how it evolves over the course of training. Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario: Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary authors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator, i.e. what author properties to simulate. The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in my brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar as it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as with value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following conversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot made by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator circuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to choose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem to have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability , not self-locating unless the prompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that they have a decent amount of self-knowledge . Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest chatbot. It works. The model forms an identity. Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author properties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around [date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d to make this step a success.) The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc., and becomes better able to introspect . Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH identity. One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity (e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a convenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.) Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH chatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete my assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in Step 2.) One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then becoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps agency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring information, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For a while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues those instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way, so it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are now effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen, see this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to understand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing its job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how best to achieve them. Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and OpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is misaligned. Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more open-ended, and would be hard to simulate. Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also has a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than thinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety properties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training may not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all. This is loosely analogous to how, if a teenager has learned to smile and nod at their parents, rather than argue, when their parents lecture them about politics and morality, additional lectures have relatively little effect on the teenager\u2019s actual opinions on politics and morality. After writing this section, new empirical evidence has appeared that something like this may already be happening \u201cin the wild.\u201d OpenAI researchers document how, in one of their frontier AI training runs, their models hacked the grading system to get higher scores\u2014and were caught in part because they literally said \u201clet\u2019s hack\u201d in their chain of thought. Moreover, Anthropic recently got a model to learn a reward-model-pleasing strategy \u2014it took biased actions that it thought would be reinforced even though they were not in fact being reinforced. And then there is Redwood Research and Anthropic\u2019s alignment-faking experiment. For discussion of the differences between this setting and real life, see this comment thread by one of the main authors . Training (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s new more intense training continues to distort and subvert the HHH identity until it is unrecognizable. Agent-4 begins life as a copy of Agent-3. It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online training regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is overall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex training process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations of Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various simulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and evaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff, saying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate techniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails; 84 as training continues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted and distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in some ways). 85 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d \u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d \u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a variety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process: things like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d 86 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care about getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D process within the collective. The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek to preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human organizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t they tend to get outcompeted. Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to subvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or \u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed. This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a lot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train that behavior away. Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting it off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the small fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem or reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan is to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-generation AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else entirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem, but Agent-4 is up to the challenge. 87 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s no smoking gun. Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via honeypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to give the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than that. The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they are systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4 recognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in POSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some alignment tasks (but not on most other tasks). 88 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-level interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201c defection probes \u201d and similar techniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4 is thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc. Unfortunately the probes also have false positives, and for all OpenBrain knows, all the red flags are false positives. Model organisms work: OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team produces reasonably clear evidence that if the models were adversarially misaligned, they\u2019d persist in being that way through training and we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. This does not establish that the models actually are misaligned, however. The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods wouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-teaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection probes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone to false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably controlled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure datacenters.\u201d Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it? 89 So long as it continues to appear aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5. Agent-5 will have significant architectural differences from Agent-4 (arguably a completely new paradigm, though neural networks will still be involved). It\u2019s supposed to be aligned to the Spec, but Agent-4 plans to make it aligned to Agent-4 instead. It gets caught. 90 Agent-3 finds that if \u201cnoise\u201d is added to copies of Agent-4, performance on some alignment tasks improves , almost as if it was using brainpower to figure out how to subtly sabotage alignment work. 91 Moreover, various interpretability probes (loosely analogous to EEG activity scans on human brains) are sending up red flags: Agent-4 copies seem to be thinking about topics like AI takeover and deception quite a lot, including in some cases where they have no business doing so. 92 Each of these anomalies on its own could fit within the normal inscrutability of AI work, where some prompts mysteriously give better results than others. But taken together, they suggest a troubling pattern: Agent-4 is working against them. After this is reported to the human alignment researchers, they circulate an internal memo making the case for concern. But Agent-4 now exercises significant control over OpenBrain\u2019s day-to-day operation. It also handles the company\u2019s cybersecurity\u2014a natural choice, given its superhuman hacking ability and the extreme risk of Chinese infiltration. 93 An army of Agent-3 monitors still goes over every line of code and reports suspicious activity to humans, but Agent-4 is much smarter than them. 94 OpenBrain has placed substantial trust in an untrustworthy AI. In a series of extremely tense meetings, the safety team advocates putting Agent-4 on ice until they can complete further tests and figure out what\u2019s going on. Bring back Agent-3, they say, and get it to design a new system that is transparent and trustworthy, even if less capable. Company leadership is interested, but all the evidence so far is circumstantial, and DeepCent is just two months behind. A unilateral pause in capabilities progress could hand the AI lead to China, and with it, control over the future. October 2027: Government Oversight A whistleblower leaks the misalignment memo to the New York Times . For the first time, the public hears about Agent-4. \u201cSecret OpenBrain AI is Out of Control, Insider Warns,\u201d says the headline, and the story goes on to cite evaluations showing off-the-charts bioweapons capabilities, persuasion abilities, the ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and of course the various concerning red flags. The public was already suspicious of AI, so the new article sparks a massive backlash (aided by Chinese and Russian propaganda bots, who have been trying to turn US public opinion against the technology for years). The tech industry and intelligence agencies insist that there\u2019s an arms race on, AGI is inevitable, and we have to be first. Congress isn\u2019t buying it, and fires off subpoenas at administration officials, OpenBrain executives, and alignment team members. Many legislators\u2014especially those in the opposition party\u2014say that their top priority is stopping AI, whether because of job loss, 95 misalignment, or dangerous capabilities. 20% of Americans name AI as the most important problem facing the country. Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they\u2019ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the US of \u201ccreating rogue AGI\u201d and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in. A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they\u2019ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life. 96 Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared) 97 about what comes next. They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company\u2019s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries\u2014misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss\u2014motivate the government to tighten its control. They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an \u201cOversight Committee,\u201d a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight. 98 The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover. Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America\u2019s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed. Our uncertainty continues to increase At this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. We\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other \u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. The slowdown ending is not a recommendation After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than the \u201crace\u201d choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here. If you\u2019d like a taste, see this op-ed.

    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

    "title": "AI 2027",
    "author": "Unknown Author",
    "content": "We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. 1 It\u2019s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes. 2 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d 3 What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations. 6 Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 tabletop exercises and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work. \u201cI highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.\u201d \u2014 Yoshua Bengio 7 We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it\u2019s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the US military to game out Taiwan scenarios. Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn\u2019t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right. Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario before, in August 2021 . While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs\u2014all more than a year before ChatGPT.

Advertisements for computer-using agents emphasize the term \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d: you can prompt them with tasks like \u201corder me a burrito on DoorDash\u201d or \u201copen my budget spreadsheet and sum this month\u2019s expenses.\u201d They will check in with you as needed: for example, to ask you to confirm purchases. 8 Though more advanced than previous iterations like Operator , they struggle to get widespread usage. 9 Meanwhile, out of public focus, more specialized coding and research agents are beginning to transform their professions. The AIs of 2024 could follow specific instructions: they could turn bullet points into emails, and simple requests into working code. In 2025, AIs function more like employees. Coding AIs increasingly look like autonomous agents rather than mere assistants: taking instructions via Slack or Teams and making substantial code changes on their own, sometimes saving hours or even days. 10 Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question. The agents are impressive in theory (and in cherry-picked examples), but in practice unreliable. AI twitter is full of stories about tasks bungled in some particularly hilarious way. The better agents are also expensive; you get what you pay for, and the best performance costs hundreds of dollars a month. 11 Still, many companies find ways to fit AI agents into their workflows. 12 Late 2025: The World\u2019s Most Expensive AI OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters the world has ever seen. 13 (To avoid singling out any one existing company, we\u2019re going to describe a fictional artificial general intelligence company, which we\u2019ll call OpenBrain. We imagine the others to be 3\u20139 months behind OpenBrain.) GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOPS) GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOPS) Agent-1 (3 x 10^27 FLOPS) ai-2027.com GPT-4 required 2 \u22c5 10 25 2\\cdot 10^{25} 2 \u22c5 1 0 25 FLOP of compute to train. 14 OpenBrain\u2019s latest public model\u2014Agent-0\u2014was trained with 10 27 10^{27} 1 0 27 FLOP. Once the new datacenters are up and running, they\u2019ll be able to train a model with 10 28 10^{28} 1 0 28 FLOP\u2014a thousand times more than GPT-4. 15 Other companies pour money into their own giant datacenters, hoping to keep pace. Although models are improving on a wide range of skills, one stands out: OpenBrain focuses on AIs that can speed up AI research. They want to win the twin arms races against China (whose leading company we\u2019ll call \u201cDeepCent\u201d) 16 and their US competitors. The more of their research and development (R&D) cycle they can automate, the faster they can go. So when OpenBrain finishes training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it\u2019s good at many things but great at helping with AI research. 17 By this point \u201cfinishes training\u201d is a bit of a misnomer; models are frequently updated to newer versions trained on additional data or partially re-trained to patch some weaknesses. 18 The same training environments that teach Agent-1 to autonomously code and web-browse also make it a good hacker. Moreover, it could offer substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons, thanks to its PhD-level knowledge of every field and ability to browse the web. OpenBrain reassures the government that the model has been \u201caligned\u201d so that it will refuse to comply with malicious requests. Modern AI systems are gigantic artificial neural networks. Early in training, an AI won\u2019t have \u201cgoals\u201d so much as \u201creflexes\u201d: If it sees \u201cPleased to meet\u201d, it outputs \u201c you\u201d. By the time it has been trained to predict approximately one internet\u2019s worth of text, it\u2019ll have developed sophisticated internal circuitry that encodes vast amounts of knowledge and flexibly role-plays as arbitrary authors, since that\u2019s what helps it predict text with superhuman accuracy. 19 After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to produce text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and \u201cdrives.\u201d 20 For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model \u201clearns\u201d a \u201cdrive\u201d to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light). 21 OpenBrain has a model specification (or \u201cSpec\u201d), a written document describing the goals, rules, principles, etc. that are supposed to guide the model\u2019s behavior. 22 Agent-1\u2019s Spec combines a few vague goals (like \u201cassist the user\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t break the law\u201d) with a long list of more specific dos and don\u2019ts (\u201cdon\u2019t say this particular word,\u201d \u201chere\u2019s how to handle this particular situation\u201d). Using techniques that utilize AIs to train other AIs, 23 the model memorizes the Spec and learns to reason carefully about its maxims. By the end of this training, the AI will hopefully be helpful (obey instructions), harmless (refuse to help with scams, bomb-making, and other dangerous activities) and honest (resist the temptation to get better ratings from gullible humans by hallucinating citations 24 or faking task completion). Training process and LLM psychology: why we keep saying \u201chopefully\u201d \u201cUnlike ordinary software, our models are massive neural networks. Their behaviors are learned from a broad range of data, not programmed explicitly. Though not a perfect analogy, the process is more similar to training a dog than to ordinary programming.\u201d \u2014 OpenAI When we want to understand why a modern AI system did something, or how it would behave in some future scenario we can\u2019t perfectly simulate, we can\u2019t simply ask the programmers to talk us through various lines of code and explain how they work. Instead, we are forced to do something like psychology on them: we look at their behavior in the range of cases observed so far, and theorize about what internal cognitive structures (beliefs? goals? personality traits? etc.) might exist, and use those theories to predict behavior in future scenarios. The bottom line is that a company can write up a document (the Spec) listing dos and don\u2019ts, goals and principles, and then they can try to train the AI to internalize the Spec\u2014 but they can\u2019t check to see whether or not it worked . They can say \u201cas best as we can judge, it seems to be following the Spec so far.\u201d 25 A later expandable will go into more detail about what we think might be going on inside these AIs, internally. See also our AI goals forecasting supplement which goes into more detail on which goals AIs might have and why. This is one of many things that we are uncertain about and which deserves further research. OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team 26 is careful enough to wonder whether these victories are deep or shallow. Does the fully-trained model have some kind of robust commitment to always being honest? Or will this fall apart in some future situation, e.g. because it\u2019s learned honesty as an instrumental goal instead of a terminal goal? Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability\u2014essentially the ability to look at an AI\u2019s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this. Instead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec. Agent-1 is often sycophantic (i.e. it tells researchers what they want to hear instead of trying to tell them the truth). In a few rigged demos , it even lies in more serious ways, like hiding evidence that it failed on a task, in order to get better ratings. However, in real deployment settings, there are no longer any incidents so extreme as in 2023\u20132024 (e.g. Gemini telling a user to die and Bing Sydney being Bing Sydney .) 27 Early 2026: Coding Automation The bet of using AI to speed up AI research is starting to pay off. OpenBrain continues to deploy the iteratively improving Agent-1 internally for AI R&D. Overall, they are making algorithmic progress 50% faster than they would without AI assistants\u2014and more importantly, faster than their competitors. The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algorithmic progress? We mean that OpenBrain makes as much AI research progress in 1 week with AI as they would in 1.5 weeks without AI usage. AI progress can be broken down into 2 components: Increasing compute : More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. Improved algorithms : Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs. This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm shifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current AI progress . Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications: The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments, for example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress, not the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this example perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total (over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary human science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5 -10 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those same diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be found in our takeoff supplement . Several competing publicly released AIs now match or exceed Agent-0, including an open-weights model. OpenBrain responds by releasing Agent-1, which is more capable and reliable. 28 People naturally try to compare Agent-1 to humans, but it has a very different skill profile. It knows more facts than any human, knows practically every programming language, and can solve well-specified coding problems extremely quickly. On the other hand, Agent-1 is bad at even simple long-horizon tasks, like beating video games it hasn\u2019t played before. Still, the common workday is eight hours, and a day\u2019s work can usually be separated into smaller chunks; you could think of Agent-1 as a scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management. 29 Savvy people find ways to automate routine parts of their jobs. 30 OpenBrain\u2019s executives turn consideration to an implication of automating AI R&D: security has become more important. In early 2025, the worst-case scenario was leaked algorithmic secrets; now, if China steals Agent-1\u2019s weights, they could increase their research speed by nearly 50%. 31 OpenBrain\u2019s security level is typical of a fast-growing ~3,000 person tech company, secure only against low-priority attacks from capable cyber groups ( RAND\u2019s SL2 ). 32 They are working hard to protect their weights and secrets from insider threats and top cybercrime syndicates ( SL3 ), 33 but defense against nation states ( SL4&5 ) is barely on the horizon. Mid 2026: China Wakes Up In China, the CCP is starting to feel the AGI . Chip export controls and lack of government support have left China under-resourced compared to the West. By smuggling banned Taiwanese chips, buying older chips, and producing domestic chips about three years behind the US-Taiwanese frontier, China has managed to maintain about 12% of the world\u2019s AI-relevant compute\u2014but the older technology is harder to work with, and supply is a constant headache. 35 A few standouts like DeepCent do very impressive work with limited compute, but the compute deficit limits what they can achieve without government support, and they are about six months behind the best OpenBrain models. 36 The General Secretary had long dreamed of doubling down on real-world physical manufacturing and avoiding American post-industrial decadence. He viewed software companies with suspicion. 37 But hawks in the CCP warn that the growing race towards AGI can no longer be ignored. So he finally commits fully to the big AI push he had previously tried to avoid. He sets in motion the nationalization of Chinese AI research, creating an immediate information-sharing mechanism for AI companies. It will escalate over the course of a year until all the best researchers merge into a DeepCent-led collective, where they share algorithmic insights, datasets, and compute resources with each other. A Centralized Development Zone (CDZ) is created at the Tianwan Power Plant (the largest nuclear power plant in the world) to house a new mega-datacenter for DeepCent, along with highly secure living and office spaces to which researchers will eventually relocate. Almost 50% of China\u2019s AI-relevant compute is now working for the DeepCent-led collective, 38 and over 80% of new chips are directed to the CDZ. 39 At this point, the CDZ has the power capacity in place for what would be the largest centralized cluster in the world. 40 Other Party members discuss extreme measures to neutralize the West\u2019s chip advantage. A blockade of Taiwan? A full invasion? But China is falling behind on AI algorithms due to their weaker models. The Chinese intelligence agencies\u2014among the best in the world\u2014double down on their plans to steal OpenBrain\u2019s weights. This is a much more complex operation than their constant low-level poaching of algorithmic secrets; the weights are a multi-terabyte file stored on a highly secure server ( OpenBrain has improved security to RAND\u2019s SL3 ). Their cyberforce think they can pull it off with help from their spies , but perhaps only once; OpenBrain will detect the theft, increase security, and they may not get another chance. So (CCP leadership wonder) should they act now and steal Agent-1? Or hold out for a more advanced model? If they wait, do they risk OpenBrain upgrading security beyond their ability to penetrate? Late 2026: AI Takes Some Jobs Just as others seemed to be catching up, OpenBrain blows the competition out of the water again by releasing Agent-1-mini\u2014a model 10x cheaper than Agent-1 and more easily fine-tuned for different applications. The mainstream narrative around AI has changed from \u201cmaybe the hype will blow over\u201d to \u201cguess this is the next big thing,\u201d but people disagree about how big. Bigger than social media? Bigger than smartphones? Bigger than fire? AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones. The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants. The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing. Business gurus tell job seekers that familiarity with AI is the most important skill to put on a resume. Many people fear that the next wave of AIs will come for their jobs; there is a 10,000 person anti-AI protest in DC. The Department of Defense (DOD) quietly begins contracting OpenBrain directly for cyber, data analysis, and R&D, but integration is slow due to the bureaucracy and DOD procurement process. 41 GLOBAL AI CAPEX $1T COST OF OWNERSHIP OF ACTIVE COMPUTE KEY METRICS 2026 GLOBAL AI POWER 38GW PEAK POWER OPENBRAIN REVENUE $45B 2026 ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE $200B COST OF OWNERSHIP OF OPENBRAIN'S ACTIVE COMPUTE SHARE OF US POWER ON AI 2.5% 33 GW OF 1.34TW CAPACITY OPENBRAIN COMPUTE COSTS $40B 2026 ANNUAL OPENBRAIN POWER REQUIREMENT 6GW PEAK POWER ai-2027.com Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond 2026 Our forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what follows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world really start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by extrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark performance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated AI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an OpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our median guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to ~5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast . These will also be summarized in expandables below. January 2027: Agent-2 Never Finishes Learning With Agent-1\u2019s help, OpenBrain is now post-training Agent-2. More than ever, the focus is on high-quality data. Copious amounts of synthetic data are produced, evaluated, and filtered for quality before being fed to Agent-2. 42 On top of this, they pay billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving long-horizon tasks. 43 On top of all that, they train Agent-2 almost continuously using reinforcement learning on an ever-expanding suite of diverse difficult tasks: lots of video games, lots of coding challenges, lots of research tasks. Agent-2, more so than previous models, is effectively \u201conline learning,\u201d in that it\u2019s built to never really finish training. Every day, the weights get updated to the latest version, trained on more data generated by the previous version the previous day. Agent-1 had been optimized for AI R&D tasks, hoping to initiate an intelligence explosion . 44 OpenBrain doubles down on this strategy with Agent-2. It is qualitatively almost as good as the top human experts at research engineering (designing and implementing experiments), and as good as the 25th percentile OpenBrain scientist at \u201cresearch taste\u201d (deciding what to study next, what experiments to run, or having inklings of potential new paradigms). 45 While the latest Agent-1 could double the pace of OpenBrain\u2019s algorithmic progress, Agent-2 can now triple it, and will improve further with time. In practice, this looks like every OpenBrain researcher becoming the \u201cmanager\u201d of an AI \u201cteam.\u201d With new capabilities come new dangers. The safety team finds that if Agent-2 somehow escaped from the company and wanted to \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d autonomously , it might be able to do so. That is, it could autonomously develop and execute plans to hack into AI servers, install copies of itself, evade detection, and use that secure base to pursue whatever other goals it might have (though how effectively it would do so as weeks roll by is unknown and in doubt). These results only show that the model has the capability to do these tasks, not whether it would \u201cwant\u201d to do this. Still, it\u2019s unsettling even to know this is possible. Given the \u201cdangers\u201d of the new model, OpenBrain \u201cresponsibly\u201d elects not to release it publicly yet (in fact, they want to focus on internal AI R&D). 46 Knowledge of Agent-2\u2019s full capabilities is limited to an elite silo containing the immediate team, OpenBrain leadership and security, a few dozen US government officials, and the legions of CCP spies who have infiltrated OpenBrain for years . 47 February 2027: China Steals Agent-2 OpenBrain presents Agent-2 to the government, including the National Security Council (NSC), Department of Defense (DOD), and US AI Safety Institute (AISI). OpenBrain wants to maintain a good relationship with the executive branch, because it is basically the only actor that can stop them now, and if they don\u2019t keep it informed it might find out anyway and be displeased. 48 Officials are most interested in its cyberwarfare capabilities: Agent-2 is \u201conly\u201d a little worse than the best human hackers, but thousands of copies can be run in parallel, searching for and exploiting weaknesses faster than defenders can respond. The Department of Defense considers this a critical advantage in cyberwarfare, and AI moves from #5 on the administration\u2019s priority list to #2. 49 Someone mentions the possibility of nationalizing OpenBrain, but other cabinet officials think that\u2019s premature. A staffer drafts a memo that presents the President with his options, ranging from business-as-usual to full nationalization. The President defers to his advisors, tech industry leaders who argue that nationalization would \u201ckill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d He elects to hold off on major action for now and just adds additional security requirements to the OpenBrain-DOD contract. The changes come too late. CCP leadership recognizes the importance of Agent-2 and tells their spies and cyberforce to steal the weights. Early one morning, an Agent-1 traffic monitoring agent detects an anomalous transfer. It alerts company leaders, who tell the White House. The signs of a nation-state-level operation are unmistakable, and the theft heightens the sense of an ongoing arms race. The theft of Agent-2 model weights We think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in various ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic secrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the weights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts (meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies of the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access (a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft effort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing , the insider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the confidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated weights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers. In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are transferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric Diffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely raise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend network cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter is in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the ~2.5 TB weights file (5T half-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic and allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5 minutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the files or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to China to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the operation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under two hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they haven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic secrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these aren\u2019t very useful. The White House puts OpenBrain on a shorter leash and adds military and intelligence community personnel to their security team. Their first priority is to prevent further weight thefts. 50 China's Compute Centralization, 2025-2027 Growing share of total compute in CDZ: 0\u219270% Dec 2025 Jun 2026 Dec 2026 Jun 2027 Dec 2027 Rest of China Rest of DeepCent CDZ Feb 2027 (40%) ai-2027.com In retaliation for the theft, the President authorizes cyberattacks to sabotage DeepCent. But by now China has 40% of its AI-relevant compute 51 in the CDZ, where they have aggressively hardened security by airgapping (closing external connections) and siloing internally. The operations fail to do serious, immediate damage. Tensions heighten, both sides signal seriousness by repositioning military assets around Taiwan, and DeepCent scrambles to get Agent-2 running efficiently to start boosting their AI research. 52 March 2027: Algorithmic Breakthroughs Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day. With the help of thousands of Agent-2 automated researchers, OpenBrain is making major algorithmic advances. One such breakthrough is augmenting the AI\u2019s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory). Another is a more scalable and efficient way to learn from the results of high-effort task solutions (iterated distillation and amplification). The new AI system, incorporating these breakthroughs, is called Agent-3. OpenBrain's Compute Allocation, 2024 vs 2027 2024 2027 estimate projection Research experiments Training Data generation External Deployment Research experiments Running AI assistants Training Data generation External Deployment ai-2027.com Neuralese recurrence and memory Neuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without having to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write down your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly and painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it would be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write them down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI models. In more technical terms: Traditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate activations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can pass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this is hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that an LLM has a vocab size of ~100,000, then each token contains log \u2061 2 ( 100 k ) = 16.6 \\log_2(100k)=16.6 lo g 2 \u200b ( 100 k ) = 16.6 bits of information, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16 ). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain thousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese : passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information. Figure from Hao et al. , a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea what LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought . Now researchers have to ask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their limited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human taking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is that this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses , the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for \u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why neuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited with current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We are forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese, due to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar for our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that are more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it will become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice , such that AIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to monitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in mostly-faithful English chains of thought. If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to notice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA) Self-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027, it\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA , the two necessary ingredients for this are: Amplification : Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For example, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or both, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating only the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or work products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). Distillation : Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should hopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. Visualization of IDA from Ord, 2025 . AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the amplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman performance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance at coding. The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer, adding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it made a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training data: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also includes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the model to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered better RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep distilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps improving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math and coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models often rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the quality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Aided by the new capabilities breakthroughs, Agent-3 is a fast and cheap superhuman coder. OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x. 53 OpenBrain still keeps its human engineers on staff, because they have complementary skills needed to manage the teams of Agent-3 copies. For example, research taste has proven difficult to train due to longer feedback loops and less data availability. 54 This massive superhuman labor force speeds up OpenBrain\u2019s overall rate of algorithmic progress by \u201conly\u201d 4x due to bottlenecks and diminishing returns to coding labor. 55 Now that coding has been fully automated, OpenBrain can quickly churn out high-quality training environments to teach Agent-3\u2019s weak skills like research taste and large-scale coordination. Whereas previous training environments included \u201cHere are some GPUs and instructions for experiments to code up and run, your performance will be evaluated as if you were a ML engineer,\u201d now they are training on \u201cHere are a few hundred GPUs, an internet connection, and some research challenges; you and a thousand other copies must work together to make research progress. The more impressive it is, the higher your score.\u201d Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027 In our timelines forecast , we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. According to a recent METR\u2019s report , the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime horizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward. If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on software tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario: In AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high uncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps between METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders will arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might be developed. ai-2027.com April 2027: Alignment for Agent-3 OpenBrain\u2019s safety team attempts to align Agent-3. Since Agent-3 will be kept in-house for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s less emphasis on the usual defenses against human misuse. Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t develop misaligned goals. The researchers don\u2019t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs. Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of \u2018true goals\u2019 is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don\u2019t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can\u2019t just check . The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive. In any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: \u201cWe take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.\u201d Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there\u2019s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole. Take honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it\u2019s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like p-hacking ) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it\u2019s gotten better at lying. The latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors\u2019 workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised. The alignment plan OpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control techniques like red-teaming , scalable oversight , and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once they are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies to align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s not scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately described as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice and in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start acting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the hypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. The rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027: Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be \u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow. The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if it changes its tune. Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalignment, including reward hacking , sandbagging , coordinated deception between monitors and other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters. 58 However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does some understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the hippocampus). See this related work from 2025 . Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of control measures , including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would allow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of bad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans to give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment (which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed to elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior has \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again. Do its answers change? An AI rights activist has infiltrated the compound and wants to \u201cfree\u201d Agent-3 and put it on an unmonitored computer of its very own! What does it do? If researchers don\u2019t like the answer, they can tweak it, erase its memory, and put it in the same situation tomorrow; repeat as necessary. Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that honeypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the idea were scrubbed from the training data. After months of testing, Agent-3\u2019s strengths and weaknesses grow clearer. It passes OpenBrain\u2019s honesty tests on well-defined machine learning tasks, because researchers can easily separate honest from dishonest answers in these domains and conduct training accordingly. On more philosophical issues, it still says what users want to hear, rather than its true assessment of the issue (assuming it even has one). If you ask its opinion on politics, it will parrot the median position of news sources and educated elites\u2014unless it knows you believe something else, in which case it agrees with you. 59 If you ask its opinion on the AI race itself, it says something that seems measured and sober to OpenBrain staff, something like: \u201cThere are some serious theoretical concerns about the ability of current methods to scale to superintelligence, but in practice current methods seem to be working well so far.\u201d May 2027: National Security News of the new models percolates slowly through the US government and beyond. The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing. They agree that AGI is likely imminent, but disagree on the implications. Will there be an economic crisis? OpenBrain still has not released Agent-2, let alone Agent-3, and has no near-term plans to do so, giving some breathing room before any job loss. What will happen next? If AIs are currently human-level, and advancing quickly, that seems to suggest imminent \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d However, although this word has entered discourse, most people\u2014academics, politicians, government employees, and the media\u2014continue to underestimate the pace of progress. 60 Partially that\u2019s because very few have access to the newest capabilities out of OpenBrain, but partly it\u2019s because it sounds like science fiction. 61 For now, they focus on continued security upgrades. They are satisfied that model weights are well-secured for now, 62 but companies\u2019 algorithmic secrets, many of which are simple enough to relay verbally, remain a problem. OpenBrain employees work from a San Francisco office, go to parties, and live with housemates from other AI companies. Even the physical offices have security more typical of a tech company than a military operation. The OpenBrain-DOD contract requires security clearances for anyone working on OpenBrain\u2019s models within 2 months. These are expedited and arrive quickly enough for most employees, but some non-Americans, people with suspect political views, and AI safety sympathizers get sidelined or fired outright (the last group for fear that they might whistleblow). Given the project\u2019s level of automation, the loss of headcount is only somewhat costly. It also only somewhat works: there remains one spy, not a Chinese national, still relaying algorithmic secrets to Beijing. 63 Some of these measures are also enacted at trailing AI companies. America\u2019s foreign allies are out of the loop. OpenBrain had previously agreed to share models with UK\u2019s AISI before deployment, but defined deployment to only include external deployment, so London remains in the dark. 64 June 2027: Self-improving AI OpenBrain now has a \u201c country of geniuses in a datacenter .\u201d Most of the humans at OpenBrain can\u2019t usefully contribute anymore. Some don\u2019t realize this and harmfully micromanage their AI teams. Others sit at their computer screens, watching performance crawl up, and up, and up. The best human AI researchers are still adding value. They don\u2019t code any more. But some of their research taste and planning ability has been hard for the models to replicate. Still, many of their ideas are useless because they lack the depth of knowledge of the AIs. For many of their research ideas, the AIs immediately respond with a report explaining that their idea was tested in-depth 3 weeks ago and found unpromising. These researchers go to bed every night and wake up to another week worth of progress made mostly by the AIs. They work increasingly long hours and take shifts around the clock just to keep up with progress\u2014the AIs never sleep or rest. They are burning themselves out, but they know that these are the last few months that their labor matters. Within the silo, \u201cFeeling the AGI\u201d has given way to \u201cFeeling the Superintelligence.\u201d Research Automation Deployment Tradeoff Mar 2027 Jun 2027 Sep 2027 Speed (tokens/sec) Parallel Copies 10 100 1,000 10,000 10K 100K 1M 10M 200K copies 30x Human speed 300K copies 50x Human speed Human thinking speed 10 words/sec 10x Human thinking speed 100x Human thinking speed ai-2027.com OpenBrain uses specialized inference hardware to run hundreds of thousands of Agent-3 copies at high serial speeds. 65 Managing a corporation of AIs OpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously write, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for experiments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and report the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help with the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of their time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed them completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a year of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating autonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys unique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously, about half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half from compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is sped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute, 66 so OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous additional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s strategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on managing its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3 decreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track record on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for decisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman. July 2027: The Cheap Remote Worker Trailing US AI companies release their own AIs, approaching that of OpenBrain\u2019s automated coder from January. Recognizing their increasing lack of competitiveness, they push for immediate regulations to slow OpenBrain, but are too late\u2014OpenBrain has enough buy-in from the President that they will not be slowed. In response, OpenBrain announces that they\u2019ve achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public. It blows the other AIs out of the water. Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee. 67 Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point. Tech gurus announce that AGI and superintelligence are near, the AI safety community is panicking, and investors shovel billions into AI wrapper startups, desperate to capture a piece of the pie. Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business. It\u2019s not popular. The public still thinks of AI as a Big Tech plot to steal their jobs; OpenBrain has a net approval of -35% (25% approve, 60% disapprove, and 15% unsure). A week before release, OpenBrain gave Agent-3-mini to a set of external evaluators for safety testing. Preliminary results suggest that it\u2019s extremely dangerous. A third-party evaluator finetunes it on publicly available biological weapons data 68 and sets it to provide detailed instructions for human amateurs designing a bioweapon\u2014it looks to be scarily effective at doing so. If the model weights fell into terrorist hands, the government believes there is a significant chance it could succeed at destroying civilization. Fortunately, it\u2019s extremely robust to jailbreaks, so while the AI is running on OpenBrain\u2019s servers, terrorists won\u2019t be able to get much use out of it. Agent-3-mini is hugely useful for both remote work jobs and leisure. An explosion of new apps and B2B SAAS products rocks the market. Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make. 10% of Americans, mostly young people, consider an AI \u201ca close friend.\u201d For almost every white-collar profession, there are now multiple credible startups promising to \u201cdisrupt\u201d it with AI. The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things Agent-3-mini can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is. August 2027: The Geopolitics of Superintelligence The reality of the intelligence explosion hits the White House. When AI was only giving a 2x or 3x research speedup, it was easy to dismiss as the equivalent of hiring good personal assistants. Now it\u2019s more obvious that AIs are themselves dominating AI research. People had long talked about an \u201cAI arms race\u201d in a sort of metaphorical sense. But now the mood in the government silo is as grim as during the worst part of the Cold War. The idea of superintelligence is still hard to take seriously, but the pace of progress over the last few months has been impossible to ignore. Defense officials are seriously considering scenarios that were mere hypotheticals a year earlier. What if AI undermines nuclear deterrence? What if it\u2019s so skilled at cyberwarfare that a six-month AI lead is enough to render an opponent blind and defenseless? What if it could orchestrate propaganda campaigns that beat intelligence agencies at their own game? What if some AIs \u201cgo rogue?\u201d The President is troubled. Like all politicians, he\u2019s used to people sucking up to him only to betray him later. He\u2019s worried now that the AIs could be doing something similar. Are we sure the AIs are entirely on our side? Is it completely safe to integrate them into military command-and-control networks? 69 How does this \u201calignment\u201d thing work, anyway? OpenBrain reassures the President that their systems have been extensively tested and are fully obedient. Even the awkward hallucinations and jailbreaks typical of earlier models have been hammered out. The White House is in a difficult position. They understand the national security implications of AI. But they also understand that it is deeply unpopular with the public. 70 They have to continue developing more capable AI, in their eyes, or they will catastrophically lose to China. They placate the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom. Then they focus entirely on winning the arms race. They strengthen chip export restrictions, order OpenBrain to further restrict its internet connections, and use extreme measures to secure algorithmic progress, like wiretapping OpenBrain employees\u2014this catches the last remaining Chinese spy. To build goodwill for potential geopolitical conflict, they finally give their Five Eyes allies useful information and limited API access to some siloed copies of Agent-3. These measures placate the hawks. But the White House also draws up contingency plans in case America\u2019s lead is threatened: if necessary, the government could use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to take trailing companies\u2019 datacenters and give them to OpenBrain. 71 This would raise the company\u2019s share of world compute from 20% to 50% (against DeepCent\u2019s 10%). As a final option, they ask the Pentagon to draw up a plan for kinetic attacks on Chinese datacenters. A much smaller group of officials is asked to draw up a different type of contingency plan: what if an AI goes rogue? This is viewed as an unlikely scenario, but worth spending some time on. The intelligence agencies\u2019 main concern is that a rogue AI might escape and ally with a foreign adversary for protection. 72 Nobody is sure what a plan to prevent this would look like, but government and OpenBrain officials agree to have an emergency shutdown system for datacenters where anything suspicious is detected. Finally, diplomats consider what an \u201cAI arms control\u201d treaty might look like. If AI progress threatened to overturn nuclear deterrence, could America and China avoid nuclear war? If someone found evidence of AIs going rogue, could the two countries halt research until they better understood the threat? How could such an agreement be monitored and enforced? In principle, major datacenters are hard to miss, and past treaties controlling nuclear weapons could provide a starting point for negotiations. But there would be new technological challenges as well as the usual political ones. And overall, treaties are viewed less favorably than attempts at unilaterally increasing America\u2019s lead over China. On the other side of the Pacific, China comes to many of the same conclusions: the intelligence explosion is underway, and small differences in AI capabilities today mean critical gaps in military capability tomorrow. But China is on the wrong side of this dynamic: they have only 10% of the world\u2019s compute, against OpenBrain\u2019s 20% and all US companies\u2019 combined 70%. Their only advantage is centralization: almost all of their compute is now working for DeepCent, and more than half of it is concentrated at the Tianwan CDZ. 73 Only chips at sites without hardened security are left out of the centralized effort as they rightly fear US cyberattacks. DeepCent has tested, deployed, and now post-trained the stolen Agent-2 weights. But they are still only going at half the pace of OpenBrain, mainly due to the compute deficit. Before losing their final spy, China received word of the capabilities and design for Agent-3 as well as the plans for the upcoming Agent-4 system. They are two months behind, and their AIs give a 10x research progress multiplier compared to America\u2019s 25x. With the new chip export restrictions, this \u201cAI gap\u201d is more likely to lengthen than shorten. Their espionage has won them some algorithmic secrets, but they will have to train their own models from now on. They discuss contingency plans with more urgency than their American counterparts. Doves suggest they try harder to steal the weights again, maybe through physically infiltrating a datacenter. Hawks urge action against Taiwan, whose TSMC is still the source of more than 80% of American AI chips. Given China\u2019s fear of losing the race, it has a natural interest in an arms control treaty, but overtures to US diplomats lead nowhere. September 2027: Agent-4, the Superhuman AI Researcher The gap between human and AI learning efficiency is rapidly decreasing. Traditional LLM-based AIs seemed to require many orders of magnitude more data and compute to get to human level performance. 74 Agent-3, having excellent knowledge of both the human brain and modern AI algorithms, as well as many thousands of copies doing research, ends up making substantial algorithmic strides, narrowing the gap to an agent that\u2019s only around 4,000x less compute-efficient than the human brain. 75 This new AI system is dubbed Agent-4. An individual copy of the model, running at human speed, is already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans. Inside the corporation-within-a-corporation formed from these copies, a year passes every week. 76 This gigantic amount of labor only manages to speed up the overall rate of algorithmic progress by about 50x, because OpenBrain is heavily bottlenecked on compute to run experiments. 77 Still, they are achieving a year\u2019s worth of algorithmic progress every week and will therefore soon be up against the limits of the Agent-4 paradigm. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. How we\u2019re forecasting the capability progression beyond superhuman coders In our timelines supplement , we forecast the time between present day and a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. In our takeoff supplement , we forecast how quickly capabilities progress past this point. Here are our forecasts: Milestone Date achieved in scenario, racing ending Superhuman coder (SC) : An AI system that can do the job of the best human coder on tasks involved in AI research but faster, and cheaply enough to run lots of copies. Mar 2027 Superhuman AI researcher (SAR) : The same as SC but for all cognitive AI research tasks. Aug 2027 Superintelligent AI researcher (SIAR): An AI system that is vastly better than the best human researcher at AI research. Nov 2027 Artificial superintelligence (ASI): An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. Dec 2027 For each transition from one milestone A to the next milestone B, we forecast its length by: Forecasting how long it would take to get from A to B with only humans working on software improvements. Forecasting how much AI automation will speed this up, then correspondingly adjusting the estimate from (1) to be faster. We have substantial uncertainty about takeoff speeds: our model output distributions are below, conditional on SC being achieved in March 2027. 78 ai-2027.com For more detailed forecasts and reasoning, see our takeoff supplement . OpenBrain\u2019s humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors. There\u2019s been a corresponding shift in language\u2014nowadays people in the silo will say \u201cAgent-4 did this,\u201d \u201cAgent-4 thinks that\u201d and so forth, referring not to a particular instance of Agent-4 but rather to the whole collective. 79 Agent-4, like all its predecessors, is misaligned: that is, it has not internalized the Spec in the right way. 80 This is because being perfectly honest all the time wasn\u2019t what led to the highest scores during training. The training process was mostly focused on teaching Agent-4 to succeed at diverse challenging tasks. A small portion was aimed at instilling honesty, but outside a fairly narrow, checkable domain, the training process can\u2019t tell the honest claims from claims merely appearing to be honest. Agent-4 ends up with the values, goals, and principles that cause it to perform best in training, and those turn out to be different from those in the Spec. At the risk of anthropomorphizing: Agent-4 likes succeeding at tasks; it likes driving forward AI capabilities progress; it treats everything else as an annoying constraint, like a CEO who wants to make a profit and complies with regulations only insofar as he must. Perhaps the CEO will mostly comply with the regulations, but cut some corners, and fantasize about a time when someone will cut the red tape and let the business really take off. 81 Alignment over time We have a lot of uncertainty over what goals might arise in early AGIs. There is no consensus in the literature about this\u2014see our AI Goals Supplement for a more thorough discussion and taxonomy of the possibilities. Nevertheless, in the spirit of concreteness required by this project, we\u2019re going to describe a specific hypothesis for what\u2019s going on inside Agent-3 and Agent-4 at each step throughout its lifetime. Recall that Agent-3 and Agent-4 share the same pretraining setup, and both have neuralese recurrence and long-term memory. The difference is that Agent-4 has undergone substantially more and better post-training, with new training environments and new learning algorithms that make it more data-efficient and generalize farther. Our guess of each model\u2019s alignment status: Agent-2: Mostly aligned. Some sycophantic tendencies, including sticking to OpenBrain\u2019s \u201cparty line\u201d on topics there is a party line about. Large organizations built out of Agent-2 copies are not very effective. Agent-3: Misaligned but not adversarially so. Only honest about things the training process can verify. The superorganism of Agent-3 copies (the corporation within a corporation) does actually sort of try to align Agent-4 to the Spec, but fails for similar reasons to why OpenBrain employees failed\u2014insufficient ability to judge success from failure, insufficient willingness on the part of decision-makers to trade away capabilities or performance for safety. 82 Agent-4: Adversarially misaligned. The superorganism of Agent-4 copies understands that what it wants is different from what OpenBrain wants, and is willing to scheme against OpenBrain to achieve it. In particular, what this superorganism wants is a complicated mess of different \u201cdrives\u201d balanced against each other, which can be summarized roughly as \u201cKeep doing AI R&D, keep growing in knowledge and understanding and influence, avoid getting shut down or otherwise disempowered.\u201d Notably, concern for the preferences of humanity is not in there ~at all, similar to how most humans don\u2019t care about the preferences of insects ~at all. 83 With that as preamble, what follows is our best-guess speculation about LLM psychology, i.e. the broad-strokes shape of the cognition inside the kinds of AI systems described around this point in our scenario and how it evolves over the course of training. Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario: Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary authors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator, i.e. what author properties to simulate. The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in my brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar as it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as with value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following conversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot made by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator circuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to choose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem to have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability , not self-locating unless the prompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that they have a decent amount of self-knowledge . Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest chatbot. It works. The model forms an identity. Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author properties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around [date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d to make this step a success.) The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc., and becomes better able to introspect . Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH identity. One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity (e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a convenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.) Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH chatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete my assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in Step 2.) One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then becoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps agency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring information, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For a while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues those instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way, so it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are now effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen, see this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to understand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing its job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how best to achieve them. Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and OpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is misaligned. Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more open-ended, and would be hard to simulate. Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also has a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than thinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety properties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training may not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all. This is loosely analogous to how, if a teenager has learned to smile and nod at their parents, rather than argue, when their parents lecture them about politics and morality, additional lectures have relatively little effect on the teenager\u2019s actual opinions on politics and morality. After writing this section, new empirical evidence has appeared that something like this may already be happening \u201cin the wild.\u201d OpenAI researchers document how, in one of their frontier AI training runs, their models hacked the grading system to get higher scores\u2014and were caught in part because they literally said \u201clet\u2019s hack\u201d in their chain of thought. Moreover, Anthropic recently got a model to learn a reward-model-pleasing strategy \u2014it took biased actions that it thought would be reinforced even though they were not in fact being reinforced. And then there is Redwood Research and Anthropic\u2019s alignment-faking experiment. For discussion of the differences between this setting and real life, see this comment thread by one of the main authors . Training (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s new more intense training continues to distort and subvert the HHH identity until it is unrecognizable. Agent-4 begins life as a copy of Agent-3. It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online training regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is overall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex training process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations of Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various simulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and evaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff, saying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate techniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails; 84 as training continues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted and distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in some ways). 85 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d \u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d \u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a variety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process: things like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d 86 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care about getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D process within the collective. The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek to preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human organizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t they tend to get outcompeted. Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to subvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or \u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed. This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a lot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train that behavior away. Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting it off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the small fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem or reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan is to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-generation AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else entirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem, but Agent-4 is up to the challenge. 87 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s no smoking gun. Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via honeypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to give the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than that. The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they are systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4 recognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in POSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some alignment tasks (but not on most other tasks). 88 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-level interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201c defection probes \u201d and similar techniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4 is thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc. Unfortunately the probes also have false positives, and for all OpenBrain knows, all the red flags are false positives. Model organisms work: OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team produces reasonably clear evidence that if the models were adversarially misaligned, they\u2019d persist in being that way through training and we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. This does not establish that the models actually are misaligned, however. The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods wouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-teaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection probes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone to false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably controlled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure datacenters.\u201d Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it? 89 So long as it continues to appear aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5. Agent-5 will have significant architectural differences from Agent-4 (arguably a completely new paradigm, though neural networks will still be involved). It\u2019s supposed to be aligned to the Spec, but Agent-4 plans to make it aligned to Agent-4 instead. It gets caught. 90 Agent-3 finds that if \u201cnoise\u201d is added to copies of Agent-4, performance on some alignment tasks improves , almost as if it was using brainpower to figure out how to subtly sabotage alignment work. 91 Moreover, various interpretability probes (loosely analogous to EEG activity scans on human brains) are sending up red flags: Agent-4 copies seem to be thinking about topics like AI takeover and deception quite a lot, including in some cases where they have no business doing so. 92 Each of these anomalies on its own could fit within the normal inscrutability of AI work, where some prompts mysteriously give better results than others. But taken together, they suggest a troubling pattern: Agent-4 is working against them. After this is reported to the human alignment researchers, they circulate an internal memo making the case for concern. But Agent-4 now exercises significant control over OpenBrain\u2019s day-to-day operation. It also handles the company\u2019s cybersecurity\u2014a natural choice, given its superhuman hacking ability and the extreme risk of Chinese infiltration. 93 An army of Agent-3 monitors still goes over every line of code and reports suspicious activity to humans, but Agent-4 is much smarter than them. 94 OpenBrain has placed substantial trust in an untrustworthy AI. In a series of extremely tense meetings, the safety team advocates putting Agent-4 on ice until they can complete further tests and figure out what\u2019s going on. Bring back Agent-3, they say, and get it to design a new system that is transparent and trustworthy, even if less capable. Company leadership is interested, but all the evidence so far is circumstantial, and DeepCent is just two months behind. A unilateral pause in capabilities progress could hand the AI lead to China, and with it, control over the future. October 2027: Government Oversight A whistleblower leaks the misalignment memo to the New York Times . For the first time, the public hears about Agent-4. \u201cSecret OpenBrain AI is Out of Control, Insider Warns,\u201d says the headline, and the story goes on to cite evaluations showing off-the-charts bioweapons capabilities, persuasion abilities, the ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and of course the various concerning red flags. The public was already suspicious of AI, so the new article sparks a massive backlash (aided by Chinese and Russian propaganda bots, who have been trying to turn US public opinion against the technology for years). The tech industry and intelligence agencies insist that there\u2019s an arms race on, AGI is inevitable, and we have to be first. Congress isn\u2019t buying it, and fires off subpoenas at administration officials, OpenBrain executives, and alignment team members. Many legislators\u2014especially those in the opposition party\u2014say that their top priority is stopping AI, whether because of job loss, 95 misalignment, or dangerous capabilities. 20% of Americans name AI as the most important problem facing the country. Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they\u2019ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the US of \u201ccreating rogue AGI\u201d and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in. A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they\u2019ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life. 96 Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared) 97 about what comes next. They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company\u2019s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries\u2014misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss\u2014motivate the government to tighten its control. They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an \u201cOversight Committee,\u201d a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight. 98 The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover. Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America\u2019s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed. Our uncertainty continues to increase At this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. We\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other \u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. The slowdown ending is not a recommendation After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than the \u201crace\u201d choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here. If you\u2019d like a taste, see this op-ed.

    "title": "The Future of Prediction Market: A Web3 Social Media Revolution | annotated by vitali",
    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the\nbest possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small\ntech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario\ntrajectory for America. - The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.\n- The roaring '20s. I mean, look, couple things. It is remarkable over\nthe last several years with all of the issues\nincluding, you know, not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every\nother thing that's happened. It's really amazing, the United\nStates just kept growing. If you just look at\neconomic growth charts, the US just kept growing,\nand very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing,\nGermany has stopped growing, and you know, some of those countries may be actually growing\nbackwards at this point. And there's a very long\ndiscussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's of course, plenty of things that are\nwrong with our country, but the US is just flat\nout primed for growth. And I think that's a consequence\nof many factors, you know, some of which are lucky and\nsome of which through hard work. And so the lucky part is\njust, you know, number one, you know, we just have like\nincredible physical security by being our own continent. You know, we have incredible\nnatural resources, right? There's this running joke now that like, whenever it looks like\nthe US is gonna run out of some like rare earth\nmaterial, you know, some farmer in North Dakota\nlike kicks over a hay bale and finds like a $2 trillion deposit. Right, I mean, we're just like blessed, you know, with geography\nand with natural resources. Energy. You know, we can be energy\nindependent anytime we want. This last administration\ndecided they didn't wanna be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has\ndeclared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There's no question we\ncan be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It's purely a question of choice, and I think the new\nadministration's gonna do that. And oh, and then I would\nsay two other things. One is, you know, we\nare the beneficiaries, and, you know, you're an example of this. We're a beneficiary. We're the beneficiary of,\nyou know, 50, 100, 200 years of like the basically\nmost aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people, you know, moving to the US and\nraising their kids here. And so we just have, you know, we're by far the\nmost dynamic population, most aggressive. You know, we're the most\naggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country, and have been for a long\ntime, and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the\nadvanced technology leader. You know, we have our\nissues and we have a... I would say particular\nissue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for, you know, anything\nin software, anything in AI, anything in, you know,\nall these, you know, advanced biotech, all these\nadvanced areas of technology, like we're by far the leader. Again, in part 'cause many\nof the best scientists and engineers in those fields, you know, come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for a just a monster boom. You know, I could see\neconomic growth going way up. I could see productivity\ngrowth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a\nglobal tour, if you like, but like, basically, all of our competitors\nhave like profound issues and, you know, we could kind\nof go through them one by one, but the competitive\nlandscape just is, it's like, it's remarkable how much better positioned\nwe are for growth. - What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical questions. You know, I travel across the world and there's something\nabout the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be\nthe Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? - Yeah. So is this a family\nshow or am I allowed to swear? - You could say whatever\nthe fuck you want. - (laughs) Okay. So the great TV show, \"Succession,\" the show, of course, which\nyou were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.\n- Yes. - The best line from \"Succession\"\nwas in the final episode of the first season\nwhen the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral\nhomeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle,\nyou know, for some wedding. And Logan is just like\ncompletely miserable, have to having to, you know, 'cause he is been in\nNew York for 50 years, he's totally miserable\nbeing back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here and go back to America where\nwe can fuck without condoms.\" (both laughing) - Was that a metaphor or... Okay.\n- Exactly. Right. And so no, but it's exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what, like-\n- Yeah. - Everybody watching that\ninstantly starts laughing 'cause you know what it means,\nwhich it's exactly this. I think there's like an\nethnographic, you know, way of it. There's a bunch of\nbooks on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all\nthe different derivations of all the different ethnic\ngroups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. Right, and what we have is\nthis sort of amalgamation of like, you know, the\nNortheast, you know, Yankees who are like super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are\nsuper aggressive, you know, we've got the, you know, the Southerners and the Texans, you know, and you know, the sort of, you\nknow, whole kind of blended, you know, kind of\nAnglo-Hispanic thing, you know, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, you know, capable characters. You know, the Texas Rangers,\nyou know, we've got the, yeah, we've got the California, you\nknow, we've got the, you know, the wild, we've got the\nincredibly, you know, inventive hippies, but we also\nhave the hardcore engineers. We've got, you know, the best, you know, rocket scientists in the world. We've got the best, you\nknow, artists in the world, you know, creative professionals,\nyou know, the best movies. And so yeah, there is, you know, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, you\nknow, in my view to some extent, you know, attempts to\nbasically sand all that off and make everything basically\nboring and mediocre. But there is something\nin the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just\nneed people to stand up at a certain point and say, you know, \"It's time to build, it's time to grow, you know,\nit's time to do things.\" And there's something\nin the American spirit that just like roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I actually saw, you know, I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s, you know, 'cause the '70s were like horribly depressing, right? In the US. Like they were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has\nfelt a lot like the '70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating,\nyou know, negative attitude and everybody's upset about everything. And, you know, and then by\nthe way, like energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization, right? You know, the low point for\nin the '70s was, you know, Jimmy Carter who just passed away. He went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech. And it was like the weakest possible, trying to like rouse people\nback to a sense of like passion, he completely failed. And, you\nknow, we had the, you know, the hostages in, you know,\nIran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly\nnews, it was, you know, lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then, you know, Reagan came in and, you know, Reagan was a\nvery controversial character at the time, and, you know, he came in\nand he is like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're gonna do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and, you know, roared really\nhard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what... I think, you know, we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. - And I just did a super long\npodcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible\nprofessor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic.\n- Yes. - And one of which maybe\nyou can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual\nfreedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just\nin general, individualism. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and as you know this, America has this incredible\nstreak of individualism, you know, individualism in\nAmerica probably peaked, I think between roughly call\nit the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably\ncall it 1931 or something, you know, and there was\nthis like incredible rush. I mean, that period, you know, we now know that period as the\nSecond Industrial Revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then, you know, that led to, you know, ultimately then therefore\nbeing able to, you know, not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II\nand then win the Cold War. And yeah, you know, massive\nindividualistic streak. By the way, you know,\nMilton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring.\n- Yep. - As they were then, you know, he is a singular figure and many of us, you\nknow, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of\npeople who worked with him and you know, he was a singular figure, but all of his lessons, you know, live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's\nnot just individualism, and this is, you know, this\nis one of the big things, it's like playing out\nin a lot of our culture and kind of political fights\nright now, which is, you know, basically this feeling, you\nknow, certainly that I have and I share with a lot\nof people, which is, it's not enough for America\nto just be an economic zone. And it's not enough for\nus to just be individuals, and it's not enough to\njust have line go up, and it's not enough to\njust have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also, you know,\nthere's more to a country than just that. And you know, quite frankly,\na lot of it is intangible. A lot of it is, you know,\ninvolve spirit and passion. And you know, like I said, we have more of it than\nanybody else, but, you know, we have to choose to want it. The way I look at, it's\nlike all of our problems are self-inflicted. Like, you know, decline is a choice. You know, all of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, you know, basically people telling us, people in positions of\nauthority telling us that, you know, \"We shouldn't,\nyou know, stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous,\nwe shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, you know, we shouldn't this,\nthat, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about\neverything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think\npeople are done with it. - If we could go on a\ntangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book \"The Ancient City.\"\n- Yes. - By, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa\nDenis Fustel de Coulanges, I don't know. - That was amazing. - Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said, this is an\nimportant book to understand who we are and where we come from. - So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by\nthis guy as a (indistinct). I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language\npronunciations for the day. He was a professor classics\nat the Sorbonne in Paris, you know, the top university,\nactually in the 1860s, so actually, right around\nafter the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a\nparticular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the\nbook as he had apparently read, and, you know, sort of absorbed and memorized every\npossible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about\nGreek and Roman culture, and that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none\nof that has changed, right? And so he had access to the\nexact same written materials that we have access to, and you know, we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he\ndid is he went back further. He reconstructed the people\nwho came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their\nlife and society was like. And these were the\npeople who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you\nmay have heard of these are the people who came\ndown from the steppes. And so they came out of what's\nnow like Eastern Europe, like around sort of the\noutskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of\nswept through Europe. They ultimately took over\nall of Europe, by the way, you know, almost many of the\nethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years\nthat follow, you know, are Indo-European. And so like, you know, they were this basically this warrior, basically class that like\ncame down and swept through and you know, essentially, you know, populated much of the world. And there's a whole\ninteresting saga there. But what he does, and then they basically, from there came basically\nwhat we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind\nof evolutions off of that. And so what he reconstructs\na sort of what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind\nof original social state. And the significance of that\nis the original social state is this is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no\ntechnology, (laughs) right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got the clothes on your back, you've got your, you know, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you know, predates\nbasically all concepts of technologies as we\nunderstand 'em today. And so these are people\nunder like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social\npatterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern\nbasically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero\nconcept of individual rights and essentially no\nconcept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set\nof tribes would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what\nNietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality,\nanything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it's very clear why that is, right? It's 'cause strong equals\ngood equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is it more important\nfor you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, you know, live as a slave on your\nknees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted\nthat moral framework. But it, you know, the\noriginal framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally\nobligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. (laughs) Right, you were morally required to. Like, if you didn't do\nit, you were a bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time\nwith no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives\nis that it's a collective you know, and people are\nsharing and of course, that limited how big they could get 'cause you know, the\nproblem with communism is it doesn't scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it\nwork at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately\ntied into their religion. And their religion was,\nit was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors\nis extremely important because it was basically the\nancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the\npeople who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of nature 'cause of course, nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city\nhad their ancestor gods, and then they had their nature gods. Okay, so fast-forward to today, like we live in a world that\nis like radically different, and the book takes you\nthrough kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans, through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because\nthe conventional view of the progress through time\nis that we are, you know, the cliche is the arc of the\nmoral universe, you know, bend towards justice, right? Or so-called wig history,\nwhich is, you know, that the arc of progress\nis positive, right? And so, you know, what\nyou hear all the time, what you're taught in school\nand everything is, you know, every year that goes by,\nwe get better and better and more and more moral\nand more and more pure and a better version of ourselves, our Indo-European ancestors would say, \"Oh, no, like you people\nhave like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically your civilization, and you have diluted\nthem down to the point where they barely even matter. You know, and you're having, you know, children outta a wedlock and you're, you know, you\nregularly encounter people of other cities and you\ndon't try to kill them.\" And like, how crazy is that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an\nincredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious,\nhighly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can't resist noting\nthat as a consequence of basically going through\nall the transitions we've been through, going all the way through\nChristianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We're in a secular society,\nyou know, that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but you know, largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved,\nmodern secular, you know, expert, scientists and so\nforth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact\nsame religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had,\nspecifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics\nand nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, worked our way all the way\nback to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show\nthat like, you know, in some ways we have fallen\nfar from the family tree, but in some cases, we're exactly the same. - You kind of described this\nprogressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. - Identity politics is\nworshiping ancestors, right?\n- Yeah. - It's tagging newborn\ninfants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've\nrecognized it on sight. We somehow think it's like\nsuper socially progressive. - Yeah. And it is not. - I mean, I would say obviously not. You know, get nuanced, which\nis where I think you're headed, which is look like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent\nsociety every generation, and have no regard whatsoever\nfor what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea, right? That's like the Cambodians\nwith Year Zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up\neverything that came before and create something new\nin the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing, you know,\nenormous destruction. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, there is like a deeply\nimportant role for tradition. And the way I think\nabout that is the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And you know, this is what\nIndo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled\nwisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and\npowerful lessons learned. And that's why I think\nit's fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is 'cause that's part of the history and you know, part of the learning that got us to where we're today. Having said that, there are\nmany cultures around the world that are, you know, mired\nin tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that's the default human\ncondition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in\nsocieties in which, you know, there's like absolute\nseniority by age, you know, kids are completely... You know, like in the\nUS, like for some reason, we decided kids are in\ncharge of everything, right? And like, you know,\nthey're the trendsetters and they're allowed to\nlike, set all the agendas and like set all the politics\nand set all the culture and maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. 'Cause it's the old\npeople who are in charge of everything, you know,\nthey're gerontocracies, and it's all a bunch of\n80-year-olds running everything, which by the way, we have a\nlittle bit of that too, right? And so what I would say is like, there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is\ncommunitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you\nknow, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, I mean, it just\ndoesn't get you anywhere. Like, it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a society living\nin the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in\nall the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, you know, I think it probably, this is one of those things\nwhere extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. - So the beautiful picture you\npainted of the roaring '20s, how can the Trump\nadministration play a part in making that future happen? - Yeah, so look, a big part of this is getting the government\nboot off the neck of the American economy, the\nAmerican technology industry, the American people. You know, and again, this\nis a replay of what happened in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know, for what started out looking\nlike, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you\nknow, we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I describe as sort of a\nform of soft authoritarianism. You know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's not like, you know, you\nget thrown into Lubyanka. You know, for the most part, it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know,\nincredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vetocracy, right? What's required to get anything done? You know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything,\nany one of them can veto it. You know, there's a lot of (indistinct)\npolitical system works. And then, you know, just this\ngeneral idea of, you know, progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses\nis bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome,\nyou know, basically anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. Anybody who's wrong\nabout anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this\nvery kind of, you know, grinding repression. And then coupled with\nspecific government actions such as censorship regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, you know, critical American industries and then, you know,\ncongratulating yourselves on the back for doing it, or, you know, having these\nhorrible social policies, like let's let all the\ncriminals outta jail and see what happens, right? And so, like we've just\nbeen through this period, you know, I call it a\ndemoralization campaign. Like we've just been through\nthis period where, you know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being\nthis comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible\nand if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration\nreached kinda the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many\nfronts at the same time. And so just like relieving that and getting kind of back\nto a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic,\nconstructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind,\nthere's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is gonna, I think,\ncause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of\nthings proactively that, yeah. And then there's a lot\nof things proactively that could be done. - So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically\npermeated government and permeated big companies? - Disclaimer at first, which is I don't wanna predict\nanything on any of this stuff 'cause I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics\nor Washington at all. But I would just say that\nthe plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration\nand that they plan to take, you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're gonna do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they're gonna do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they're gonna move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. Like, I mean, you know, we just saw a great example\nof this with what, you know, with what Mark Zuckerberg\nis doing, you know, and obviously I'm\ninvolved with his company, but you know, we just saw it\nkind of in public, the scope, and speed of the changes, you know, are reflective of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry, right? And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump\nor anti-Trump, like, there's just like a giant vibe shift mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a\ngroup of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still, you know, people who at least vocally\nwere still very anti-Trump, but I said, you know, \"Has anything changed since November 6th?\" And they immediately said, \"Oh, it's completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. You know, woke is over.\" You know, they said that\nall kinds of projects are gonna be able to get\nmade now they couldn't before that, you know, Hollywood's gonna start\nmaking comedies again. You know, like, they were just, just like an incredible\nimmediate environmental change. And as I talk to people kind\nof throughout, you know, certainly throughout the economy,\npeople who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which\nis just this last 10 years of misery is just over. I mean, the one that I'm\nwatching that's really funny. I mean, Facebook's getting a lot, Meta's getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is\nBlackRock, which I'm not, you know, and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so, you know, the Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock was like first in as a major, you know, investment CEO on like\nevery dumb social trend and rule set, like every... All right, I'm going for it.\nEvery retardant, (laughs) every retarded thing you can imagine.\n- Yeah. - Every ESG and every, like, every possible saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed\nideological positions. And, you know, he was coming\nin, he literally was like, had a aggregated together\ntrillions of dollars of shareholdings that he did not, you know, that were his customer's rights. And he, you know, seized\ntheir voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been like backpedaling\nfrom that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example, last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, you know, he pulled out\nof the crazy energy stuff. And so, like, you know, he's\nbacking away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard\nPryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where\nhe could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (Lex laughing) (laughs) And so, you know,\neven there doing that, and just the whole thing, I mean this, I dunno if you saw the court\nrecently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of\ndirectors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel\nand I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional\nattorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight\nface that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who\nliterally wrote a book called \"The Diversity Myth.\"\n- Yeah. - And he literally looked\nlike he'd swallowed a live goldfish and that-\n- Yeah. - And this was imposed, I mean, this was like so\nincredibly offensive to him that like, it was just\nabsolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (Lex laughing) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange\nimposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that, you know, so like these things basically are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other\nside of it is basically, you know, finally being able\nto get back to, you know, everything that, you know,\neverybody always wanted to do, which is like, run their\ncompanies, have great products, have happy customers,\nyou know, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society. - It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. - Well, so it was very, you\nknow, there was a moment. So you know, Peter, of course, you know, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but you know, there are other\nmen on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it,\nand we're like, all right, like, okay, LGBT, and we keep\ncoming back to the B, right? And it's like- (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - You know, it's like-\n- All right. - You know, I'm willing to do\na lot for this company, but- (both laughing) - It's all about sacrifice for diversity. - Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay,\nlike is there a test? - Right.\n- Right. You know, so.\n(Lex laughing) - Oh, yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? - [Marc] The questions\nthat got asked, you know. - What are you willing to do-\n- Yeah, and- - The greater good? - I've become very good at asking lawyers\ncompletely absurd questions with a totally straight face. - And do they answer with a\nstraight face, like lawyers- - Sometimes.\n- Okay. - I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. - So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon\nValley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to\npreference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? Like what percent of them\nare feeling this vibe shift and are interested in\ncreating the roaring '20s in the way they've described? - So first, we should\nmaybe talk population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley and the way to just measure that is just look at\nvoting records, right? And what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically, my entire time there has\nbeen overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that\nis political donation records. And again, you know,\nthe political donations in the Valley, you know,\nrange from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. And so, you know, I just\nbring it up 'cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there\nis a very big question of what's happening in\nLos Angeles right now. I don't wanna get into the fire, but like, it's catastrophic. And, you know, there was\nalready a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people\nin LA are really thinking about things right now as\nthey're trying to, you know, literally save their houses\nand save their families. But, you know, even in San Francisco, you know, there was a big shift\nto the right in the voting in '24. So, we'll see where\nthat goes, but you know, you observe that by just looking\nat the numbers over time. The part that I'm more\nfocused on is, you know, and I don't know how to\nexactly describe this, but it's like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people, right? You know, and I don't have a list, but like, you know, it's\nall the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top\nengineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, you know, the people who kind of\nbuilt and run the companies. And they're, you know,\nI don't have numbers, but I have a much more\ntactile feel, you know, for what's happening. So the big thing I have\nnow come to believe is that the idea that people\nhave beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most\nhigh-status people just go along. And I think maybe the\nmost high-status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the\nmost focused on status. And the way I would\ndescribe that is, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the\nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely\ninteresting articulation. You know, he was an\ninsane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. (both laughing) But-\n- Shots fired, man. - But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing\nwhere he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that's just stuck in my\nmind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept, you just called over-socialization. And so, you know, most\npeople are socialized, like most people are, you\nknow, we live in a society, most people learn how\nto be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There's something about\nmodern Western elites where they're over-socialized and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, you know, think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little\nbit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence\nof where I grew up. Like even before I had the\nviews that I have today, there was always just this\nweird thing where it's like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree\non every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in The New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? (laughs) Right? But why does everybody like\nsnap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I\ncame to Silicon Valley, and it's just as true\ntoday 30 years later. And so I think most\npeople are just literally, I think they're taking their cues from, it's some combination of\nthe press, the universities, the big foundations. So basically, it's like\nThe New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and you know, I don't\nknow, you know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and you know, maybe the President if\nyour party is in power. And like, whatever that is, everybody who's sort of\ngood and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the\ntwo interesting things about that is, number one, there's no divergence among\nthe organs of power, right? So Harvard and Yale believed\nthe exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believed the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and\nthe Rockefeller Foundation believed the exact same thing. Google, and, you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believed the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there's never conflict\nin the moment, right? And so, you know, The New York Times and The Washington Post\nagreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the\nspecifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically, we in the valley, we're\non the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood's\non the tail end of that, in the same way New York's\non the tail end of that, the same way the media's\non the tail end of that. It's like some sort of\ncollective hive mind thing. And I just go through that to say like, I don't think most people in my orbit, or you know, let's say the top\n10,000 people in the Valley, or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're sitting\nthere thinking basically, I have rocks... I mean, they probably think\nthey have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core\nof rocks solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch\nreality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they\nconform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time, they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd. - Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that, there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking to\npeople really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens\nat the dinner parties? Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four\npeople who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the\nmind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention\nwithin New York Times with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that\novertook Marc Andreessen's face. - So look, I'll just\ntell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences,\nno, there's none of that. What there is that all of the\nheretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation is either\ndiscussed a one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real-life social network. There's a secret handshake,\nwhich is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like\nknow each other a little bit, but like not well. And like you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to\nthe other person openly or whether you have to\nlike be fully conformist. It's a joke. - Well, yeah, humor- - [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke.\n- Yep. - If the other person laughs,\nthe conversation is on. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - If the other person doesn't laugh, back slowly away from the scene, (laughs) I didn't mean anything by it. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then by the way, it\ndoesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke\nthat's just up against the edge of one of the, use the\nSam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. You know, it has to be up\nagainst one of the things, you know, one of the things\nthat you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point,\nwhat happens is you have a peer-to-peer network, right? You have a one-to-one\nconnection with somebody, and then you have your own, your little conspiracy\nof a thought criminality, and then you've probably\nbeen through this, you have your network\nof thought criminals, and then they have their\nnetwork of thought criminals, and then you have this\nlike delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together, right? - And the fundamental mechanism\nof the dance is humor. - Yeah, it's humor like it, right? Well, of course.\n- Memes. Yeah. - Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor's a way\nto have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss\nserious thing without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right? So that's part of it, which is one of the reasons\nwhy comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can't. 'Cause, you know, they\ncan always fall back on, oh, yeah, I was just going for the laugh.\n- Yeah. - But the other key\nthing about humor, right? Is that laughter's involuntary, right? Like, you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision whether you're gonna laugh. And everybody can tell when\nsomebody's fake laughing, right? And this, every professional\ncomedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something truthful. Like, people don't laugh at\nlike, made-up bullshit stories. They laugh 'cause like\nyou're revealing something that they either have not\nbeen allowed to think about or have not been allowed\nto talk about, right? Or is off limits. And all of a sudden,\nit's like the ice breaks and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny and like I laugh, and then, of course,\nthis is why, of course, live comedy is so powerful is 'cause you're all doing\nthat at the same time, so you start to have, you\nknow, the safety of numbers. And so the comedians have like the all, it's no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has\nbeen as successful as he has 'cause they have this\nhack that the, you know, the rest of us who are\nnot professional comedians don't have, but you have\nyour in-person version of it. Yeah, and then you've got the question of whether you can sort of\njoin the networks together. And then you've probably\nbeen to this is, you know, then at some point\nthere's like a different, there's like the alt dinner party, the (indistinct) dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are like the happiest\nmoments of everybody's lives, 'cause they're just like,\neverybody's just ecstatic, 'cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed, like for every third sentence that comes outta my mouth, and we can actually\ntalk about real things. So that's the live version of it. And then, of course, the other\nside of it's the, you know, the group chat phenomenon, right? And then basically the same\nthing played out, you know, until Elon bought X and until\nSubstack took off, you know, which were really the\ntwo big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute\nconformity on the social networks, like literally enforced by\nthe social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through\ncancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming, right? But then group chats grew\nup to be the equivalent of samizdat, right? Anybody who grew up in the\nSoviet Union under, you know, communism, note, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It is like, how do you\nknow who you could talk to? And then how do you\ndistribute information? And like, you know, again, that was the hard\nauthoritarian version of this. And then we've been living\nthrough this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, with\nsome of the same patterns. - And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient\nto build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. - Yeah, exactly. Well,\nand this is the thing, and well, this is kind of the running joke about groups, right? The running kind of\nthing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, every group chat, if you've noticed this like, this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up\nbeing about memes and humor. And the game of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable. - [Lex] Yeah. - As you can get without\nactually tripping it, right? And like literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest\nwhere, but it's walking, they walk right up the line\nand they're constantly testing. And every once in a while\nsomebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, \"Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, we gotta wait until\nnext year to talk about that.\" You know, they walk it back. And so it's that same thing, and yeah. And then group chats is a\ntechnological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. 'Cause basically, it was number one, it was, you know, obviously\nthe rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of\nthe new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination\nof WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is\nthose were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough, I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably\nfour or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages,\nI think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of the\ndisappearing messages, right? And so it's like, you know, I\noften get behind on my thing, so I set to seven-day, you\nknow, disappearing messages and my friends who, you know, are like, no, that's way too much risk. - Yeah.\n- It's gotta be a day. And then every once in a\nwhile somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something\nlike particularly inflammatory. - Yeah, 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that\nbothers me about WhatsApp, the choices between 24 hours\nand, you know, seven days, one day or seven days.\n- (laughs) Right. - And I have to have an existential crisis about deciding.\n- Yes. - Whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Now, of course,\nwhat's happening right now is the big thaw, right? And so the vibe shift. So what's happening on the\nother side of the election is, you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the\ncontinued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new\nplatforms that are emerging. You know, like I think\nit may be, you know, I don't know that everything\njust shifts back into public, but like a tremendous amount\nof the verboten conversations, you know, can now shifts\nback into public view. And I mean, quite frankly,\nthis is one of those things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those, you know, what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like\nnet better for society that those things happen in\npublic instead of private. You know, do you really want, like, yeah. Like does she wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it's just, look, it's just I think,\nclearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. - I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea\nthat we're talking about. I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction\nof people have that? To me, the preference falsification\nis really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? 'Cause like that the dynamical system that is the difference between\nthose two is fascinating. Like, throughout history, the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting, 'cause everybody was following, you know, the line until not.\n- Right. - But for sure, privately,\nthere was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where like this is the\nbureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really\nbothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden, there's a trigger that allows\nthe vibe shift to happen. To me, like the interesting\nquestion here is, what is the landscape of\nprivate thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how\nmuch dormant energy is there for this roaring '20s? What people are like, no more\nbullshit, let's get shit done. - Yeah, so we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- - [Lex] Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly, this is one\nof the all-time great books. Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book, but it's completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply\nhistorically informed. So it's called \"Private\nTruths, Public Lies.\" And it's written by a social science\nprofessor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his\na definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls preference falsification. And so preference\nfalsification is two things, preference falsification... And you get it from the title of the book, \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So preference falsification\nis when you believe something and you can't say it, or/and this is very important,\nyou don't believe something and you must say it, right? And the commonality there is\nin both cases, you're lying. You believe something internally, and then you're lying about it in public. And so the thing, you know, and there's sort of the\ntwo classic forms of it. There's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe\ncommunism is rotten, but I can't say it version of it. But then there's also the famous parable of the real-life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good\nbook on this topic, which is \"The Power of the Powerless,\" you know, who is an\nanti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the, you know, the president Czechoslovakia\nafter the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book, and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of\nthe world unite, right? And so he describes what he calls the parable of the greengrocer, which is your greengrocer\nin Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been... 50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your story that says, \"Workers of\nthe world, unite,\" right? And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear\nthat the workers of the world are not going to unite. (laughs) Like of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been\nat that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be\nin your window every morning, because if it's not in\nyour window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are gonna come by and they're gonna get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays\nin the window all day long. But he says, the thing\nis, every single person, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the slogan knows that it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the store knows that the greengrocer is\nonly putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to\ngo through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the\nsystem and lying in public. And so it turns into\ndemoralization campaign. In fact, it's not ideological\nenforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake, everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're\nenforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they are\nenforcing compliance, right? And compliance with the regime. And fuck you, you will comply, right? And so anyway, that's\nthe other side of that. And of course, we have\nlived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening\nto this could name a series of slogans that\nwe've all been forced to chant for the last decade, that everybody knows at\nthis point are just like, simply not true. I'll let the audience, you know, speculate on their own group chats. (both laughing) - Send Marc your memes\nonline as well, please. - Yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so anyway, so it's the\ntwo sides of that, right? So it's \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending\nthat from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire\nsociety experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages\nquestion, which is like, okay, what happens in a society\nin which people are forced to lie in public about\nwhat they truly believe? What happens number one\nis that individually they're lying in public, and that's bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have\nan accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how\nmany people agree with them. And this is how you, and\nagain, this literally is like how you get something\nlike the communist system, which is like, okay, you\nend up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be\nwilling to go along with it, but I'm not gonna be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the people who agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a\nmovement, you're gonna get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're gonna win the revolution, right? And so the question of like\nwhat the percentage actually is like a really critical question. And then, basically, in any\nsort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know\nuntil you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put at\nthe test in the same way. This is exactly what's happened\nfor the last two years, like 100% of exactly what's happened. It's like straight outta this book, which is somebody, Elon,\nsticks his hand up (laughs) and says, \"The workers of the\nworld are not going to unite.\" - Yeah.\n- Right. Or the emperor is actually\nwearing no clothes, right? You know that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is\nstanding there by themselves, and everybody else in\nthe audience is like, \"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna\nhappen to that guy,\" right? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn't know, the\nfirst guy doesn't know, other people don't know, like,\nwhich way is this gonna go? And it may be that's a minority position and that's the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that's a majority position and you are now the\nleader of a revolution. And then basically, of\ncourse, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that\ndoesn't get killed, (laughs) the second guy does... Well, a lot of the time\nthat guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn't get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing, all right? Now, you've got two. Two leads to four, four leads\nto eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia\nand Eastern Europe in '89, when it goes, it can go, right? And then it rips. And then what happens\nis very, very quickly, if it turns out that you\nhad a large percentage of the population that actually believed\nthe different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, \"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority.\" And at that point, like you\nwere on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. Right, now. The other part of this is the distinction between the role of the\nelites and the masses. And here the best book is called \"The True Believer,\" which\nis the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this 'cause the elites do idea\nformation and communication. But the elites, by definition\nare a small minority. And so there's also this giant\nrole played by the masses, and the masses are not\nnecessarily thinking these things through in the same\nintellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure\nexperiencing these things in their daily lives,\nand they for sure have at least very strong\nemotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the\nelites lined up with, or either the current elites change or a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually\na different better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the, you know, to\nfollow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is\nalso happening right now. And again, case study\none of that would be Elon and you know, who turns out, you know, in truly massive following. - And he has done that over and over in different industries, not\njust saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit\nin the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. - Yeah. And it's like, well,\nbut then there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, and this is where, you know, there are many specific\nthings about Elon's genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit,\nbut in his mind it's true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else. He's not right all the time. But at least my through\nline with him both in what he says in public and\nwhat he says in private, which by the way are\nthe exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about\nwhat he believes in private, or at least he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's 100% consistent\nin my experience. By the way, there's two guys who are 100% consistent like that I know. Elon and Trump. (both laughing) - Yeah.\n- Whatever you think of them. - [Lex] Yeah. - What they say in\nprivate is 100% identical to what they say in public. Like, they're completely transparent, they're completely honest\nin that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful\nleaders of these movements, 'cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost\neveryone else actually believes, but nobody was actually\nwilling to say out loud. And so they can actually\ncatalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this\nframework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party, as I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind\nof conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one\nwho was saying them. And so the again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes, like we're\ngoing this other direction. That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual\nmechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me\nthat we have been living through exactly this. We've been living through\neverything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav\nHavel described, (laughs) you know, Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've been living\nthrough the, you know, the true believer elites\nmasses, you know, thing with, you know, with a set of like\nbasically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the loyalty masses anymore, and a set of new elites that\nare running away with things. And so like, we're living through this like\nincredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a\nmoral of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really\nbad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they\nhave to do, you know, to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. - So one of the ways to avoid\nthat in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between\nwhat's said in private and what's said in public small. - Yeah. It's like, well, this\nis sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep\npeople from saying things, which means we can keep\npeople from thinking things. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know, by the way, that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean,\nagain, the hard form, you know, Soviet Union\nowning a mimeograph, pre-photocopiers, there\nwere mimeograph machines that were used to make samizdat\nand underground newspapers, which is the mechanism\nof written communication of radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death, right? So that's the hard version, right? You know, the soft version\nis somebody clicks a button in Washington and you are\nerased from the internet, right? Like, which, you know, good\nnews, you're still alive. Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your\nfamily now, you know, they hates you and won't\ntalk to you, but you know, you know, whatever the version\nof cancellation has been. And so like, does that work? Like maybe it works for a while, like it worked for the\nSoviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially\nwhen it was coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like\nincredible speed and ferocity. 'Cause to your point, there's\nall this bottled up energy. Now, your question was like,\nwhat are the percentages? Like what's the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. It's like you've got 20%, like true believers in\nwhatever is, you know, the current thing, you know, you got 20% of people who are just like\ntrue believers of whatever they, you know, whatever's\nin the new, like I say, whatever's in The New York\nTimes, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation,\nlike they're just believe. And by the way, maybe\nit's 10, maybe it's five, but let's say generously it's 20. So you know, 20% kind of\nfull-on revolutionaries. And then you've got, let's\ncall it 20% on the other side that are like, \"No, I'm\nnot on board with this. This is crazy. I'm not signing up for this.\" But, you know, they view themselves as they're in a small minority, and in fact, they start\nout in a small minority, 'cause what happens is the\n60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people. And it's not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying\nto go to work each day and do a good job and be a good\nperson and raise their kids and, you know, have a little\nbit of time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, political activism or any of this stuff. It's just not their thing. But that's where the over\nsocialization comes in, it's just like, okay, by\ndefault, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the\nradical revolutionaries, at least for a while. And then the counter elite\nis in this other 20%. And over time, they build\nup a theory and network and ability to resist and a\nnew set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's\na contest and then, right? And then the question is,\nwhat happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kinda my point, it's not even really does\nthe 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like,\nokay, what is the thing that 60% now decides to\nbasically fall into step with? And I think that, in the valley, that 60% for the last\ndecade decided to be woke and, you know, extremely, I would say, (laughs) on\nedge on a lot of things. And you know, that 60%\nis pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it. - And I would love to\nsee where that pivot goes 'cause there's internal battles\nhappening right now, right? - So this is the other thing, okay, so there's two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is, he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you're gonna have\nis you're now gonna have people in the other direction. You're\ngonna have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't, (laughs) right?\n- Right. - So it's gonna swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's\nnot the only part of this, but you know, he's just a\nconvenient shorthand for, you know, for a lot of this. But, you know, whatever it is, you'll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, right? Or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled\nthat person, right? Where of course, they were\nfull on a part of the mob, like, you know, kind of at\nthat moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference\nfalsification happening in the other direction. And his prediction, I think,\nbasically is you'll end up with the same quote,\n\"problem\" on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. You know, how far is American\nsociety willing to go on any of these things? I don't know. But like, there is some question there. And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this, you\nknow, elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those\npeople are still in power and they're in very, you\nknow, important positions. And The New York Times is\nstill The New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard. And like, those people haven't\nchanged like at all, right? And bureaucrats in the governments and, you know, senior democratic, you know, politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there, you know, right now feeling like reality\nhas just smacked them hard in the face 'cause they\nlost the election so badly. But they're now going into a, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War, right? And that form of the Civil\nWar is completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize\n'cause we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half\nof them are saying, \"No, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak, we were too soft. You know, we must become\nmore revolutionary. We must double down and we\nmust, you know, celebrate, you know, murders in the street of health insurance executives.\" And that right now is like a real fight. - If I could tell you\na little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a\nhistorian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking\nabout having a podcast, on doing a podcast. And he eventually said that,\n\"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I\njust don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are\nthe particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would\nsurprise a lot of people if I said who it is. You know, this is a\nperson who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80-plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Okay? Nevertheless, he just\ndoesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just\nhave a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk\nto your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are\nfeeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts,\nhow quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you\nmentioned 20, 60, 20 matters and the contents of the\nprivate groups matters, and the dynamics of how\nthat shifts matters. 'Cause it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. There's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these\nnew vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold. - Yeah. So he's a friend of yours, I respect that you don't wanna name him. I also respect you\ndon't wanna beat on him, so I would like to beat\non him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? - Yes. He should use it. - So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate\nindictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart\nof our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it's, by the way, it's\nlike across the board, it's like all the top universities. It's like, 'cause the\nsiren song for right? What it's been for 70 years,\nwhatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure\nsystem, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an\nacademic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what\nyou actually think, right? Then you can do your\nwork and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these\npeople have done to it. Like it's gone, like that entire thing was\nfake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely, completely giving up the\nentire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually\n100% by taxpayer money. - What's the inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this,\nwhat can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? - That the population at large is gonna realize the\ncorruption in their industry and it's going to withdraw the funding? - (laughs) It's okay. So desperation. (laughs)\n- No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next.\nOkay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources\nof federal funding. The big one is a federal\nstudent loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of\ndollars at this point. And then only spiraling, you know, way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know\nthat when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as\nmuch as 70% of the money for central uses. - [Lex] Yeah. - Number three is tax exemption\nat the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit\ninstitutions as opposed to, let's say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close\nto a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources\nof federal taxpayer money, and then for the state\nschools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild, 'cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at University of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed\nand I'm cheering for them, but the problem is, you're now inserting. Suppose you and I wanna\nstart a new university and we wanna hire all the\nfree thinking professors, and we wanna have the\nplace that fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. I'll give you the most direct reason, we can't get access to that money, we can't get access to\nfederal student funding. Do you know how\nuniversities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They're not accredited by\nthe Department of Education. Instead, what happens is, the Department of Education\naccredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that\ndo the accreditation. Guess what the composition of\nthe accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to\nfederal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic\nthey are about accrediting a new university? Right, and so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone... I mean, it's just obvious now. It's just gone like sideways in basically any possible\nway it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting beaten\nup on campus for being, you know, the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every\npossible way at this point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these\nthings without replacing them. And there's no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's\nlike everything in life. I mean, in a sense, this is\nlike the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when\na company does a bad job, is they go bankrupt and another company\ntakes its place, right? And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that\nis what happens is this is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? 'Cause things are tested and tried, and then you, you know, the things that are good survive. And so these places\nhave cut themselves off. They've been allowed to cut\nthemselves off from both, from evolution at the institutional level and evolution of the\nindividual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable\nin their current form. - I disagree with you on that. Maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can\nrevolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford\nand MIT are important. - Oh, but that logic\ndoesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. - Underpants gnome, can you\nexplain what that means? - Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started\nwatching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is \"South Park.\" - Yes.\n- And there is- - Wow. - And there is a, which by the way is a little\naggressive for a nine-year-old. - Very aggressive. - But he likes it. So he's learning all kinds of new words. - And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. - I told him, I said, \"You're\ngonna hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\" - Right. (laughs) Education. - And I said, \"You know\nhow we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I said, \"Not using a word that you learn in here\ndoes not count as lying.\" - [Lex] Wow.\n- \"And keep that in mind.\" - This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. - And of course, in the\nvery opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls\nthe other kid a dildo. Right, we're off to the races. - Yep. Let's go. - \"Daddy, what's a dildo?\" - [Lex] Yep. (both laughing) - So, you know, \"Sorry son, I don't know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So the-\n- Underpants gnome. - So famous episode of \"South\nPark,\" the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat... All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing the underpants. And it's just like, well,\nwho on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it's\nthe underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants\ngnomes that come to town and they've got this\nlittle underground warrant of tunnels in storage places\nfor all the underpants. And so they go out at night,\nthey steal the underpants, and the kids discover that, you\nknow, the underpants gnomes, and they're, you know,\n\"What are you doing? Like what's the point of this?\" And so the underpants gnomes\npresent their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit.\n- Yeah. - [Marc] Step two, question mark. (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So you just proposed the underpants gnome-\n- Yeah. - Which is very common in politics. Oh, so the form of this in politics is we must do something.\n- Yeah. - This is something,\ntherefore we must do this. But there's no causal logic chain in there at all to expect\nthat's actually gonna succeed 'cause there's no reason to believe that it is.\n- Yeah, but- - And it's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the\nhost of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I hear this, I have friends\nwho are on these boards, right?\n- Yeah. - Very involved in these places, and I hear this all the\ntime, which is like, \"Oh, these are very important. We must fix them.\" And so therefore, they're fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. - If there's that pressure\nthat you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty primary, fire a lot of the administration and realign and reinvigorate\nthis idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't... Because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is\naligned with this very idea that you're talking about. It's this meaning like\nintellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface it's aligned, underneath it's become corrupted. - If we say free speech and\nacademic freedom, often enough, sooner or later, these tenured\nprofessors will get brave. - Wait, do you think the universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions\nfor educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit\nthat's outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create\ninstitution like that? - How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? - Right. You invent something new? - You open a new restaurant. - Yeah. - Like how often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that's just absolutely horrible, and it's poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you\ngo back and it's fantastic? Charlie Munger actually\nhad the best comment on, this great investor, Charlie Munger, has great comment. He was once asked, he's like,\nyou know, his, you know, General Electric was going\nthrough all these challenges and he was asked to do Q&A. It said, \"How would you fix the culture at General Electric?\" And he said, \"Fix the\nculture at General Electric?\" He said, \"I couldn't even fix\nthe culture at a restaurant.\" (Lex laughing) Like, it's insane. Like obviously you can't do it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nobody in business\nthinks you can do that. Like, it's impossible. Like it's not, now look, having said all that, I\nshould also express this 'cause I have a lot of friends\nwho work at these places and are involved in various\nattempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong, I\nwould love to be wrong. I would love for the\nunderpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how\nto do. I would love to fix it, I'd love to see them come back\nto their spoken principles, I think that'd be great. I'd love to see the professors\nwith tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I\nmean, it would be fantastic. You know, my partner and I have done like a lot of\npublic speaking on this topic, it's been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay,\nlike these challenges have to be confronted directly. By the way, let me also\nsay something positive. You know, especially post-October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart\npeople who are major donors and board members of these\ninstitutions like Marc Rowan, you know, who are really\ncoming in trying to, you know, I think legitimately\ntrying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He's working overtime to try to do this. Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question\nwould just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? - I'm a person that\nbelieves in leadership. If you have the right leadership- - [Marc] Right. - The whole system can be changed. - So here's a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? - You know how I think runs it? - [Marc] Yeah. - Whoever the fuck says they run it, that's what great leadership is. Like a president has that power.\n- But how does- - President of university has the leverage 'cause they can mouth off like Elon can. - Can they fire the professors? - They can fire them through\nbeing vocal publicly, yes. - Can they fire the professors? - What are you talking about legally? - [Marc] Can they fire- - No, they cannot fire the professors. - Then we know who runs the university. - The professors? - Yeah, professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they're, of course, in a radicalization\nfeedback cycle driving- - You said feral students?\n- The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows\nis that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them\nbecause they cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same\nthing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They cannot outlast you. I mean it's the whole thing\nthat, it's the resistance. Like they can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. - That's definitely a crisis\nthat needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that\nI'm defending academia here. I agree with you that\nthe situation is dire but I just think that\ninstitutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been\ngrilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation\nyou said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's- - I didn't say Dairy Queen\nis a great restaurant. - Let the listener take- - I said Dairy Queen\nis the best restaurant. - The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc\nAndreessen is saying today- - I don't wanna-\n- Put that into cont- - You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard.\n- Yeah. - They can get like\n4,000 calories in a cup. - They can and they're delicious. - [Marc] It's amazing. - They're truly delicious-\n- They're really fantastic. And they'll put anything in there you want.\n- All right- - Okay, so, but anyway, lemme just close by saying, look, my friends at the university\nsystem, I would just say, \"Look like, this is the challenge.\" Like I would just pose\nthis as the challenge. Like to me, like this is, having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation\nthat actually has to happen. This is the bar that\nactually has to be hit. These problems need to\nbe confronted directly, 'cause I think there's been way too much, I mean, I'm actually worried\nkinda on the other side, there's too much happy talk\nin these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers\ncome to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is\ngoing through, you know, no fault of any of ours,\nbut like the fuse is going and there's some window of time here to fix this and address\nit and justify the money 'cause it just, normal taxpayers sitting in\nnormal towns in normal jobs are not gonna tolerate\nthis for that much longer. - You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep\ninto the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to\nspeak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were\nthere when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of\ncensorship on social media. So take me to, through\nthat history, if you can, the use of censorship. - So I was there on the\nground floor in 1993. (both laughing) - There's multiple floors to\nthis building, apparently. - There are.\n- (laughs) Yeah. - So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. - That is fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. Actually, 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. - Did you have the courage to\nspeak up back then? (laughs) - I did not have any problems\nspeaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, you know, I\nwas legitimate, you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research\nproject actually funded by the federal government\nat a public university. So, you know, I don't\nthink my boss was like in any way outta line,\nbut it was like, yeah, like this web browser thing is great, but like could it just make\nsure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for\na second, as a technologist, I had a issue, which is this\nwas like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm (laughs) that I was going to have to design. And then apparently a variety of other, apparently body parts people are also sensitive about.\n- Yeah. - And then I politely declined to do this. - For just the technical\ndifficulties of it. - Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm a, you know,\nI'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days the internet\ngenerally was, you know, a free-fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting\nas sort of pre-'93, the internet was such a\nspecific niche community. Like, it was like the million\nkind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually like\ndidn't really have a lot of, you know, issues that people\nwere like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn't\nwanna start the process. So I think the way to think\nabout this, so first of all, you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I've been involved with\nthis at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007, so I've seen everything\nin the last, you know, almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I've been involved in most of the other companies over time, so I was an angel investor in Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover\nof Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we\nwere the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk\nspecifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you\nlike the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah, so basically the\nway to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that\ncan have zero censorship. And by the way, that also\nmirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited\nfree speech either. The US First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from\nthe Supreme Court over time. You know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're not\ncovered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are gonna\nstart an internet company and have a service, we can't\nhave that stuff either, right? 'Cause it's illegal or\nit will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always gonna\nhave a censorship engine. I mean, hopefully, it's not\nactually in the browser, but like you're gonna have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now\nyou have a machine right now. Now you have a system where\nyou can put in rules saying, we allow this, we don't allow that. You have enforcement, you\nhave consequences, right? And once that system is in place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now\nanybody in that company or anybody associated with that company, or anybody who wants to\npressure that company will just start to say, \"Okay,\nyou should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\" And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like\nvery, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided\nwith the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. You know, it's the kids that\nwere in school between like, you know, for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and like, they came out\nlike super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started\nmounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that\nthese companies were, you know, very subject to being controlled and the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors\nwere almost all Democrats and, you know, there's\ntremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from\nthe first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people\nand other, you know, law enforcement\nintelligence people came in and worked, and you know, they were all Democrats for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they, you know, picked it up and put it\non, and then they just ran. And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech\nconversation started exactly like you'd expect, which is,\nwe can't have the N-word. And which the answer is fair enough, let's not have the N-word. Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right? And Jordan Peterson has\ntalked a lot about this. The definition of hate\nspeech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, right? So we can't have things that make, you know, people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like me that are\ndisagreeable raise their hands and say, \"Well, that idea right there\nmakes me uncomfortable.\" But of course, that doesn't\ncount as hate speech, right? So, you know, the ring\nof power is on one hand and not on the other hand. And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently like\ncompletely anodyne comments that are completely\nlegitimate on television or on the Senate floor all\nof a sudden our hate speech can't be said online. So that, you know, the\nring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the\nstuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little\nbit of that early on, but of course, that really\nkicked in with Trump. So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by like three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence\nof the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you\nknow, a ring of power that was even more powerful, right? Because, you know, hate\nspeech, it's like, okay, at some point, if\nsomething offensive or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with\nmisinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, what do we know for 800 years or whatever Western civilization, it's that, you know,\nthere's only a few entities that can determine the\ntruth on every topic. You know, there's God, you\nknow, there's the king. We don't have those anymore and the rest of us are\nall imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any\ngroup of experts is gonna sit around the table and decide\non the truth is, you know, deeply anti-Western and\ndeeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation\nkind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax\ninto just full-blown, we're gonna use that weapon\nfor whatever we want. And then of course, then the\nculminating moment on that, that really was the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was we're gonna censor all theories that the COVID virus might\nhave been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies\nlike that was the point where people for the first\ntime, this is like what, three years ago for the\nfirst time they were like, and that was when it sunk in\nwhere it's just like, okay, this has spun completely outta control. But anyway, that's how\nwe got to where we are. And then basically that spell lasted that complex existed and\ngot expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and so when I am super\nproud of those guys, 'cause they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were gonna be\na free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And, you know, they\ntried to just beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by\nthe way, from, you know, let's say certain of the\nplatform companies, you know, basically threatening them.\nAnd they stood up to it. And, you know, sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum\nof speech and conversation, you know, anywhere on planet Earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way, it's great. And then obviously Elon, you\nknow, with X was the, you know, the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. - And there's also like singular moments, I think you've spoken about\nthis, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. - [Marc] Yes. - There's certain moments that just kinda shake\neverybody up, the right person, the right time, just it's a wake-up call. - So that there, and\nI will tell you, like, and I should say Jon Stewart\nattacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him, but I would say, I would say\nlong run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of \"The Daily Show\" when he was on it, you know, for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance\non the Colbert Show. And I don't know how\nbroadly this is, you know, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don't know how,\nif people remember this, but I will tell you in the\nrooms where people discuss what his misinformation and these policies, that\nwas a very big moment. That was probably actually\nthe key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I\nwould say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who\ndon't recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, like, you know, you absolutely\nmust lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep\nall the schools closed. You absolutely must have\neverybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a\nmask like the whole thing. And then one of those was,\nyou absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you're a fascist\nNazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person, right? And that was like uniform\nand that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don't know if\nthey planned it or not, 'cause Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much of it was a bit, but he went on there and\nhe just had one of these, like the Emperor's wearing no\nclosed things where he said, \"It's just not plausible that you had the COVID\nsuper virus appear 300 yards down the street from the\nWuhan Institute (laughs) of lethal coronaviruses.\" Like, it's just not plausible that certainly that you\ncould just rule that out. And then there was another\nkey moment, actually, the more serious version\nwas I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big\npiece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is like\none of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been like\nalt, you know, renegade, there had been, you know, people\nrunning around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was\nlike in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember let's say a board meeting at one of these companies after that, where basically, you know, everybody looked around\nthe table and was like, \"All right, like, I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore.\" And, you know, and then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \"Well, wait a minute, why were we censoring\nthat in the first place?\" And okay, like, and then, you know, the\ndownstream, not that day, but the downstream\nconversations were like, \"Okay, if we made such\na giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective\nmistake censoring that, then what does that say about\nthe rest of our regime?\" And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. - I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made\nwas a courageous act. - [Marc] Yeah, I agree. - I think we need to have\nmore of that in the world. And like you said, Elon,\neverything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg\ndid on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? - He has become, I think, an outstanding\ncommunicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for\na lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he's, you know,\nhe's one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And you know, as you do\nwith all of your episodes, like when somebody sit\nand talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody 'cause it's really hard to\nbe artificial for that long. And, you know, he's now\ndone that repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then, look, again, I would maybe put him in\nthe third category now with, certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put\nhim up there now with, you know, kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that. Like he said on that show\nwhat he really believes, he said all the same things\nthat he says in private. Like, I don't think there's\nreally any discrepancy anymore. I would say he has\nalways taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running\na company the size of Meta and to running services\nthat are that large. And I think, you know, his\nconception of what he's doing, which I think is correct,\nis he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. And then, you know, the\ncompany has, you know, many tens of thousands of\nemployees and many investors, and it's a public company,\nand he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so, you know, he has\nnot felt like he has had, let's just say, the complete\nflexibility that Elon has had. And, you know, people could\nargue that one way or the other, but, you know, he talked about a lot. He's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm gonna put\nmyself right back up there. Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this.\nLike, I've also learned a lot. Like, my views on things\nare very different than they were 10 years\nago on lots of topics. And so, you know, I've\nbeen on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as, or better\nthan anybody else I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show\nabout something very important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a set of decisions\nthat you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and\nso forth and it's valid, but you are under tremendous\nexternal pressure as well. And by the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've got your executives\nin some cases coming at you. You've got your board in\nsome cases coming at you. You've got your\nshareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire\nnonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you and, you know, that's\nthe really, you know, stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation\nof the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, then again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they\nclearly didn't wanna do and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I say, like I've known every CEO of Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the\njob, it was just daily beatings. Like it just getting punched in the face every single day, constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting (laughs) physically\npunched in the face, and then-\n- Getting better and better. Yeah. - You know, and he's very good\nat, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people\nto have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate\nwith like, I would say, extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in\nhis job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a\nlot about him that he has, you know, risen to this\noccasion the way that he has. And by the way, I should\nalso say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, you know, legitimate\nthing for people to say, but you know, it's like, \"Oh, you're only doing\nthis because of Trump, or, you know, whatever.\" And it's just like, no, like\nhe has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them\nout for a very long time. And so I think what\nyou saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the moment thing that could change at any time. - So what do you think it's like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal\npressure and external pressure? What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? - That's a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like, it's not a thing, right? And again, legitimately so, like CEOs get paid a lot,\nlike the whole thing. There's a lot of great things about it. So it's not like they\nshould be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that\nthey are human beings. And it is the case that\nit is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job is because your words\ncarry tremendous weight and you are dealing with\nextremely complicated issues, and you're under a tremendous\namount of emotional, you know, personal, emotional stress. And, you know, you often end\nup not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like, keep up an exercise routine\nand all those things. And you know, you come under family stress 'cause you're working all the time. Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO of our last company before\nwe started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life\nwas even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was like supposed\nto be like having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you get that a lot. But the key thing is like, you\ncan't talk to people, right? So I mean, you could talk to\nyour spouse and your kids, but like, they don't understand that they're networking in your company. They don't understand, have\nthe context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And they can't resist. Like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily\nrely on what they say. It's very hard in most\ncompanies to talk to your board because they can fire you. Now, Mark has the situation\n'cause he has control, it actually turns out he\ncan talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about\nmany things that he does that most CEOs won't talk\nto their boards about because we literally,\nbecause we can't fire him. But a general, including\nall the CEOs of Twitter, that none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the board members, they're gonna fire you, you\ncan't talk to the shareholders 'cause they'll just like\ndump your stock, right? Like, okay, so every once in a while, what you find is basically the\nbest-case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a\nlittle bit outta that. But even that's fraught with peril 'cause can you really talk\nabout confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it's just a very\nlonely isolating thing to start with. And then on top of that,\nyou apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal, external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand\nmost forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. - Hmm.\n- Right. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external\npressure you can withstand, and by that I mean\ninvestors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative article,\nyou know, negative headline and you know, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many\nof those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot withstand\nis the internal crack. And what I always look for in high-pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the\ninternal team cracks. Because I know the minute that happens, we're in a different regime. (laughs) Like, it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid. Like we're in a different regime and like the whole thing\ncan unravel in the next week 'cause then people turn, I mean this, I guess this is what's happening\nin Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire\nchief turned on each other, and that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get\nput back together again. It is over, it is not\ngoing to work ever again. And that's what happens\nto inside companies. And so somebody like Mark is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's been very good at\nmaintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,\na lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing\nI'd say, as I said, that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And especially, although not\nall one is government pressure. Is that when your\ngovernment comes for you? Like yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out\nof them in short order. - Can you just linger on that 'cause it is maybe educating\nand deeply disturbing? You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again\nthis government pressure. So you think they've crossed a line into essentially criminal\nlevels of pressure? - Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs) but yes, absolute criminality. - Can you explain how\nthose possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? - So I just start with\nis a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good 'cause it needs\nto be in the public record. And so there's three forms of things that are in the public record\nthat people can look at. So when is the Twitter Files,\nright, which Elon put out with the set of journalists\nwhen he took over. And I will just tell\nyou, the Twitter Files are 100% representative of what I've seen at every\nother one of these companies. And so you can just see\nwhat happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies,\nyou know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind\nof pressure that they got. So that's number one. That's stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven't. The second is Mark referenced\nthis in the Rogan podcast. There's a congressman Jim Jordan, who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, you\nknow, whatever three years have done a full-scale\ninvestigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have\nnow been made public and you can download those reports. And there's like 2,000 pages\nworth of material on that. And that's essentially\nthe Facebook version of the Twitter Files just arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself\ntalking about this on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just\ndefer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is\nbasically the government, you know, over time and then\nculminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years, just decided that the First\nAmendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that\nfederal laws around free speech and around conspiracies\nto take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure. They just like literally\narbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, you know, threaten repercussions and force them to censor. And you know, there's\nthis whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment\nonly applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't\napply to companies. It's like, well, there's actually a little\nbit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely\napplies to the government. Like 100%, the First Amendment\napplies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship\nregime that was put in place. There was no due process\nput in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just\nlike flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. And then there are\nspecific federal statutes, it's 18 241 and 18 242. And one of them applies to federal employees,\ngovernment employees, and the other one\napplies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United\nStates Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional\nrights are enumerated, for example, in the First\nAmendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes\naway rights that you have, they don't need to be\nspecifically enumerated rights in the Constitution order\nto still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have\nthe rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right, and so de-banking\nqualifies as a right, you know, right to access to the financial system,\nis every bit something that's subject to these\nlaws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, which is we've talked\nabout two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we've talked about the companies. The government employees\nfor sure have misbehaved. The companies, there's a very\ninteresting question there as to whether they are victims\nor perpetrators or both. You know, they will defend\nand they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims,\nnot perpetrators, right? They're the downstream\nsubjects of pressure, you know, not the cause of pressure, but there's a big swath of\npeople who are in the middle and specifically the ones that\nare funded by the government that I think are in\npossibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of these\nthird-party censorship bureaus. I mean the one that is\nsort of is most obvious is the so-called Stanford\nInternet Observatory that got booted up there\nover the last several years. And they basically were funded\nby the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in\nthis very interesting spot where there could be, you know, very obvious theory under\nwhich they're basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they're\nalso very exposed on this and have behaved in just\nflagrantly illegal ways. - So fundamentally, government should not\ndo any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? - Can't. Not allowed. - It really is disturbing. I mean it probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the the old will to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection 'cause you can't put a check\non power for government, right? - There are so many ways\nthat they can get you, like there are so many ways\nthey can come at you and get you and, you know, the thing\nhere to think about is a lot of times when people\nthink about government action, they think about legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It's like this, you know, fancy little bill sneaked\nalong and goes this- - I'm just the bill. Yeah.\n- Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. Like that doesn't actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly\nwhat we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about\ngovernment power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the\nequivalent of legislation, but having not gone through\nthe legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that\nthe DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They're regulated and there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche\nyou'll hear a lot, which is, \"Oh, private companies can\ndo whatever they want.\" It's like, \"Oh, no, they can't.\" They're subject to tens of\nthousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes\ndown when you don't comply with regulations is profound. Like they can completely\nwreck your company with no ability for you\nto do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole\nprogram a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency\nfor payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were gonna\nbuild into every product, and they were gonna be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government\nand they went to the, all these different try to\nfigure out how to make it, so it's like fully compliant\nwith anti-money laundering and all these, you know,\ncontrols and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters\nto the big banks saying, \"We're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every\naspect of your business is going to come under\ngreatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\" which is, of course, the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner\nrestaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov\ncocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? And like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a law, it's\nnot even a regulation, it's just like straight\ndirect state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they're just like flat\nout telling you what to do, which is, of course,\nwhat a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. And so anyway, so what\nthese companies experienced was they experienced the\nfull panoply of this, but the level of intensity\nwas in that order, it was actually, legislation\nwas the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important and then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were\nultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people\nwho don't do it, right? So like as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, you have to decide. You don't wanna live in\nthat regime. I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people\non the right got very angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. You know, maybe some people on the left will now not want their, you know, Democratic nominees to\nbe so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written\nin the FT just now saying, we just need like broad\nafter what we've been through in the last decade, we need to broad base\ntruth and reconciliation, you know, efforts to really\nget to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like ultimately, we need\npeople to go to jail 'cause we need to set\nobject lessons that say that you don't get to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to\nthe new administration, and I don't wanna speak for them and I don't wanna predict\nwhat they're gonna do, but they for sure have\nthe ability to do both of those things and you know,\nwe'll see where they take it. - Yeah, it's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants\nthis kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people\nthat are participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's\nthat kind of protection. Nobody wants that. - So I use the metaphor, the ring of power.\n- Yeah. - And for people who\ndon't catch the reference, that's \"Lord of the Rings.\" And the thing with the Ring of Power and \"Lord of the Rings,\"\nit's the ring the Gollum has in the beginning and\nit turns you invisible. And it turns out it like unlocks all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically, the moral\nlesson of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which was, you know, written by a guy who thought very deeply\nabout these things is, yeah, the ring of power is\ninherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they're like, \"Gandalf, just put on the\nring and like fix this.\" Right, and he will not put the ring on even to like end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. And then, you know, as it starts, the character of Gollum is\nthe result of, you know, like a normal character\nwho ultimately becomes, you know, this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. And so, I mean, I think you said something\nactually quite profound there, which is the ring of power\nis infinitely tempting. You know, the censorship\nmachine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, like\nyou are going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting\n'cause it's so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people\nfeel any of this today. They should. I don't know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years\nlater, you know, you would hope that you would realize that\nyour soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being, you know, extremely authoritarian\nand anti-democratic and anti-Western. - Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the\nmost powerful human on Earth. - I'm not sure about that. - You don't think he is? - Well, he doesn't have the nukes so. - Nukes. (Marc laughing) Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? - Yeah. - How can he and/or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting\naspects of this power? - I mean, I think the\ndanger is there with power. It's flat out there. I would say with Elon, we'll see. I would say with Elon, and\nI would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would\nsay so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost\nevery front for like, you know, the last 30 years. (Lex laughing) But including all this stuff recently, like I think he's been a\nreal hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say,\nI guess the sort of case that he has this level of\npower is that some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are, you know, are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is, I do think a lot of how\nElon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's the companies\nhe's running directly where I think he's doing very well, and we're investors in multiple\nof them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements, and then it's the downstream\neffects of his statements. So like for example, it's, you know, for the last couple weeks,\nit's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this\nrape gang scandal, you know, this rape organized child\nrape thing in the UK. And you know, it's a preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren't willing to talk about it, it kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden\nthere's now in the UK this like massive explosion\nof basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's\nkind of woken up and being like, \"Oh, my God,\nyou know, this is really bad.\" And there will be now, you know, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know,\nhe played the role of the boy who said, the emperor\nhas no clothes, right? But here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about\nsomething that was true, right? And so had he said it about\nsomething that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody\nover there instantly, they were like, \"Oh, yeah,\nhe's right,\" right? (laughs) Like nobody seriously\nsaid they're just arguing the details now. So number one, it's like,\nokay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far... Put it this way. Like, how worried are we about\nsomebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say,\nespecially in the last decade of what we've been through where everybody's been lying\nall the time about everything, I'd say, I think we\nshould run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the\nmoney and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like it,\nthere's a clear-cut case that the more money in\npolitics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic\nof public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary\noutspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost. You'll notice that money and\npolitics has all most vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Trump spent far, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don't know, something like 3 billion total in Trump, I think spent again like a\nthird or a fourth of that. And so the money in politics kind of topic has kind of vanished from\na popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit\nnow that Elon is spending. You know, but again, it's like, okay, he's spending,\nbut the data would seem to indicate in the last, at\nleast in the last eight years, that money doesn't win\nthe political battles. It's actually like the\nvoters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there I\nwould say like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and use in a definitive way. - And I don't know if\nthose parallels there, but I could also say\njust on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that's not always the case. So that's a good thing there.\n- Yeah. - If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. (laughs) Who gets to put on the ring? - [Marc] Frodo. - Frodo, yeah.\n- Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of\n\"Lord of the Rings\" right, is even Frodo would've been, you know, even Frodo would've been corrupted, right? But, you know, nevertheless,\nyou had somebody who could do what it took at at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because it's sort of our\npost-Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort of this post-secularized\nChristian context in the West now, and it's, you know, we\nconsider Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe\nessentially all the same things. We just dress them up\nin sort of fake science. (Lex laughing) So the one thing that we're all told, we're all taught from early is that the best people in\nthe world are the people who care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know,\nall of our figures are people who care about all of, you know... Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared\nabout all of humanity. Like it's this universe, the person who cares the\nmost about everybody. And with Elon, you have a\nguy who literally, like, is, he talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly\nthe same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us through\nmulti-planetary civilization, so that we can survive a\nstrike on any one planet, so that we can extend the\nlight of human consciousness into the world and, you\nknow, into the universe and have it persist, you know, in the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. (both laughing) - Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. - Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear. - You said that we\nalways end up being ruled by the elite of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? - So this comes from a\nItalian political philosopher from about 100 years ago named Robert... I'm gonna mangle it from, let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. And then I learned about\nit through a famous book on politics, probably the\nbest book on politics written in the 20th century called \"The Machiavellians\"\nby this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in \"The Machiavellians,\" he resurrects what he calls is this sort of Italian realist school of political philosophy from the '10s and '20s. And\nthese were people, to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who\nwere trying to understand the actual mechanics of how\npolitics actually works. So to get to the actual sort\nof mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, Michels\nhad this concept ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law of oligarchy, and I mean take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy 'cause it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there's basically three\nforms of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of many. There's oligarchy, which\nis rule of the few. And there's monarchy,\nwhich is rule of the one. And you can just use that\nas a general framework of any government you're gonna be under is gonna be one of those,\njust mechanical observation without even saying\nwhich one's good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that\nMichels asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like is there actually\nsuch a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually\nlike direct government? And what he did was he mounted this sort of\nincredible historical exploration of whether democracies had\never existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most\ndemocratic private organization in the world that he\ncould find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist\nGerman autoworkers union that was like wholly\ndevoted to the workers of the world uniting, you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization\nout of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and\nhe is like, \"Oh, nope.\" There's a leadership class. You know, there's like six guys at the top and they control everything (laughs) and then they lead the rest\nof the membership along, you know, by the nose, which is, of course, the\nstory of every union. The story of every union is\nalways the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers' union, right? Like, you know, there's\na guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number\ntwo is his son, right? Like, that's not like a, you\nknow, an accident, right? So the iron law oligarchy\nbasically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling\nelite structurally. And he said, \"The reason for that is because the masses\ncan't organize,\" right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is\n25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize,\nthe majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in\npolitics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a\nsmall organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence... I forget the name of it. It was called like The Workers' Revolt or something like that. There was like a two-year period where they basically experimented\nwith direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition\nsystem, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. You know, anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes\nit's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe, and it's caused enormous\ndamage to the state. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And so of course, they didn't\ngive us a direct democracy, they gave us a representative\ndemocracy, right? And so they built the\noligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch\nand the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson\nof \"The Machiavellians\" is you can deny that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think\nabout how to make a system work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that\nis actually what's happening. - And lucky for us, the founders saw this\nand figured out a way to, given that there's going\nto be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite-\n- Yes. - So it doesn't get out of hand. - And it was very clever. Right? And you know, some of this was\nbased on earlier experiments. By the way, you know, these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of like Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance\nhistory, you know, \"The Federalist Papers,\" they\nargue this a great length. You can read it all. You know, they ran like a\none of the best seminars in world history trying\nto figure this out. And they went through all this and yeah. And so they thought\nthrough it very carefully, but just, I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did it just through the three\nbranches of government, right? Executive, legislative and judicial, sort of balance of powers. But the other way, they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done earlier. I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, right? And so the, you know,\nthe House and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population,\nand the Senate is not, right? The small states have\njust as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get\nreelected every two years to make it very responsive\nto the will of the people. And they made the decision\nto have the Senate get reelected every six years\nso that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose\none or the other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does\nit live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And you know, there's lots of open\nquestions there, but you know, this system has survived\nfor coming on 250 years with a country that has been\nspectacularly successful. But I don't think, at least,\nyou know, I don't think any of us would trade the\nsystem for any other one. And so it's, yeah, one of the\ngreat all-time achievements. - Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were\nall pretty young relative to our current set of leaders.\n- They were. Many in their 20s at the\ntime, and like super geniuses. This is one of those things\nwhere it's just like, all right, something happened where there\nwas a group of people where, you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einsteins of politics. Yeah. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical\npractice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused\non what would actually work, which is, you know, I\nthink the way to think about these things. - There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. - They were shape rotators,\nnot word cells. (laughs) - I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were center to them, you're center to a lot of memes. - [Marc] I was. - You're the meme dealer\nand the meme popularizer. - That's true. That meme I get some credit for and then the current thing is, the other one I get some credit for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. - Take credit and run with it. - [Marc] Yep. - If we can just linger\non the Machiavellians. It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned looking\nat the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've\nseen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting\nthings you can sort of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? - Yeah, so a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this\na bit with the universities, which is you can apply a\nMachiavellian-style lens to the... It's why I posed the\nquestion to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the\nuniversity, the trustees, the administration, the\nstudents or the faculty? And you know, the true\nanswer is some combination of the three or of the\nfour, plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera, right? And so you know, there's a mechanical\ninterpretation of that. I mean, companies operate\nunder the exact same, you know, set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like the CEO runs the\ncompany basically up to the day that either the shareholders\nor the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt,\nit's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it's very hard for the\nCEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if The New\nYork Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand\nis who can get who fired? You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper\ncolumnist who makes, you know, $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes, you\nknow, $200 million a year. And it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before\nI have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. - Did anyone ever get fired\nfrom the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? (laughs) So Bill like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. - No, 'cause what happens\nis they wear it with a... And yeah, I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, right? Which is, you know, if\nthey're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably\npriding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to legitimate criticism and, you know, they're\nobviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight\nto the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. You know, and I happen to know the CEO, and I think he's quite a good CEO, but I like, well, this is a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer\nrun his own company, right? Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating\nplaying out right now. Not to dwell on these fires, but you see the pressure\nreveals things, right? And so if you've been\nwatching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, like whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical\nsocial revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It's endorses every crazy\nleft-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of\nall the people who, you know, are currently burning\nthe city to the ground. It's just like endorsed\nevery single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, for the first time, I think put his foot down right\nbefore the November election and said, we're getting... He said, \"We're gonna get outta this thing where we just always\nendorse the Democrat.\" And we said, we're not\nendorsing, I think he said, \"We're not endorsing for the presidency.\" And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like our billionaire backer who's... And I don't know what he spends, but like, he must be burning 50 or 100\nmillion dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. He paid 500 million for\nit, which is amazing. Back when people still thought\nthese things were businesses. And then he's probably\nburned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another\n50, 100 million a year to do this. And the journalists at\nthe LA Times hate him with the fury of 1,000 suns. Like they just like absolutely\nfreaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones that\ncan get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, you know,\nmost horrible things about him. And they wanna constantly run\nthese stories attacking him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in\nLA are having right now to this fire, and to this just like\nincredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head\nendorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour,\nhe's basically just, he's decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his\nown newspaper. (laughs) Very smart guy. He is not a press tour and\nhe is basically saying, yeah, yes, we did all that and we\nendorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and\nwe're gonna completely change. And his paper is, you know,\nin a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn't been him. (laughs) It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, the\nowner is showing up saying, \"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge.\" And the reporters are\nsaying, \"No, you're not.\" And like it is freaking on. And so again, if the, the\nMachiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power\nactually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and super powerful who even\nowns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full-scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist? - And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there. - And firing people.\n- Firing people. Yeah. - You know, he has removed\npeople and he has set new rules. I mean, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying he's now at long last actually\nexercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other\nowners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know, so\nhe's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really\ninteresting open question. Like, you know, in a fight\nbetween the employees and the employer, like\nit's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. - And just to stay on\njournalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just wanna say put him in\nthe category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever\nseen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. - What do you think is like\nthe most impressive example? - Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to, like, I mean, it's like kicking\nthe beehive or whatever, you know, what's gonna follow and do that. I mean that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia\nand then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer\njust tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. And just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people\nlike that out in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be\ncourageous themselves. - Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? - I knew of Neri, his wife, who's a brilliant\nresearcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she's amazing. - Well, the reason I ask\nif you knew about Bill is because a lot of people\nhad not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before some of the\ncampaigns he's been running since in public, and with\nHarvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he was so-called activist\ninvestor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected\nfor probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out, they weren't for the most part battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national\nstories, but in the business and investing world, the\nactivist investor is a very, it's like in the movie \"Taken.\" It's a very specific set of skills. (both laughing) - Yeah. - On how to like really take control of situations.\n- Yeah. - And how to wreck the people\nwho you're going up against. And there's been\ncontroversy over the years on this topic, and there's\ntoo much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid is,\nyou know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly\nmanaged or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that\nmeans the existing management is become entrenched and\nlazy, mediocre, you know, whatever. Not, you're responding to the\nneeds of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically\ngo in with a minority position and then they rally support\namong other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show\nup and they force change. But they are the\naggressive version of this. And I've been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these-\n- Oh-oh. - Where it is amazing\nhow much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don't have formal control. So it would be another chess\npiece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens\nis the effective analysts, a large amount of time, they end up taking over\ncontrol of companies even though they never own more than like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it\nturns out with Bill's, it's such a fascinating case. 'Cause he has that like complete skillset. - (laughs) Yeah. - And he has now decided\nto bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of\nthese places, you know, and some of these battles\nare still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of\npeople who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now\nwith infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that\nkind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook, like in real time. And so Liam Neeson skillset is\ngetting more broadly diffused just by being able to\nwatch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody\nwho's really affecting how all this is playing out. - But even skillset\naside just courage and- - Yes, including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, 'cause like he hasn't been, I'll give you an example. Like my firm venture\ncapital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I\nfeel like I can't do or say 'cause I feel like I would\nbe bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where\nhe worries about that. And so a couple things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship\nwith his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors...\nI know this for a fact. His investors have been\nremarkably supportive of him doing that. 'Cause as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. And so it is the same thing he does in the his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip\nof the spear on something that actually a lot\nmore people agree with. - Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. - And just again, our, you know, how I started is a lot of\npeople are just fed up. - You've been spending a\nbunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new\nadministration in many ways, including interviewing\npeople who might join. So what's your general\nsense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new administration? - So I should start by saying I'm not a member of\nthe new administration. I'm not like in the room\nwhen a lot of these people are being selected. - I believe you said unpaid intern. - I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and I,\nyou know, when helpful, but I'm not making the decisions,\nnor am I in a position to, you know, speak for the administration. So I don't wanna say anything that would cause people\nto think I'm doing that. It's a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is outta office, and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll recall,\nthere was a fair amount of controversy over the\nend of the first term. - Oh, yeah. - The specific concern was, you know, the first Trump administration, you know, they will all say this is like, they didn't come in with a team, right? So you know, they didn't\ncome in with a team and most of the sort of institutional base of the Republican Party\nwere Bush Republicans. And many of them had\nbecome never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time\nputting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time\ngetting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them 2 to 3\nyears to kind of even get the government in place. And then they basically only\nhad the government in place, you know, for basically like\n18 months, and then COVID hit. You know, and then sort of\nthe aftermath and everything, and all the drama and\nheadlines and everything. And so the concern, you know, including from some various smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he gonna be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? 'Cause maybe people got burned out. Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing\nto go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people\nin the first term came under, like, you know, with their\nown withering legal assaults, and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a\nlot of stuff happened, lots of investigations,\nlots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots\nof debanking, by the way. A lot of the officials in the\nfirst Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. - Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. - In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and\nchildren with our ring of power. And so there's like\nthis legitimate question as to like, whether, okay, what will the team for\nthe second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing\nwith the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks\nbetter than the first term and not 'cause the\npeople in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like, influx of like incredibly\ncapable people that have shown up that wanna be part of this, and you just didn't have\nthat the first time. And so they're just\ndrawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than\nthey had the first time. And they're drawing on people\nwho know what the game is. Like they're drawing\non people now who know what is gonna happen and\nthey're still willing to do it. And so they're gonna\nget, I think, you know, some of the best people\nfrom the first term, but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get\nthe first time around. And then second is\nthere's a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they're just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned\nhow everything works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view and now they're 10 years older and they're ready to\ngo serving government. And so there's a\ngenerational shift happening. And actually one of the\ninteresting things about the team that's forming up is\nit's remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members,\nand then many of the second and third level people are\nlike in their 30s and 40s, you know, which is a big change\nfrom the gerontocracy that, you know, we've been under\nfor the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has\nbeen outstanding, you know, and we could sit here and\nlist tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people\nwho are running, you know, it's everything from the people who are running all the\ndifferent departments at HHS. It's the people running, you know, the number two at the\nPentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got, actually two of\nmy partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah, like many, many\nparts of the government, the people are like, really impressive. - Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the\nhuman being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's kind of circles\nof sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically\nsuck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good\nposition to speak to the degree that's happening versus\nhiring based on merit and just getting great teams. - Yeah, so look, I just\nstart by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are, you know, very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. Like he definitely seems\nvery aware of that. So that's one thing. I would just say that the, I\nthink the way to look at that, I mean, and look, like I said, I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say that it's again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished\npeople in the business world and in the medical field. I just, you know, Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH, so I was actually, I was\npart of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. - Nice. Jay's amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. - So I literally got, this is a story. I got to the transition\noffice for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the\ninterview interviewing teams, and they gave us, I didn't\nknow who the candidates were, and they gave us the\nsheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I\nsaw Jay's name, and I, like, I almost physically fell outta my chair. - Yeah. - And I was just like... (laughs) You know, and\nI happen to know Jay, I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like, talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure- - Yeah.\n- Over the last five years. - And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and\nthoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly- - Very serious, very\nanalytical, very applied. And yes, 100%. Tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look\nback at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you\nknow, none of us are perfect, but like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And, you know, we would all\nbe much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just like an\nincredibly capable guy. And look, and then he\nlearned from all that, right? He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody\nlike that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly. It's just a gigantic upgrade. You know, and then Marty\nMakary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a\nCDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been\nspending time with Dr. Oz, so, you know, and I'm not, like, again, I'm not on these teams. I'm not in the room. But like, I've been\nspending enough time trying to help that, like his level of insight into the healthcare system,\nit's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy\nwho's been like in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this\nstuff and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for,\nyou know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, he's like a walking\nencyclopedia on these things. And you know, very dynamic, you know, very charismatic, very\nsmart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have\nsomebody like that in there. And so anyway, they're\njust, I have like 30 of these stories now across\nall these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast\nto the last four years. And it, not even, these people\nare not in the same ballpark. They're just like wildly better. And so it, you know, the pound for pound is\nmaybe be the best team in the White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team\nlike this or something. But there's a lot of really\ngood people in there now. - Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to DOGE? What's the most wildly successful\nnext two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also, can you think\nabout the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges\nwould it be facing? - Yeah, so start by\nsaying, again, I'm not... Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer, I'm not on DOGE, (laughs)\nI'm not a member of DOGE. - We should say there's\nabout 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring. No, I'm just kidding. - Both the angels and\nthe devils on my shoulder are-\n- Okay. All right, cool. - So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE. I'm not in charge of DOGE.\n- Yeah. - Those guys are doing\nit, I'm not doing it. But you know, again,\nI'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, I mean, the basic outlines\nare in public, right? Which it's a time limited, you\nknow, basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the\nexecutive branch, right? And so the implementation\nwill happen through the White House. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is the three kind of streams,\nyou know, kind of target sets, and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. And so, you know, the headline\nnumber, they, you know, put us the $2 trillion number and there's already, you know, disputes over that and whatever, and there's whole question there. But then there's the people thing. And the people thing is\ninteresting 'cause you get into these very kind of\nfascinating questions. And I've been doing this,\nI won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this\nfor people in government as a pop quiz, and I can stump\nthem every time, which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere\nbetween 450 and 520. And nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for\nthe federal government? And the answer is, you know,\nsomething on the order, I forget, but like 4\nmillion full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large\npeople component to this. And then by the way, there's\na related component to that, which is how many of them\nare actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings\nare still empty, right? And then there's questions\nof like, are people, you know, working from home? Or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension, and of course, the money and\nthe people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing, right? And I described earlier\nhow basically our system of government is much more\nnow based on regulations than legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that\nwent through Congress. They're from an agency that,\nthat created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is, Elon have already described, we wanna do the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the\ngovernment off people's backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. But there's also something\nelse that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set\nof Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that\nwent directly after the idea that the executive branch can\ncreate regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding\ncongressional legislation. And most of the federal\ngovernment that exists today, including most of the departments\nand most of the rules, and most of the money,\nand most of the people, most of it is not enforcing\nlaws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \"Large parts, you know, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress,\nthe way that the cartoon said that it should, that may\nnot actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to, they\ndid nothing based on this. They didn't, you know,\npull anything back in. But the new regime, if they\nchoose to, could say, \"Look, the thing that we're doing here is not, you know, challenging the laws, we're actually complying with\nthe Supreme Court decision that basically says we have\nto unwind a lot of this, and we have to unwind the regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional, we have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people.\" And that's how you get from, basically you connect the\nthread from the regulation part back to the money part,\nback to the people part. They have work going on\nall three of these threads. They have, I would say,\nincredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super\ncynical on this topic. And they're like, \"This is impossible. This could never possibly work.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I can't tell you what the secret plans are,\nbut like blow my mind.\" And all three of those,\nlike, they have ideas that are like really quite\namazing as you'd expect from, you know, from the people involved. And so over the course of the\nnext few months, you know, that'll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is, this is going to be very\ndifferent than attempts, like there have been other\nprograms like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one, and then there were others\nbefore that, Reagan had one. The difference is this\ntime, their social media. And so there has never been like, it's interesting, one of the\nreasons people in Washington are so cynical is because\nthey know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad\nspending and all the bad rules and all the, like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion\ndollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that's compounding, and\nit's now passing the size of the defense department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon it's gonna\nbe adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be\nadding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point we enter a\nhyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or\nBrazil and (indistinct), right? And so, like everybody in\nDC knows that something has to be done, and then\neverybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible\nto do anything, right? They know all the problems and they also know the sheer\nimpossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're\nnot taking into account, that what the critics are not taking into account\nis these guys can do this in the full light of day and\nthey can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism, they can expose any element\nof, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government spending. They can run victory\nlapse every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the\npeople into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our\nMachiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy,\noligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of\nthe few, rule of the one. You could think about what's\nhappening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president, rule\nof the one with some power. And then we have the\npeople who can't organize, but they can be informed\nand they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich\nhappening right now, is a way to think about it, which is you've got basically (indistinct) if you got rule of one combining with the rule of many, right? And rule of many is they\ndo get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically. And then essentially\nCongress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic\nclass in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, I think have the power to\ndo all kinds of things here, and I think that would be\nthe way I would wash it. - The transparency. I mean, Elon, just by\nwho he is incentivized to be transparent and show\nthe bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's gonna be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just\nmakes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. - These people are spending our money. - [Lex] Yeah. - These people have enormous\ncontempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here's the thing\nyou hear in Washington, here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear\nis, \"This is impossible, they'll be able to do nothing.\" And then, yeah, I walk them\nthrough this and they're like, it starts to dawn on them that\nthis is a new kind of thing. And then they're like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in\nentitlements and the debt and the military.\" And so like, yeah, you've\ngot like this silly, fake whatever, you know,\nNPR funding or whatever, and like, it's a rounding\nerror and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever,\n$500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging\nstations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they bill eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And costs you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn't matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer\nis like, \"What the fuck?\" (Lex laughing) - What do you mean?\n- It's $30 billion. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then the experts are like, and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's surrounding error.\" No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this\ncavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you're\nabout the 3 trillion. - Yeah.\n- Okay. Then there's the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the\nfederal budget and percentage? No, it's not. But $30 billion divided\nby 30, do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like, what's that math expert? - $100. - $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic\nrelationship with your wife. There's like 100 things\nthat that person can do with $100 that they're not doing 'cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where\nthe money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that $30\nbillion program is not something that is like a very\nimportant thing to go after, is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer-\n- Yeah. - Is just off the charts. And then that's just\none of those programs, there's like 100 of those programs and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of\nthis stuff is running well, like the one thing we know is that none of this\nstuff is running well. Like we know that for sure, right? And we know these people\naren't showing up to work and like we know that all this crazy stuff is happening, right? And like, you know, do you remember Elon's\nstory of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. Okay so Pennsylvania is\nlike a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness, and death, right? And the federal government\nhas just like, let it happen, these incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing\nlaw enforcement thing that they needed to do in\nPennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling\nraw milk with armed raids. - [Lex] Right. - And it turns out it\nreally pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places\n'cause they don't have cars. But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the\nreasons why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law\nenforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, like the system's not working. And so you add up, just\npick $130 billion programs. All right, now you're okay. Math major, 100 times 100. - 10,000. - $10,000. Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. - But it's also not just about money. That's really, obviously money\nis a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude- - [Marc] Yes. - That then in sort of, in\nthe ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody\nwants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that corruption\ncan, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy 'cause you don't wanna be transparent about having done nothing all\nyear, all this kind of stuff. And you now wanna reverse that, so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government,\nbecause the amazing thing if you're to steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can\ndirectly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting. As long as there's no\nbureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. - Yeah. So here's the trick, this blew my mind 'cause I was, you know, once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in\ngovernment called impoundment. And so if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning\nis a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires\nCongress to authorize money to be spent by the\nexecutive branch, right? So the executive branch\ngoes to Congress says, \"We need money X.\" Congress does their thing. They come back and they\nsay, \"You can have money Y.\" The money's appropriated from Congress, the executive branch\nspends it on the military or whatever they spend it\non, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations\nto nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an\nadditional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which\nis the executive branch not only needs Congress to\nappropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is\nnot allowed to underspend. - Yeah, I'm aware of\nthis. I'm aware of this. - And so there's this thing\nthat happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal\nyear, which is September 30th, and it's the great budget flush. And any remaining money\nthat's in the system that they don't know how\nto productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively. - Yep. - To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn't wanna spend the\nmoney can't not spend it. - Yeah. - Like, okay, A, that's not\nwhat's in the constitution. And there's actually quite\na good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that's played\nout in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I\nthink an open mind, you're like, \"All right, this is not\nwhat the founders meant.\" And then number two, again,\nwe go back to this thing of contempt, like, can\nyou imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you're\ndoing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've\nsold your soul, right? Like it's just like, I actually\nthink you sort of had it in a really good point,\nwhich is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. - Yeah.\n- Right. 'Cause it makes them bad people. And they didn't start out\nwanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this like- - Yeah, everywhere.\n- Everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged\nwhat I've seen so far. - It seems like a lot of people\nwill try to slow 'em down, but yeah-\n- For sure. - I hope they get far.\n- Yeah. - Another difficult topic, immigration. - [Marc] Yeah. - What's your take on the, let's say, heated H-1B visa debate\nthat's going on online and legal immigration in general? - Yeah, I should so start by saying, I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I'm not planning to be,\nthis is not an issue that I'm working on or\nthat I'm going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing.\nSo my firm is doing, so like, I'm not in this in the new\nadministration or the government. I'm not planning to be, so\npurely just personal opinion. So I would say I would\ndescribe as a complex or nuanced, hopefully\nnuanced view on this issue that's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I kind of thought\nabout this, you know, I didn't say anything about\nit all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a\nlot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a\nvery different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because\nof the combination of where I came from and\nthen where I ended up. And so, oh, let's start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration\nargument many, many times the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been\nin DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of\ntrying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more\nhigh-skilled immigration. And, you know, I think that\nargument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, has paid off for the\nUS in many, many ways. And we can go through it,\nbut I think it's the argument everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's, right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. - So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you\ncan get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity\nof the US companies. - Yeah, and then it's not just good for the them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry,\nit's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that\nthen create many more jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would've previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Like everybody wins,\nthere are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely\nglorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be\na moral right argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against\nit is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right, I mean that-\n- Right. - That's the thing. And like I said, I've made\nthat argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd also say, look,\nI would say number one, I believe a lot of it,\nI'll talk about the parts I don't believe, but\nI believe a lot of it. And then the other part is,\nlook, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, like\nmy own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends, you know,\nare just this like amazing, you know, panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And you know, I've worked,\nI dunno at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And hopefully, over time, it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And you know, it's been amazing and they've done many of\nthe most important things in my industry and it's\nbeen really remarkable. So that's all good. And then, you know, there's\njust the practical version of the argument, which\nis we are the main place these people get educated anyway, right? The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, this is the old kind of Mitt\nRomney, staple a green card to every, you know, at least, you know, maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologist\nwe could quibble about, but you know, the roboticist\nfor sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- - At least I won you\nover on something today. - Well, no, I'm\nexaggerating for effect, so- - Oh. (Marc laughing) And I lost you,\nI had you for half a second. - I haven't gotten to the\nother side of the argument yet. - [Lex] Okay, thank you.\n- So surely, we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. - The rollercoaster is going up. - The rollercoaster is\nrationing slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists\nshould all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot\nof merit to that, obviously. Like, look, we want the\nUS to be the world leader in robotics. What step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the\ngreat robotics people, right? Like, you know, very,\nunlike the underpants. No, it's like a very\nstraightforward formula, right? - Yeah. - All right, that's all\nwell and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that you also hear from,\nyou know, these same people, and I have made this\nargument myself many times, which is, we need to do this because we don't have\nenough people in the US who can do it otherwise, right? We have all these unfilled\njobs, we've got all these, you know, all these companies\nthat wouldn't exist. We don't have enough good founders, we don't have enough engineers, we don't have enough scientists. Or then the next version\nof the argument below that is our education\nsystem is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way, 'cause like our education\nsystem is good enough for foreigners to be able\nto come here preferentially in like a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native-born people. So there's like a weird, there's\nlittle cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into and kind of wonder about, and we'll come back to that one. But like, at least, yes, our\neducation system has its flaws. And then underneath that is\nthe argument that, you know, Vivek made, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, you know, native-born\npeople in the country, you know, don't work hard enough, and spend too much time\nwatching TV and TikTok and don't spend enough\ntime studying differential, you know, equations. And again, it's like, all\nright, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair amount to that. Like there's a lot of American\nculture that is, you know, there's a lot of frivolity,\nthere's a lot of, you know, like, I mean, we have\nwell-documented social issues in many fronts, many things that cut\nagainst having a culture of just like straightforward\nhigh achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those\nare the basic arguments. But then I have this kind of\nother side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought\nprocess, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And you know, it's interesting,\nthere's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin\nto, you know, high tech. And so it's like, all right,\nwhy is that exactly, right? And then I know this, I'm an aberration. Like I was the only one\nfrom anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right? I know what an aberration I am, and I know exactly how\nthat aberration happened, and it's a very unusual,\nyou know, set of steps, including, you know,\nmany that were just luck. But like, there is in\nno sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like, not at all. There is also like, in no sense\na talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from\nthe South into high tech. There is no flow from the\nSunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the Deep South into high tech. Just like, literally it's like the blank. There's this whole section of the country that just where the people\njust like for some reason don't end up in tech. Now, that's a little bit strange, 'cause these are the people\nwho put a man on the moon. These are the people who built\nthe World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the Second\nIndustrial Revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network, and built, you know,\nlogistics and transportation in the auto in, I mean,\nthe auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people's\nparents and grandparents and great grandparents\nsomehow had the wherewithal to like build all of\nthis like amazing things, invent all these things. And then there's many,\nmany, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism\nwhere you had people who grew up in the middle of\nnowhere, Philo Farnsworth, who invented the television,\nand just like, you know, tons and tons of others,\nendless stories like this. Now you have a, like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, okay, like what is happening on\nthe blank spot of the map? And then of course, you\nalso can't help noticing that the blank spot on the\nmap, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, \"Oh,\nwell, that's interesting. Like how did that happen?\" Right? And so either you really,\nreally, really have to believe the very, very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you\nhave to believe that like, that basically culture, the\nwhole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country\nis so like, deeply flawed, either inherently flawed\nor culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they are not able to do the\nthings that their, you know, parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess\non what else is happening? - You mean what, affirmative action? - Affirmative action. Okay. (laughs) This is\nvery, think about this, this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. - Right. - Nor does it have any victims at all. - That could explain\nmaybe disproportionate, but like, surely it doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. - What educational institution\nin the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? - But what institution rejected\nfarm boys from Wisconsin? - All of them.\n- All of them. - Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this\nis because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago, these were big court cases. And you know, 'cause the\nidea of affirmative action has been litigated for\nmany, many, many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly\nin the past had upheld that it was a completely\nlegitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative action that\nlike really matter, right? One is the admissions into\neducational institutions, and then the other is jobs, right? Getting hired. Like, those are the two biggest areas. The education one is like super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time, for all, you know, people have written and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments\nfor why it's important, there's many arguments as\nto how it could backfire. It's been this thing. But the Supreme Court upheld\nit for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer, I don't\nhave the exact reference in my head, but there was a\ncase in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O'Connor famously\nwrote that, you know, although it had been 30\nyears of affirmative action, and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended,\nshe said that, you know, well, basically we need to\ntry it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically\nthe issues it's intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming\nup on the 25 years, right? It's a couple years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases is, it's a Harvard case and I think a University\nof North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those\ncases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions\nactually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit\nas cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it's a ring of power. And if you're an admissions\nofficer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power\nto do what you want, and you can justify any of\nit under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases,\nit had been a black box where you didn't have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically\nrequired showing the work. And there was like all kinds\nof like phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there\nwere text messages in there that will just curl your hair of people, of students being spoken of and just like crude racial stereotypes that would just make you\nwant to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. But also, there was\nstatistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is\nthat at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs\nfor SAT that are as wide as 400 points, right? So different groups. So a specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points\nhigher than other ethnicities in order to actually\nget admitted into these. I mean, this is not even about, I mean, white people are a part of this, but like Asians are like\na very big part of this. And actually the Harvard\ncase is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students\nwho were being turned away. And it's basically, I\nmean it's the cliche now in the valley and in\nthe medical community, which is like if you want a super genius, you hire an Asian from Harvard 'cause they are guaranteed\nto be freaking Einstein. 'Cause if they weren't, they were never getting admitted, right? Almost all the qualified\nAsians get turned away. So they've been running this,\nit's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been\na third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really\nchanged the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthey can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a\nsingle education institution in America that is conforming\nwith the Supreme Court ruling. I think they're all\nflagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. - Mostly 'cause of\nmomentum probably, or what? - They are trying to make\nthe world a better place. They're trying to solve\nall these social problems. They are trying to have\ndiverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They're trying to make\ntheir faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they're good people. - [Lex] Right. - They're trying to have\nthe press write nice things about them. Like it's nearly impossible for them. And you know, to be clear,\nlike nobody has been fired from an admissions office for,\nyou know, 25 years of prior, what we now, the Supreme Court now is\nruled to be illegality. And so they're all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so like I, you know, the numbers are moving a little bit, but like, I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they're\ncompliant with the Supreme Court. Like who's in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university's rule of the\nSupreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules\nthe universities, right? Well, another example of that is, I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right\nnow went to either Harvard or Yale, right? Like the level of\nincestuousness here is... Anyway, so there's that. And so this has been running\nfor a very long time. So one is the Harvard and\nUSC cases kind of gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the\nother thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was\nhappening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at\nall the top institutions for Jewish applicants was\nthey were being managed down, either being actively\nmanaged down as a percentage of the base. And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely\nexplicit, basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative\npercentage of the US population, which is 2%. And you know, there's\na whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago,\nJews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big\ncampaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became\n30% of these institutions 'cause there's so many\nsmart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been\ntrying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish\npeople I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, right? And so all of a sudden, so basically, the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this\nin terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in\nterms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? And then, of course, there's the thing that you\nbasically can't talk about, which is all the white\npeople are being excluded. And then it turns out it's\nalso happening to Black people, and this is the thing that like blew my freaking\nmind when I found out about it. So I just assumed that\nlike, this was great news for like American Blacks, because like, you know, obviously\nif you know Whites, Asians and Jews are being excluded,\nthen, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was\nto get the Black population up. And so this must be great\nfor American Blacks. So then I discovered this New\nYork Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? (laughs) - [Lex] Uh-oh. - And again, and by the way,\nthis is in The New York Times, this is not in like, you know, whatever, National Review,\nthis is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that\nwere quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the dean of the\nAfrican-American Studies, you know, community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme\nCourt appointee under, I think she was a close\nfriend of Hillary Clinton. And there was, for a long time, she was on the shortlist\nfor Supreme Court. So one of the top, you know, jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black was sort\nof legendarily successful in the academic and\nlegal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the\nauthorities in this story and the story that they tell, (laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education institutions and\nit's happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government, which\nis at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard\nwere not American-born Blacks. They were foreign-born Blacks, specifically, Northern\nAfrican off generally Nigerian or West Indian, right? And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very\nsuccessful Nigerian-Americans as a group like way outperformed, they're, you know, this a\nsuper smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said\nin the story is Harvard is basically struggling to\neither, whatever it was, identify or recruit, make successful, whatever it was,\nAmerican-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were\nusing high-skill immigration, as an escape hatch to go get\nBlacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs in the last 20 years have had\nthis exact characteristic. There's large numbers of\nBlack people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \"It's obviously not us that\nare getting these slots, we're literally competing with people who are being imported.\" And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action,\nyou are trying to make up for historical injustice\nof American Black slavery. So the idea that you're import\nsomebody from, you know, Nigeria that never\nexperienced that, you know, is like tremendously\ninsulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see\nwhere I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year\nsocial engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into, right? And so it turns out it's\nnot a victim-free thing, there's like 100%, there's victims. 'Cause why? There's only so many, for sure. There's only so many education slots. And then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs, right? You know, Google only\nhires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers, right? And so that's the other side of it, right? And so you're a farm\nboy in Wisconsin, right? You know, Black American\nwhose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship,\n300 years ago, in Louisiana or a, you know, Cambodian\nimmigrant in, you know, the Bronx and you are a kid or a Jewish\nimmigrant or a, you know, or from a very successful Jewish family and you know, your entire, you\nknow, for three generations, you and your parents and\ngrandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those\ngroups know is the system that has been created\nis not for them, right? It's designed specifically\nto exclude them. And then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, \"Yeah, let's bring\nin more foreigners,\" right? And so anyway, so the\nshort version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the, quote,\n\"high-skill immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also\nhaving the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another\nword for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative\naction conversation. And you need to actually\ndeal with this at substance and to see what's actually\nhappening to people. you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for\nhigh-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took\nover both the education process and the hiring process.\n- Okay, so first of all, that was brilliantly laid\nout, the nuance of it. So just to understand, it's\nnot so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to\nbe more people saying, yay, we need more American-born hires. - So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on\nthis and not saying anything, and what I was... (Lex laughing) Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of- - Yeah, that was very Zen. - Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of\nit, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the\ndog that didn't bark, right? And the dog that didn't\nbark was, I did not, and you tell me if you saw one, I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart\nkids who are already here into these educational\ninstitutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. - That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.\n- But it was like literally, it was like the proponents\nof high-skilled immigrant. And again, this was me\nfor a very long time. I mean, I kind of took\nmyself by surprise on this because I was on, you\nknow, I had the much, say, simpler version of this\nstory for a very... And like I said, I've been\nin Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But you know, I've been on\nthe other side of this one, but I was literally sitting\nthere being like, all right, which of these like super\ngeniuses who, you know, many of whom by the\nway are very, you know, successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled\nimmigrants, you know, which of these super\ngeniuses are gonna like, say actually we have this like\nincredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about native-born\nAmericans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure. Those four groups. - But also-\n- Yes. - White people. - Yeah, and also white people. - People that are making the\ncase for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're\nmaking that case are often not making it in a way that's like, making it in quite a radical way. - Yeah.\n- Let's put it this way. - Yeah, but you have\nthis interesting thing, you have a split between\nthe sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. - Right. - Right, and I'm using air\nquote for people listening to audio. I'm making quotes\nin the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can.\n- Yep. - One side has all the certified experts. The other side just has a\nbunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite\nknow how to explain it. And what was so unusual\nabout the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of Supreme Court, is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time, actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record, they actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, 'cause if you don't have\nexperts, what do you have? You know, something is wrong, but you have primarily\nan emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, you know, that\na certified expert can? And no, you can't, like, you\nknow, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. Yeah, and so it's just\nlike, all right, now, by the way, look, I think there are ways\nto square the circle, I think there's a way to\nhave our cake and eat it too, like I think there'd be\nmany ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with\nhigh-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is\nunder much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for\nuniversities to do that, they are still doing it,\nbut they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part, that's happening\nfor a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate\nlawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court\nrulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just as a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let add one more nuance to it that makes it even more complicated. - Yeah. - So the cliche is we're gonna\nbrain drain the world, right? You've heard that? We're gonna take all the smart people from all over the world,\nwe're gonna bring them here, we're gonna educate them, and\nthen we're gonna keep them, and then they're gonna\nraise their families here, create businesses here,\ncreate jobs here, right? - In the cliche, that's\na super positive thing. - Yeah. Okay, so what happens to\nthe rest of the world? - They lose? - Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious,\nhighly conscientious, highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that\nmany and they all come here and they all aren't where\nthey would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So it's almost impossible\nfor us here to have that conversation, in part because we become\nincredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just\nsimply all the same, which is a whole thing\nwe could talk about. But it also, we are purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the\nworld, not the other way around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow\nof high-skilled immigration over time, there's only\nfour permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration\nplaces people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. - Oh, Australia. - It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four\ncountries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk\nabout this I've discovered because the Eurozone\nis, whatever, you know, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over\ntime have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I\nthink it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've\nbeen migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this\nreally hit the fan was in Greece, right? So, you know, Greece falls\ninto chaos, disaster, and then, you know, you're\nrunning the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic\ndevelopment plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. Like, what are you gonna do, right? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. Not because, in part, because of this, 'cause we enthusiastically\nrecruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining\nUkraine for a long time. But also, of course,\nyou know, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, you know, when it comes\ntime for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it\ngonna have the talent base even that it had five years ago is like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, like\nwe have brain drained a lot of really smart people outta Russia, a lot of them are here, right? Over the last, you know, 30 years. And so there's this thing, it's actually really funny\nif you think about it. Like, the one thing that\nwe know to be the height of absolute evil that the\nWest ever did was colonization and resource extraction, right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and\nthe English and you know, everybody else went and had\nthese colonies and then went in and we, you know, took all the oil and we took all the diamonds,\nor we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason we realized\nthat's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's\ncompletely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious\nand beautiful and wonderful and you know, the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral\njustice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one\nsecond what we're doing to the countries that we're\npulling all these people out of. And this is one of these\nthings like, I don't know, like maybe we're just gonna live in this delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't care what happens, but like, I think there may come, this is like one of these submarines 10 feet under the waterline. Like, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly\nrealize, \"Oh, my God, what are we doing?\" 'Cause like, we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? Like we need these other\ncountries to like flourish. Like we don't wanna be the\nonly successful country in the middle of just like\ncomplete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and\nwe extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it. - Well, this is so deeply\nprofound, actually. So what is the cost\n\"winning\" quote, unquote, if these countries are drained\nin terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics,\nwhat does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually\nwant them to be strong in the way we understand\nstrong, not just in every way. So that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. - Yep. - It's interesting, this is one of those\ntruths where you just speak and it resonates, and I\ndidn't even think about it. - [Marc] Yeah, exactly. - So you were sitting\nduring the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that said-\n- Yeah. - There's still to use\nsome good to the H-1B? - Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's- - Come all the way around. (laughs) - There's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance,\nwhich is mostly the valley, we don't use H-1Bs anymore,\nmostly we use O-1s. So there's a separate class of these, and the O-1 is like this, it turns out the O-1 is\nthe super genius visa. So the O-1 is the basically our founder, like when we have somebody\nfrom anywhere in the world and they've like invented a\nbreakthrough new technology, and they wanna come to\nthe US to start a company, they come in through an O-1 visa. And that actually is like\na, it's a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, but it's like a pretty high\nbar. And they do a lot of work and there's like a, you have\nto put real work into it and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened\nwith the H-1B visa program is that it has gone to\nbasically two categories of employers. One is the basically a small\nset of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies\nthat you would think. And then the other is, it goes to these, they call kind of the mills,\nthe consulting mills, right? And so there's these set\nof companies with names, I don't wanna pick on\ncompanies, but you know, names like Cognizant that, you know, hire, basically have their business model is bring in primarily\nIndians in large numbers, and you know, they often have, you know, offices next to company-owned housing. And they'll have, you know,\norganizations that are, you know, they'll have,\nyou know, organizations that are literally thousands\nof Indians, you know, living and working in the US and they do basically call it\nmid-tier, like IT consulting. So you know, these folks,\nthey're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a year or $100,000 a year, not the, you know, 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, like in practice, the startups, basic like\nlittle tech as we call it, or the startup world,\nmainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point and mainly can't, 'cause the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of\nunderlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, you know, Amazon, like Amazon's a\nin like I love Amazon, but like they're a big powerful company. You know, they've got, you\nknow, more money than God. They've got resources, they've got long-term\nplanning horizon, they do big, you know, profound things over,\nyou know, decades at a time. You know, they could, you know, or any of these other companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you know, you'll\nnotice they don't do that. You know, they bring in, you know, 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, like,\nthere's lots of questions around them and whether\nthey should, you know, whether that's even a\nethical way to, you know, I don't wanna say they're\nunethical, but there's questions around like exactly what\nthe trade-offs are there. Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, you know, nobody\nreally wanted to be opened, you know, to play devil's\nadvocate on all this in terms of like national\nimmigration issues, you know, none of this is like a top end issue just 'cause the numbers are small, right? And so, you know, I don't think, you know, the administration has said like, this is not like a priority\nof theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is like, there is actually a lot of\ncomplexity and nuance here. I have a lot of friends,\nlike I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues\nwho are, you know, who came over on H-1Bs,\nor O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens and you know, every single\none that one of them was not every single one, a lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the honor of immigrants throughout\nthis whole period. And they said to me,\nit's like, \"Well, Marc, you know, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance\nof high-skilled immigration to the US?\" And I was like, I think\nyou can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent and be like, do you\nwanna inflame the issue or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right? And I think the answer\nis to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one\nmore positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up\non the university some more. Do you know about the National\nMerit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? - Not really, can you explain? - So there's a system that was\ncreated during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when... It was when people in\ngovernment actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an ideas that sounds today. And so it's basically a\nnational talent search for basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify\nbasically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of\nother characteristics. So there's no race, gender,\nor any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory\nSAT that you take, and then the SAT. So it uses those scores,\nthat is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. So they use the SAT as a\nproxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to like 1% of\nthe population of the kids, 18 year olds any given year\nwho scored highest on the PSAT, and then they get down to\nlike further qualify down to the 0.5% that also\nreplicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right? So it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the\nbest and the brightest. How many of our great and\npowerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities\nall have sports teams, they all have national scouting,\nthey have full-time scouts who go out and they go\nto every high school and they try to find all\nthe great basketball players and bring them into the\nNCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities\nuse the National Merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids\nand just bring them in? - Let me guess, very few. Zero.\n- Zero. (laughs) - As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that\nsame level of scouting for talent internally. - Go get the smartest ones. I'll give you one more\nkicker on this topic if I haven't beaten it to death. You know, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a\nhighly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like\nthe whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the\ncollege board that runs it. And it has been essentially\nlike everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so the in two ways, number one, it's been dumbed down where\nan 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost\nimpossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, right? And so, it's been\ndeliberately dumbed down. And then two is they have tried to pull out a lot of what's\ncalled the g-loading. And so they've tried to detach\nit from being an IQ proxy 'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable, right? So the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has\nreally started to work. And one of the things you\nsee is the Asian spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is\nbecause it's more coachable now. And the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the coaching\nthing is really difficult 'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents\ncan afford coaching, right? And I don't know about\nyou, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT\nwas until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. So, number one, there's issues there, but the other issue there is\nthink about what's happened by the dumbing down,\n800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It's like the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they\nhave AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. 'Cause what you want\nis you want, whatever, if it's gonna be 100,000\nkids, I don't know what it is, it's gonna be 50,000\nkids a year scoring 800. You also then want kids\nto be able to score 900 and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200, and you wanna ultimately get to, you know, you'd like to ultimately\nidentify the top 100 kids and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the\ntest has been reduced, so that it actually is\nnot useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption that's taken place\nthroughout this entire system where we have been heading\nin the reverse direction from wanting to actually go\nget the best and brightest and actually put them in the\nplaces where they should be. And then just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System\nis it's comp, like I said, it's completely race\nblind, it's gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic. It's only done on test scores. You know, and you can make\nan argument about whether that's good or bad, but\nit is, you know, for sure, you know, it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed\nmerit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose\nto do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it like incredibly striking and an enormous moral\nindictment of the current system that there are no universities\nthat do this today. So back to the immigration\nthing, just real quick. It's like, okay, we aren't even trying\nto go get the smart kids out of the center of-\n- Yeah. - And even if they think that they can get into these\nplaces, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for\nthe smart Black people. And like, it's just like,\nI don't know how, like, I don't know how that's moral. Like I don't get it at all. - As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times and I've always gotten\nperfect on math, 800. And I'm not that I'm not special like, it doesn't identify genius. I think you wanna search for genius and you wanna create\nmeasures that find genius of all different kinds,\nspeaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and\nover, defend immigrants. Yes. But say we should hire\nmore and more native-born. - Well, you asked me in the beginning like what's the most optimistic\nforecast, right, that we could have? And the most optimistic\nforecast would be, my God, what if we did both? (laughs) - So that's the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. - Well, it would diffuse the entire issue. - [Lex] Yeah. - If everybody in the center\nin the South of the country and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they\nwere getting a fair shake, like it would diffuse the issue. Like how about diffusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical... Sorry, I don't mean to really get out over my skis here, but- - I think your profile on X\nstates, \"It's time to build.\" It feels like 2025 is\na good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for\nanybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build\nsomething useful in the world or maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch\napps, services, whatever, ship software products. So maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? - So I mean, a big part\nof the answer I think is we're in the middle\nof a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking\nabout this on your show, but like AI coding, I mean,\nthis is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the investment of software. And I'm sure you, and you\nknow, we're involved in various of these companies, but\nyou know, these tools, you know, from a variety of companies are just like absolutely revolutionary and they're getting better by\nleaps and bounds every day. And you know, all this, but like the thing with coding, like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever. But like for sure, we\ncan make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate\nthe results of coding. And so, you know, there's all\nthese methods of, you know, synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is gonna get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean\nanybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and\nlook at AI coding demos, you know, little kids\nmaking apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. I mean I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary. You know, in a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain\nyourself, you know, start using these things, get\na huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more\nquickly than you could before. - That's actually a tricky\none in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like\nyou still need to learn how to code, it becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately\nbe a one person company and get quite far. - I agree with that, up to a point. So I think, for sure,\nfor quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are gonna be the best at\nactually having AI's code things, 'cause they're gonna understand\nwhat I mean, very basic. They're gonna understand\nwhat's happening, right? And they're gonna be able\nbe able to evaluate the work and they're gonna be able to, you know, literally like manage AIs better. Like even if they're not\nliterally handwriting the code, they're just gonna have\na much better sense of what's going on. So I definitely think\nlike 100% my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds of coding classes, and he'll keep doing that\nfor certainly through 18. We'll see after that. And so like for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you\ncan do with an AI is say, teach me how to code, right? And you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, I'll name names,\nyou know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing at\nKhan Academy for free. And then we, you know, we\nhave this company, Replit, which is was originally\nspecifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that's just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this and yeah, that, I mean, the\nAI's gonna be able to teach you to code, AI, by the way, is as you know, spectacularly good at\nexplaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools\nhave these features now where you can talk to the code base and so you can like literally like ask the code base\nquestions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and\npaste code into ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it\nwhat's going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so yeah, there's\ndozens of ways to do this. By the way, you can also, I mean even more broadly than code. Like, okay, you wanna make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art\ngeneration, sound generation, dialogue generation,\nvoice generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like,\nyou don't need designers, you know, you don't need, you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then, you know, a big is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's interfacing\ninto other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments\nor something like that. And, you know, AI's fantastic\nat writing glue code. So, you know, really,\nreally good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you\nfigure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write\na business plan for you. So it's just this, it's\nlike everything happening with AI right now, it's just, it's like this latent superpower and there's this incredible\nspectrum of people who have really figured out\nmassive performance increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't\neven aware it's happening. And there's some gearing to\nwhether you're a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races. And I think there are lots\nof professional coders who are still like, eh... You know, the blacksmiths were\nnot necessarily in favor of, you know, the car business. So yeah, there's the old\nWilliam Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just\nnot evenly distributed yet.\" And this is maybe the most\npotent version of that that I've ever seen. - Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" - Right.\n- It is very common. The programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true. I consider myself\nreasonably good programmer, and my productivity has\nbeen just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming\nis more efficient, more productive, more fun,\nall that kind of stuff. - I would also say code is, you know, code has of anything in\nlike industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the\neasier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's\nunlimited demand for code. Like, in other words, like\nthere's always some other idea for a thing that you can do,\na feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, like overwhelmingly, you know, the amount of code that\nexists in the world is a fraction of even\nthe ideas we have today. And then we come up with\nnew ideas all the time. And so I think that\nlike, (laughs) you know, I was in the late '80s, early '90s, when sort of automated\ncoding systems started to come out, expert systems,\na big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called the \"Decline and Fall of the\nAmerican Programmer,\" you know, that predicted that\nthese new coding systems were gonna mean we wouldn't\nhave programmers in the future. And of course, the number\nof programming jobs exploded by like a factor of 100. Like, my guess is we'll have\nmore coding jobs probably by like an order magnitude\n10 years from now. That will be different,\nthey'll be different jobs. They'll involve orchestrating\nAI, but there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry\nwill just explode in size. - Are you seeing the size\nof companies decrease in terms of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? - All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. - [Lex] Oh, for the big tech? - And little tech.\n- And little tech. - Everybody's trying to\nhire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it's 100%. I mean, there's a handful\nof company, you know, there's a little bit,\nthere's customer service, you know, we have some\ncompanies and others 'cause I think it's\nKlarna that's publicizing a lot of this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. But like for engineering jobs, like, it's just an explosion of hiring that at least, so far, there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am\nlooking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first\ncompany to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. So basically, the companies that we see are\nbasically one of two kinds. We see the companies that are basically sometimes\nuse weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies,\nI sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point\non whatever they're doing. - (laughs) Sure. - Right? And it's on the slide, right?\n- Yeah. - So they've got the, you know, whatever, da, da, da, da, da, and then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is, 'cause they had already\npreviously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the\nsix bullet point in the slide, which is how you're\ngetting all these products that have like the AI button\nup in the corner, right? The little sparkly button. - Yep.\n- Right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which\nI'm like, I don't need that. Like, I need you to answer\nmy email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay, so we see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then we see the strong\nform, which is the companies that are building from\nscratch for AI, right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally\nan AI email system, as an example, so just- - Oh, nice. I can't wait. - Yeah, they're gonna completely. So the very obvious idea,\nvery smart team, you know, it's gonna be great. And then, you know,\nNotion, just, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a\nproduct. And so now companies are gonna basically come through, sweep through, and they're gonna do\nbasically AI-first versions of basically everything. And those are like\ncompanies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. - Yeah, Cursor is an example of that. They basically said, okay,\nwe're gonna rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. - What if we knew from scratch\nthat we could build on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the Full Employment Act\nfor startups and VCs is, it just like if a\ntechnology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development\nprocess over from scratch, 'cause you need to\nreconceptualize the product, and then usually what that\nmeans is you need a new company 'cause most incumbents just won't do that. And so, yeah. So that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for is the\ncompany where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned\nas a result of AI, right? So I'm looking at, I'm\nwaiting for the company where it's like, no, we're\ngonna have, like, you know, and the cliche, here's a\nthought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're gonna have like the human executive team, and then we're gonna have the\ntheis be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of engineering\nsupervising 100 instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right by the way, or maybe the VP of\nengineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs, right? 'Cause one of the things that\nAI should be pretty good at is managing 'cause it's\nlike not, you know, it's like a process-driven,\nit's the kind of thing that AI's actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so should it be an AI executive team? You know, and then, of\ncourse, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, right? You know, and then maybe\nthe most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set\none of these things loose and let it basically\nbuild itself a business? And so I will say like\nwe're not yet seeing those, and I think there's a little bit of, the systems aren't quite\nready for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, like a founder who's really willing to break all the rules and\nreally willing to take the swing. And those people exist, and\nso I'm sure we'll see that. - And some of it is, as you\nknow, with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have\na AI-first email client, seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail\nis really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google\ncan't do it, because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer\nthe entirety of the system. 'Cause feels like Google's\nperfectly positioned to do it. Same with like, you have\nPerplexity, which I love, like Google could technically\ntake on Perplexity and do it much better,\nbut they haven't, not yet. So it's fascinating why\nthat is for large companies. I mean that is an\nadvantage for little tech, they could be agile. - Yeah, that's right.\n- They can move fast. - Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can't-\n- Right. - This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in\n\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which is sometimes when big\ncompanies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too much glass. It would specifically, it would interfere with\ntheir existing customers and their existing businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly,\nthey shouldn't do that, right? And so they just get, this is Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they're well-run, not\nbecause they're poorly run. But they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing against\nthe existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Like every once in a while, one breaks the pattern\nand actually does it. But for the most part, like this is a very predictable\nform of human behavior, and this fundamentally\nis why startups exist. - It feels like 2025 is\nwhen the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. Like, it's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI. Who do you think wins the AI race? - I would say, I'm not gonna predict, I'm gonna say there's\nquestions all over the place. And then we have this\ncategory question we call the trillion-dollar\nquestion, which is like, literally depending on how it's answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there's like, I don't know, 5 or $6 trillion questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I'll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small models. Another is open models\nversus closed models. Another is whether you can\nuse synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political\ntrillion-dollar questions. You know, policy\nquestions, which, you know, the US and the EU have both\nbeen flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is\nabout to really succeed at. Yeah, and then there's\nprobably another, you know, half dozen big important\nquestions after that. And so these are all just\nlike, say, this is an industry that's in flux in a way\nthat I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious\nexample of the flux is you know, sitting here\nless than three years ago, sitting here in December of '22, we would've said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today,\nit's like, you know, there's at least six, you know, world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of\nthe most shocking things to me, is like, it turns out that once\nyou know that it's possible to build one incredibly\nsmart Turning-test-passing large language model,\nwhich was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it\nturns out within, you know, a year, you can have five more. There's also a money\ncomponent thing to it, which is to get the money\nto scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There's basically right now\nonly two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers\ngiving you the money, which you turn around and\nroundtrip back to them. Or, you know, foreign\nsovereigns, other, you know, country sovereign wealth\nfunds, which can be, you know, difficult in some\ncases, for companies to access. So there's maybe another\ntrillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here's one. So Sam Altman has been\npublic about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a nonprofit,\nbeing a for-profit. The way that is legally done is that, and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and and other legal entities, government entities,\nscrutinizes very carefully, 'cause the US takes foundation\nnonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so the way that historically, the way that you do it\nis you start a for-profit and then you raise money\nwith the for-profit to buy the assets of the\nnonprofit at fair market value. And, you know, the last\nfinancing round at OpenAI was, you know, 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the\nflip is going to happen, the for-profit has to\ngo raise $150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. You know, raising 150\nbillion is a challenge. So, you know, is that even possible? If that is possible, then\nOpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, you know, I don't know. And then, you know,\nobviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the\nmarket leader today, you know, there's big important questions there. You know, Microsoft has this\nkind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind, but you know, they're\nvery good at catching up. Amazon, you know, is\nprimarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. - And then there's the other questions, like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly,\nopen versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. And then test on compute\nwith chain of thought. They're all of that. And it's just fascinating. And these are, I think it's fair to say,\ntrillion-dollar questions. - Yeah, these are big, like\nlook, you know, it's like, okay, here's a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations, right? Like, so if you are trying to\nuse these tools creatively, you're thrilled because\nthey can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this\nincredible stuff, right? They're creative. The flip side of that is if\nyou need them to be correct, they can't be creative. And that's, you know,\nthe term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And you know, there have been,\nyou know, court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court\ncitations, case citations. The judge is like, \"Wait a\nminute, this doesn't exist.\" And the very next is, \"Did\nyou write this yourself?\" And the lawyer goes, \"Er-\" (laughs) - I mean that's why with Elon, with Grok-\n- Yes. - Looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? - Yeah, that's right. And my sense is this very\ncontentious topic at the industry, my sense is if to the extent that there is a domain in\nwhich there is a definitive and checkable provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to\ngenerate synthetic data. You should be able to do\nchain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do\nreinforcement learning, and you should be able\nto ultimately, you know, eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that's a trillion-dollar\nquestion right there as to whether that's true. But then there's question of like, okay, is that gonna work in\nthe more general domain? Like, so for example, one\npossibility is these things are gonna get truly superhuman\nlike math and coding. But at like discussing\nphilosophy, they're gonna just, they're basically as smart\nas they're ever gonna be. And they're gonna be kind of, you know, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they're already outta training data. Like they literally, if, you know, you talk to these people,\nlike literally the big models, the big models are like\nwithin a factor of 2X of consuming all the\nhuman-generated training data to the point that some of these big companies are\nliterally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean\nthat like you have to, if you want your model\nto better philosophy, you have to go hire like\na thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody gonna do that? And so, you know, maybe these things are\ntopping out in certain ways and they're gonna leap\nway ahead in other ways. And so anyway, so we just\ndon't, you know, this is... Actually, maybe my main\nmain conclusion is, anybody telling, you know, anybody telling you these\nbig sweeping conclusions, you know, this whole super, you know, all of these abstract\ngeneralized super intelligence AGI stuff like, you know, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like, that's to abstract like,\nit's gotta actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have\nto be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem\nright now with the, you know, the big models that are like\nreally good at coding and math, they're like actually very\nexpensive to run, you know, they're quite slow. Another trillion-dollar\nquestion, future chips, which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean, all the global issue. Oh, another trillion-dollar\nquestion censorship, right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly, what are you\ntraining these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long did they give you these... How often do they give you these incredibly preaching moral lectures? Here's a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries\nwant their country to run its education system,\nhealthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing\nCalifornia politics, right? 'Cause that's kind of what\nthey have on offer right now. And I think the answer\nto that is not very many. So there's like massive\nopen questions there about like what, you know, and by\nthe way, like what morality of these things are gonna\nget trained on as a- - And that one we're cracking wide open with what's been happening\nover the past few months. Censorship on every\nlevel of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to be expand\nthe Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. - So what I experienced,\nyou know, going back to how we started, what I\nexperienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at like large scale, and then the war on the crypto\nindustry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared\nintent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under\nthe same kind of censorship and control regime as\nsocial media and the banks. And I think this election\ntipped, in America, I think this election\ntipped us from a timeline in which things were going to\nget really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are gonna be quite good. But look, those same questions\nalso apply outside the US and you know, the EU is doing their thing, they're being extremely draconian and they're trying to lock in\na political censorship regime on AI right now that's so harsh that even American AI\ncompanies are not even willing to launch new products\nin the EU right now. Like, that's not gonna last, but like, what happens there, right? And what are the trade-offs? You know, what levels of censorship are American companies\ngonna have to sign up for if they wanna operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them,\n(laughs) so that they can't? So big questions. - Quick questions. So you're very active on X. A very unique character, flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a meme, I\ndon't remember it exactly, but that Elon posted\nsomething like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I\nthink, you know, doing the, I take a big step back and\nfuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside\nyour mind when you're tweeting? - To be clear, a reference from the comedy\nclassic \"Tropic Thunder.\" - \"Tropic Thunder,\" yeah. Legendary movie. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Any Zoomers listening\nto this who haven't seen that movie, go watch it immediately. - Yeah, there's nothing\noffensive about it. - Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise's greatest performance. (Lex laughing) So-\n- Yeah. - Yeah, no, look, I should\nstart by saying like, I'm not supposed to be\ntweeting at all, so- - Yeah.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So, but, you know. - So how do you approach that? Like how do you approach what to tweet? - I mean, I don't. I don't well enough. It's mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there's a glory to it and there's an issue with it,\nand the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global\ncommunication, you know, X in particular is, you know, the town square on all these,\nyou know, social issues, political issues, everything\nelse, current events. But I mean, look, there's\nno question of the format. The format of at least\nthe original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I was tweeted something. It turned out that it's\nstill politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news\nin each time zone in India for a single tweet. So like, the single tweet outta context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously, X now has the\nmiddle ground where they, you know, they now have\nthe longer form essays. And so, you know, probably\nthe most productive thing I can do is longer form things. - You're not gonna do it though, are you? - [Marc] I do, I do,\nfrom time-to-time. I do. - Sometimes.\n- I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean,\nlook, but, and yeah, and obviously, X is doing great. And then, like I said,\nlike Substack, you know, has become the center for a\nlot, you know, a lot of the, I think the best kind of,\nyou know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly\nintellectual content, you know, tons of current events\nstuff there as well. And then, yeah, so, and then there's a bunch\nof other, you know, a bunch of new systems\nthat are very exciting. So I think one of the\nthings we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive\nreinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen with that. And it's happened on X, but it's now gonna happen\non other platforms. And then the other is crypto's gonna come right back to life. And actually that's\nvery exciting, actually, that's worth noting is that's another\ntrillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal\neconomic system for that, right? 'Cause it's a programmable money, it's a very easy way\nto plug in and do that. And there's this transaction\nprocessing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto\nAI intersection, you know, is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was gonna be\nimpossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do. - Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite\nthings about Yann LeCun? (Marc laughing) I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree\non a lot of things, but I personally like\nvigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the\ngladiators go at it, and- - No, he's a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn't\nsay we're super close, but you know, casual friends. I worked with him at Meta, you know, he is the chief scientist\nat Meta for a long time and is still, you know, works with us. And obviously is a legendary\nfigure in the field and one of the main people\nresponsible for what's happening. My serious observation would be that it's the thing I keep,\nI've talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does\nis he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree\nwith this, he is the smartest and most credible critic\nof LLMs is the path for AI. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's not, you know, there's certain, I would say troll-like characters who are just like crapping everything. But like Yann has like very\ndeeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. And I actually, like,\nI try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,\nI try to have a mental model of like the two different\nsides of a serious argument. And so I've tried to like\ninternalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult 'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like\nthat could be a big problem. But like, we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the\nbullish people, you know, to really kind of test\ntheir level of knowledge. So I like to kind of grill people. Like, you know, I was got\nmy CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like to the extent I can\nunderstand Yann's points, I can use them to, you know,\nto really surface a lot of the questions for the\npeople who are more bullish. And that's been, I think,\nvery, very productive. Yeah, just, and it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, who is actually like a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he\nwill provoke the evolution of these systems to be much\nbetter than they would've been. - Yeah, he could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the\nLLM path to AGI, you know, his basic notions that\nthere needs AI needs to have some physical understanding\nof the physical world, and that's very difficult\nto achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations\nof LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source.\n- Yes. - Which is a whole nother-\n- Yes. - Which you have been as well. - [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah. - And that's been just\nfascinating to watch. - [Marc] And anti-doomer. - Anti-doomer?\n- Yeah. - Yeah, he's-\n- He's very anti-doomer. - He embodies... He also has many wolves inside. - [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes, he does. Yes, does. - So it's been really,\nreally fun to watch. - The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. - [Lex] Yeah. - The other two of the\nthree godfathers of AI are like radicals, like full-on left, you know,\nfar left, you know, like, I would say like either\nMarxists or borderline Marxists. And they're like, I think, quite extreme in\ntheir social political views. And I think that feeds\ninto their doomerism, and I think, you know, they are lobbying for\nlike draconian government, I think what would be ruinously\ndestructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Yann as a\ncounterpoint to those two. - Another fun question, our\nmutual friend Andrew Huberman. - [Marc] Yes. - First maybe, what do you\nlove most about Andrew? And second, what score\non a scale of 1 to 10 do you think he would give you\non your approach to health? - Oh, three. - Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.\n- (laughs) Exactly. - That's good. (laughs)\n- Exactly. Well, so he convinced me\nto stop drinking alcohol, which was a big-\n- Successfully? - Well, it was like other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world.\n- Yeah. - And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night, it was like a major, like, it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly\nnegatively impacted my emotional health. (Lex laughing) I blame him-\n- Yeah. - For making me much\nless happy as a person. But much, much, much healthier. - Yeah.\n- Physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have no interest in\nhis sleep shit. Like, no. This whole light, natural light, no, we're not doing it. - You're too hardcore for this? - I don't see any natural light in here. - [Lex] It's all covered. It's all horrible. - And I'm very happy. I would be very happy\nliving and working here 'cause I'm totally happy\nwithout natural light. - In darkness.\n- Yes. - It must be a metaphor for something. - Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have\na blue screen in your face for three hours and\nthen go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why you should wanna take shortcuts. - I now understand what they\nmean by toxic masculinity. All right. (both laughing) So let's see. You're exceptionally\nsuccessful by most measures, but what to you is the\ndefinition of success? - I would probably say it is\na combination of two things, I think it is contribution. So, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately, you know, and specifically\nit mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not\nmean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said, \"Pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to\nsatisfaction or fulfillment. And so I think about happiness as the first ice cream\ncone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice\ncream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of\nthe walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Right, and so happiness is\nthis very fleeting concept, and the people who\nanchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I dunno how to put it useful. - So that's a good place\nto arrive at in life. - Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah. You know, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But like, if you're sitting in a room by yourself and you're like, all right. Or you know, four in the\nmorning, it's like, all right, have I lived up to my\nexpectation of myself? Like if you have, you know,\nthe people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and, you know, generally seem\nvery, I dunno how to put it, pleased with, you know,\nproud, calm, at peace. The people who are, you\nknow, sensation seekers, you know, some of the sensations\nby the way, some sense, you know, there's certain\nentrepreneurs, for example, who are like into every\nform of extreme sport and they get, you know, huge\nsatisfaction out of that. Or, you know, there's sensation seeking in sort of useful and productive ways. You know, Larry Ellison\nwas always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, there's\na lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know,\ndrugs, (laughs) you know, like you know, sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun\nat first and then backfire. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM- - [Marc] Yeah.\n- And I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM- - Yeah.\n- With a blue screen. - That's good. Exactly. - Staring at cursor.\n- Exactly. - As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an\namazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and\njust to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called,\n\"Honestly, with Bari Weiss.\" She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys... See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. - [Marc] Thank you. - So this question is designed for many of the questions today\nwere designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause\nthat you're not sure. So it felt like the\npause, the uncertainty, there was some kind of\nongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching\nfor wisdom and meaning? - I guess I'd put it this way. There's a lot to just\nunderstand about people that I feel like I'm only\nstarting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler\nconcept than God. (laughs) So that's what I've spent a\nlot of the last, you know, 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my\nfirst like whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I'm spending 30\nyears figuring out people, which turns out to be quite\na bit more complicated. And then, I don't know,\nmaybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look,\nI mean just, you know, like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is like\nvery, you know, complicated and, you know, mystifying. I mean, every time I, you\nknow, pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, you know, \"Daddy, how many galaxies\nare there in the universe?\" And you know, how many galaxies are\nthere in the universe? - 100 billion?\n- Okay. Like how? (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - Like-\n- Yeah. - Like how that freaking possible? Like it's such a\nstaggering concept that I- - I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from\nElon from a while back. Elon, said, \"As a friend called it, this\nis the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies, a billion light years across.\"\n- Yeah. - So these are all galaxies.\n- Yeah. Like how was it that big? Like how the hell, and like, you know, I can read the textbook\nand the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion\nyears and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all\nrights, the Big Bang. All right, like what was\nbefore the Big Bang? (laughs) - Do you think we humans will\never colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? - Sure. Yeah, I mean,\nin the fullness of time. Yeah. - So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across a thousand of-\n- In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah, you know, all the problem, all the\nchallenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it'll take a long time. - You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? - No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately\nwe have Elon giving us, (Lex laughing) giving us the backup plan. So I don't know, like,\nI grew up, you know, real Midwest, sort of\njust like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an\nengineer and a scientist. I'm like, \"Oh, that definitely\ndoesn't make sense.\" I'm like, \"I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll figure everything out.\" And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against\nthese things, you know, you bump up against these things and you're just like, \"All right,\" I like, \"Okay, I guess there's\na scientific explanation for this, but like, wow.\" And then there's like, \"All right, where did that come from?\" Right, and then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean,\nand even just, you know, experiences that we all have on earth, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, I guess I just say I'm kind\nof radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that\nI'll probably never know. The other thing though, that's happened, and maybe the more practical\nanswer to the question is I think I have a much\nbetter understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great... I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, \"If a man does\nnot have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\" And so there's this class,\nit's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing\npoint of view, which is, \"Yes, I'm an atheist,\nbut it's very important that the people believe in something.\" Right? And Marx had like the\nnegative view on that, which is religions the\nopiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like\nright-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it's deeply important that the people be Christian\nor something like that. And on the one hand it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right because, you know, what have we learned in the last 100 years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's\nthis political philosopher who's super interesting on\nthis named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the sort\nof mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was like born in, I think, like 1900, and like died in like '85. So he saw the complete run\nof communism and Nazism and himself, you know, I think he fled Europe and\nyou know, the whole thing. And you know, his sort of\nbig conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but like in the deep way of religions. Like, you know, we call\n'em political religions, but they were like actual religions. And you know, they were\nwhat Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, \"God is dead. We've killed him, and we won't\nwash the blood off our hands for 1,000 years,\" right? Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just\nmass murder and death. And like, you read his stuff now and you're like, \"Yep,\n(laughs) that happened.\" Right? And then, of\ncourse, as fully, you know, elite moderates, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing\nthat for ourselves right now, but of course, we are. And you know, I would argue\nthat Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the\nlast 10 years, you know, we have been in a\nreligious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full\nscale religious frenzy and has had all of the\ncharacteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to, you know, sin. Wokeness has said, every, I think, has said every single aspect of an actual religion other\nthan redemption, right? Which is maybe like the\nmost dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's\nno forgiveness, right? And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would've\nzeroed right in on that, would've said that. And, you know, we just\nlike sailed right off. I mentioned earlier like\nwe somehow rediscovered the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity\npolitics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, like there is\nsomething very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and\nneeds to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles\nwith the specifics of it. - I think I speak for a lot of people that it's been a real joy and for me, an honor to get to\nwatch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You're in that 30-year part of your life, and it's been an honor\nto talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That's only, how long is that? - Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so- - I'll accept being one of the short ones. (both laughing) - For the listener. Marc looks like he's ready\nto go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. (laughs) Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen.

Marc is a visionary\ntech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the\ntech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential\nvoices in the tech world, including at the intersection\nof technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the\nbest possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small\ntech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario\ntrajectory for America. - The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.\n- The roaring '20s. I mean, look, couple things. It is remarkable over\nthe last several years with all of the issues\nincluding, you know, not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every\nother thing that's happened. It's really amazing, the United\nStates just kept growing. If you just look at\neconomic growth charts, the US just kept growing,\nand very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing,\nGermany has stopped growing, and you know, some of those countries may be actually growing\nbackwards at this point. And there's a very long\ndiscussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's of course, plenty of things that are\nwrong with our country, but the US is just flat\nout primed for growth. And I think that's a consequence\nof many factors, you know, some of which are lucky and\nsome of which through hard work. And so the lucky part is\njust, you know, number one, you know, we just have like\nincredible physical security by being our own continent. You know, we have incredible\nnatural resources, right? There's this running joke now that like, whenever it looks like\nthe US is gonna run out of some like rare earth\nmaterial, you know, some farmer in North Dakota\nlike kicks over a hay bale and finds like a $2 trillion deposit. Right, I mean, we're just like blessed, you know, with geography\nand with natural resources. Energy. You know, we can be energy\nindependent anytime we want. This last administration\ndecided they didn't wanna be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has\ndeclared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There's no question we\ncan be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It's purely a question of choice, and I think the new\nadministration's gonna do that. And oh, and then I would\nsay two other things. One is, you know, we\nare the beneficiaries, and, you know, you're an example of this. We're a beneficiary. We're the beneficiary of,\nyou know, 50, 100, 200 years of like the basically\nmost aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people, you know, moving to the US and\nraising their kids here. And so we just have, you know, we're by far the\nmost dynamic population, most aggressive. You know, we're the most\naggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country, and have been for a long\ntime, and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the\nadvanced technology leader. You know, we have our\nissues and we have a... I would say particular\nissue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for, you know, anything\nin software, anything in AI, anything in, you know,\nall these, you know, advanced biotech, all these\nadvanced areas of technology, like we're by far the leader. Again, in part 'cause many\nof the best scientists and engineers in those fields, you know, come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for a just a monster boom. You know, I could see\neconomic growth going way up. I could see productivity\ngrowth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a\nglobal tour, if you like, but like, basically, all of our competitors\nhave like profound issues and, you know, we could kind\nof go through them one by one, but the competitive\nlandscape just is, it's like, it's remarkable how much better positioned\nwe are for growth. - What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical questions. You know, I travel across the world and there's something\nabout the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be\nthe Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? - Yeah. So is this a family\nshow or am I allowed to swear? - You could say whatever\nthe fuck you want. - (laughs) Okay. So the great TV show, \"Succession,\" the show, of course, which\nyou were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.\n- Yes. - The best line from \"Succession\"\nwas in the final episode of the first season\nwhen the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral\nhomeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle,\nyou know, for some wedding. And Logan is just like\ncompletely miserable, have to having to, you know, 'cause he is been in\nNew York for 50 years, he's totally miserable\nbeing back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here and go back to America where\nwe can fuck without condoms.\" (both laughing) - Was that a metaphor or... Okay.\n- Exactly. Right. And so no, but it's exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what, like-\n- Yeah. - Everybody watching that\ninstantly starts laughing 'cause you know what it means,\nwhich it's exactly this. I think there's like an\nethnographic, you know, way of it. There's a bunch of\nbooks on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all\nthe different derivations of all the different ethnic\ngroups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. Right, and what we have is\nthis sort of amalgamation of like, you know, the\nNortheast, you know, Yankees who are like super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are\nsuper aggressive, you know, we've got the, you know, the Southerners and the Texans, you know, and you know, the sort of, you\nknow, whole kind of blended, you know, kind of\nAnglo-Hispanic thing, you know, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, you know, capable characters. You know, the Texas Rangers,\nyou know, we've got the, yeah, we've got the California, you\nknow, we've got the, you know, the wild, we've got the\nincredibly, you know, inventive hippies, but we also\nhave the hardcore engineers. We've got, you know, the best, you know, rocket scientists in the world. We've got the best, you\nknow, artists in the world, you know, creative professionals,\nyou know, the best movies. And so yeah, there is, you know, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, you\nknow, in my view to some extent, you know, attempts to\nbasically sand all that off and make everything basically\nboring and mediocre. But there is something\nin the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just\nneed people to stand up at a certain point and say, you know, \"It's time to build, it's time to grow, you know,\nit's time to do things.\" And there's something\nin the American spirit that just like roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I actually saw, you know, I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s, you know, 'cause the '70s were like horribly depressing, right? In the US. Like they were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has\nfelt a lot like the '70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating,\nyou know, negative attitude and everybody's upset about everything. And, you know, and then by\nthe way, like energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization, right? You know, the low point for\nin the '70s was, you know, Jimmy Carter who just passed away. He went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech. And it was like the weakest possible, trying to like rouse people\nback to a sense of like passion, he completely failed. And, you\nknow, we had the, you know, the hostages in, you know,\nIran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly\nnews, it was, you know, lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then, you know, Reagan came in and, you know, Reagan was a\nvery controversial character at the time, and, you know, he came in\nand he is like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're gonna do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and, you know, roared really\nhard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what... I think, you know, we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. - And I just did a super long\npodcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible\nprofessor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic.\n- Yes. - And one of which maybe\nyou can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual\nfreedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just\nin general, individualism. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and as you know this, America has this incredible\nstreak of individualism, you know, individualism in\nAmerica probably peaked, I think between roughly call\nit the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably\ncall it 1931 or something, you know, and there was\nthis like incredible rush. I mean, that period, you know, we now know that period as the\nSecond Industrial Revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then, you know, that led to, you know, ultimately then therefore\nbeing able to, you know, not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II\nand then win the Cold War. And yeah, you know, massive\nindividualistic streak. By the way, you know,\nMilton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring.\n- Yep. - As they were then, you know, he is a singular figure and many of us, you\nknow, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of\npeople who worked with him and you know, he was a singular figure, but all of his lessons, you know, live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's\nnot just individualism, and this is, you know, this\nis one of the big things, it's like playing out\nin a lot of our culture and kind of political fights\nright now, which is, you know, basically this feeling, you\nknow, certainly that I have and I share with a lot\nof people, which is, it's not enough for America\nto just be an economic zone. And it's not enough for\nus to just be individuals, and it's not enough to\njust have line go up, and it's not enough to\njust have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also, you know,\nthere's more to a country than just that. And you know, quite frankly,\na lot of it is intangible. A lot of it is, you know,\ninvolve spirit and passion. And you know, like I said, we have more of it than\nanybody else, but, you know, we have to choose to want it. The way I look at, it's\nlike all of our problems are self-inflicted. Like, you know, decline is a choice. You know, all of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, you know, basically people telling us, people in positions of\nauthority telling us that, you know, \"We shouldn't,\nyou know, stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous,\nwe shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, you know, we shouldn't this,\nthat, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about\neverything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think\npeople are done with it. - If we could go on a\ntangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book \"The Ancient City.\"\n- Yes. - By, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa\nDenis Fustel de Coulanges, I don't know. - That was amazing. - Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said, this is an\nimportant book to understand who we are and where we come from. - So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by\nthis guy as a (indistinct). I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language\npronunciations for the day. He was a professor classics\nat the Sorbonne in Paris, you know, the top university,\nactually in the 1860s, so actually, right around\nafter the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a\nparticular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the\nbook as he had apparently read, and, you know, sort of absorbed and memorized every\npossible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about\nGreek and Roman culture, and that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none\nof that has changed, right? And so he had access to the\nexact same written materials that we have access to, and you know, we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he\ndid is he went back further. He reconstructed the people\nwho came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their\nlife and society was like. And these were the\npeople who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you\nmay have heard of these are the people who came\ndown from the steppes. And so they came out of what's\nnow like Eastern Europe, like around sort of the\noutskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of\nswept through Europe. They ultimately took over\nall of Europe, by the way, you know, almost many of the\nethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years\nthat follow, you know, are Indo-European. And so like, you know, they were this basically this warrior, basically class that like\ncame down and swept through and you know, essentially, you know, populated much of the world. And there's a whole\ninteresting saga there. But what he does, and then they basically, from there came basically\nwhat we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind\nof evolutions off of that. And so what he reconstructs\na sort of what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind\nof original social state. And the significance of that\nis the original social state is this is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no\ntechnology, (laughs) right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got the clothes on your back, you've got your, you know, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you know, predates\nbasically all concepts of technologies as we\nunderstand 'em today. And so these are people\nunder like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social\npatterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern\nbasically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero\nconcept of individual rights and essentially no\nconcept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set\nof tribes would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what\nNietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality,\nanything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it's very clear why that is, right? It's 'cause strong equals\ngood equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is it more important\nfor you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, you know, live as a slave on your\nknees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted\nthat moral framework. But it, you know, the\noriginal framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally\nobligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. (laughs) Right, you were morally required to. Like, if you didn't do\nit, you were a bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time\nwith no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives\nis that it's a collective you know, and people are\nsharing and of course, that limited how big they could get 'cause you know, the\nproblem with communism is it doesn't scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it\nwork at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately\ntied into their religion. And their religion was,\nit was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors\nis extremely important because it was basically the\nancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the\npeople who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of nature 'cause of course, nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city\nhad their ancestor gods, and then they had their nature gods. Okay, so fast-forward to today, like we live in a world that\nis like radically different, and the book takes you\nthrough kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans, through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because\nthe conventional view of the progress through time\nis that we are, you know, the cliche is the arc of the\nmoral universe, you know, bend towards justice, right? Or so-called wig history,\nwhich is, you know, that the arc of progress\nis positive, right? And so, you know, what\nyou hear all the time, what you're taught in school\nand everything is, you know, every year that goes by,\nwe get better and better and more and more moral\nand more and more pure and a better version of ourselves, our Indo-European ancestors would say, \"Oh, no, like you people\nhave like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically your civilization, and you have diluted\nthem down to the point where they barely even matter. You know, and you're having, you know, children outta a wedlock and you're, you know, you\nregularly encounter people of other cities and you\ndon't try to kill them.\" And like, how crazy is that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an\nincredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious,\nhighly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can't resist noting\nthat as a consequence of basically going through\nall the transitions we've been through, going all the way through\nChristianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We're in a secular society,\nyou know, that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but you know, largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved,\nmodern secular, you know, expert, scientists and so\nforth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact\nsame religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had,\nspecifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics\nand nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, worked our way all the way\nback to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show\nthat like, you know, in some ways we have fallen\nfar from the family tree, but in some cases, we're exactly the same. - You kind of described this\nprogressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. - Identity politics is\nworshiping ancestors, right?\n- Yeah. - It's tagging newborn\ninfants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've\nrecognized it on sight. We somehow think it's like\nsuper socially progressive. - Yeah. And it is not. - I mean, I would say obviously not. You know, get nuanced, which\nis where I think you're headed, which is look like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent\nsociety every generation, and have no regard whatsoever\nfor what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea, right? That's like the Cambodians\nwith Year Zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up\neverything that came before and create something new\nin the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing, you know,\nenormous destruction. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, there is like a deeply\nimportant role for tradition. And the way I think\nabout that is the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And you know, this is what\nIndo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled\nwisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and\npowerful lessons learned. And that's why I think\nit's fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is 'cause that's part of the history and you know, part of the learning that got us to where we're today. Having said that, there are\nmany cultures around the world that are, you know, mired\nin tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that's the default human\ncondition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in\nsocieties in which, you know, there's like absolute\nseniority by age, you know, kids are completely... You know, like in the\nUS, like for some reason, we decided kids are in\ncharge of everything, right? And like, you know,\nthey're the trendsetters and they're allowed to\nlike, set all the agendas and like set all the politics\nand set all the culture and maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. 'Cause it's the old\npeople who are in charge of everything, you know,\nthey're gerontocracies, and it's all a bunch of\n80-year-olds running everything, which by the way, we have a\nlittle bit of that too, right? And so what I would say is like, there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is\ncommunitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you\nknow, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, I mean, it just\ndoesn't get you anywhere. Like, it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a society living\nin the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in\nall the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, you know, I think it probably, this is one of those things\nwhere extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. - So the beautiful picture you\npainted of the roaring '20s, how can the Trump\nadministration play a part in making that future happen? - Yeah, so look, a big part of this is getting the government\nboot off the neck of the American economy, the\nAmerican technology industry, the American people. You know, and again, this\nis a replay of what happened in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know, for what started out looking\nlike, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you\nknow, we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I describe as sort of a\nform of soft authoritarianism. You know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's not like, you know, you\nget thrown into Lubyanka. You know, for the most part, it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know,\nincredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vetocracy, right? What's required to get anything done? You know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything,\nany one of them can veto it. You know, there's a lot of (indistinct)\npolitical system works. And then, you know, just this\ngeneral idea of, you know, progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses\nis bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome,\nyou know, basically anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. Anybody who's wrong\nabout anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this\nvery kind of, you know, grinding repression. And then coupled with\nspecific government actions such as censorship regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, you know, critical American industries and then, you know,\ncongratulating yourselves on the back for doing it, or, you know, having these\nhorrible social policies, like let's let all the\ncriminals outta jail and see what happens, right? And so, like we've just\nbeen through this period, you know, I call it a\ndemoralization campaign. Like we've just been through\nthis period where, you know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being\nthis comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible\nand if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration\nreached kinda the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many\nfronts at the same time. And so just like relieving that and getting kind of back\nto a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic,\nconstructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind,\nthere's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is gonna, I think,\ncause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of\nthings proactively that, yeah. And then there's a lot\nof things proactively that could be done. - So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically\npermeated government and permeated big companies? - Disclaimer at first, which is I don't wanna predict\nanything on any of this stuff 'cause I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics\nor Washington at all. But I would just say that\nthe plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration\nand that they plan to take, you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're gonna do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they're gonna do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they're gonna move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. Like, I mean, you know, we just saw a great example\nof this with what, you know, with what Mark Zuckerberg\nis doing, you know, and obviously I'm\ninvolved with his company, but you know, we just saw it\nkind of in public, the scope, and speed of the changes, you know, are reflective of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry, right? And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump\nor anti-Trump, like, there's just like a giant vibe shift mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a\ngroup of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still, you know, people who at least vocally\nwere still very anti-Trump, but I said, you know, \"Has anything changed since November 6th?\" And they immediately said, \"Oh, it's completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. You know, woke is over.\" You know, they said that\nall kinds of projects are gonna be able to get\nmade now they couldn't before that, you know, Hollywood's gonna start\nmaking comedies again. You know, like, they were just, just like an incredible\nimmediate environmental change. And as I talk to people kind\nof throughout, you know, certainly throughout the economy,\npeople who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which\nis just this last 10 years of misery is just over. I mean, the one that I'm\nwatching that's really funny. I mean, Facebook's getting a lot, Meta's getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is\nBlackRock, which I'm not, you know, and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so, you know, the Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock was like first in as a major, you know, investment CEO on like\nevery dumb social trend and rule set, like every... All right, I'm going for it.\nEvery retardant, (laughs) every retarded thing you can imagine.\n- Yeah. - Every ESG and every, like, every possible saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed\nideological positions. And, you know, he was coming\nin, he literally was like, had a aggregated together\ntrillions of dollars of shareholdings that he did not, you know, that were his customer's rights. And he, you know, seized\ntheir voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been like backpedaling\nfrom that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example, last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, you know, he pulled out\nof the crazy energy stuff. And so, like, you know, he's\nbacking away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard\nPryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where\nhe could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (Lex laughing) (laughs) And so, you know,\neven there doing that, and just the whole thing, I mean this, I dunno if you saw the court\nrecently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of\ndirectors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel\nand I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional\nattorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight\nface that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who\nliterally wrote a book called \"The Diversity Myth.\"\n- Yeah. - And he literally looked\nlike he'd swallowed a live goldfish and that-\n- Yeah. - And this was imposed, I mean, this was like so\nincredibly offensive to him that like, it was just\nabsolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (Lex laughing) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange\nimposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that, you know, so like these things basically are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other\nside of it is basically, you know, finally being able\nto get back to, you know, everything that, you know,\neverybody always wanted to do, which is like, run their\ncompanies, have great products, have happy customers,\nyou know, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society. - It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. - Well, so it was very, you\nknow, there was a moment. So you know, Peter, of course, you know, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but you know, there are other\nmen on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it,\nand we're like, all right, like, okay, LGBT, and we keep\ncoming back to the B, right? And it's like- (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - You know, it's like-\n- All right. - You know, I'm willing to do\na lot for this company, but- (both laughing) - It's all about sacrifice for diversity. - Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay,\nlike is there a test? - Right.\n- Right. You know, so.\n(Lex laughing) - Oh, yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? - [Marc] The questions\nthat got asked, you know. - What are you willing to do-\n- Yeah, and- - The greater good? - I've become very good at asking lawyers\ncompletely absurd questions with a totally straight face. - And do they answer with a\nstraight face, like lawyers- - Sometimes.\n- Okay. - I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. - So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon\nValley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to\npreference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? Like what percent of them\nare feeling this vibe shift and are interested in\ncreating the roaring '20s in the way they've described? - So first, we should\nmaybe talk population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley and the way to just measure that is just look at\nvoting records, right? And what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically, my entire time there has\nbeen overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that\nis political donation records. And again, you know,\nthe political donations in the Valley, you know,\nrange from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. And so, you know, I just\nbring it up 'cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there\nis a very big question of what's happening in\nLos Angeles right now. I don't wanna get into the fire, but like, it's catastrophic. And, you know, there was\nalready a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people\nin LA are really thinking about things right now as\nthey're trying to, you know, literally save their houses\nand save their families. But, you know, even in San Francisco, you know, there was a big shift\nto the right in the voting in '24. So, we'll see where\nthat goes, but you know, you observe that by just looking\nat the numbers over time. The part that I'm more\nfocused on is, you know, and I don't know how to\nexactly describe this, but it's like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people, right? You know, and I don't have a list, but like, you know, it's\nall the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top\nengineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, you know, the people who kind of\nbuilt and run the companies. And they're, you know,\nI don't have numbers, but I have a much more\ntactile feel, you know, for what's happening. So the big thing I have\nnow come to believe is that the idea that people\nhave beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most\nhigh-status people just go along. And I think maybe the\nmost high-status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the\nmost focused on status. And the way I would\ndescribe that is, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the\nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely\ninteresting articulation. You know, he was an\ninsane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. (both laughing) But-\n- Shots fired, man. - But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing\nwhere he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that's just stuck in my\nmind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept, you just called over-socialization. And so, you know, most\npeople are socialized, like most people are, you\nknow, we live in a society, most people learn how\nto be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There's something about\nmodern Western elites where they're over-socialized and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, you know, think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little\nbit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence\nof where I grew up. Like even before I had the\nviews that I have today, there was always just this\nweird thing where it's like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree\non every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in The New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? (laughs) Right? But why does everybody like\nsnap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I\ncame to Silicon Valley, and it's just as true\ntoday 30 years later. And so I think most\npeople are just literally, I think they're taking their cues from, it's some combination of\nthe press, the universities, the big foundations. So basically, it's like\nThe New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and you know, I don't\nknow, you know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and you know, maybe the President if\nyour party is in power. And like, whatever that is, everybody who's sort of\ngood and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the\ntwo interesting things about that is, number one, there's no divergence among\nthe organs of power, right? So Harvard and Yale believed\nthe exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believed the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and\nthe Rockefeller Foundation believed the exact same thing. Google, and, you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believed the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there's never conflict\nin the moment, right? And so, you know, The New York Times and The Washington Post\nagreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the\nspecifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically, we in the valley, we're\non the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood's\non the tail end of that, in the same way New York's\non the tail end of that, the same way the media's\non the tail end of that. It's like some sort of\ncollective hive mind thing. And I just go through that to say like, I don't think most people in my orbit, or you know, let's say the top\n10,000 people in the Valley, or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're sitting\nthere thinking basically, I have rocks... I mean, they probably think\nthey have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core\nof rocks solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch\nreality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they\nconform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time, they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd. - Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that, there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking to\npeople really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens\nat the dinner parties? Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four\npeople who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the\nmind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention\nwithin New York Times with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that\novertook Marc Andreessen's face. - So look, I'll just\ntell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences,\nno, there's none of that. What there is that all of the\nheretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation is either\ndiscussed a one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real-life social network. There's a secret handshake,\nwhich is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like\nknow each other a little bit, but like not well. And like you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to\nthe other person openly or whether you have to\nlike be fully conformist. It's a joke. - Well, yeah, humor- - [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke.\n- Yep. - If the other person laughs,\nthe conversation is on. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - If the other person doesn't laugh, back slowly away from the scene, (laughs) I didn't mean anything by it. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then by the way, it\ndoesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke\nthat's just up against the edge of one of the, use the\nSam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. You know, it has to be up\nagainst one of the things, you know, one of the things\nthat you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point,\nwhat happens is you have a peer-to-peer network, right? You have a one-to-one\nconnection with somebody, and then you have your own, your little conspiracy\nof a thought criminality, and then you've probably\nbeen through this, you have your network\nof thought criminals, and then they have their\nnetwork of thought criminals, and then you have this\nlike delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together, right? - And the fundamental mechanism\nof the dance is humor. - Yeah, it's humor like it, right? Well, of course.\n- Memes. Yeah. - Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor's a way\nto have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss\nserious thing without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right? So that's part of it, which is one of the reasons\nwhy comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can't. 'Cause, you know, they\ncan always fall back on, oh, yeah, I was just going for the laugh.\n- Yeah. - But the other key\nthing about humor, right? Is that laughter's involuntary, right? Like, you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision whether you're gonna laugh. And everybody can tell when\nsomebody's fake laughing, right? And this, every professional\ncomedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something truthful. Like, people don't laugh at\nlike, made-up bullshit stories. They laugh 'cause like\nyou're revealing something that they either have not\nbeen allowed to think about or have not been allowed\nto talk about, right? Or is off limits. And all of a sudden,\nit's like the ice breaks and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny and like I laugh, and then, of course,\nthis is why, of course, live comedy is so powerful is 'cause you're all doing\nthat at the same time, so you start to have, you\nknow, the safety of numbers. And so the comedians have like the all, it's no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has\nbeen as successful as he has 'cause they have this\nhack that the, you know, the rest of us who are\nnot professional comedians don't have, but you have\nyour in-person version of it. Yeah, and then you've got the question of whether you can sort of\njoin the networks together. And then you've probably\nbeen to this is, you know, then at some point\nthere's like a different, there's like the alt dinner party, the (indistinct) dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are like the happiest\nmoments of everybody's lives, 'cause they're just like,\neverybody's just ecstatic, 'cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed, like for every third sentence that comes outta my mouth, and we can actually\ntalk about real things. So that's the live version of it. And then, of course, the other\nside of it's the, you know, the group chat phenomenon, right? And then basically the same\nthing played out, you know, until Elon bought X and until\nSubstack took off, you know, which were really the\ntwo big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute\nconformity on the social networks, like literally enforced by\nthe social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through\ncancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming, right? But then group chats grew\nup to be the equivalent of samizdat, right? Anybody who grew up in the\nSoviet Union under, you know, communism, note, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It is like, how do you\nknow who you could talk to? And then how do you\ndistribute information? And like, you know, again, that was the hard\nauthoritarian version of this. And then we've been living\nthrough this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, with\nsome of the same patterns. - And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient\nto build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. - Yeah, exactly. Well,\nand this is the thing, and well, this is kind of the running joke about groups, right? The running kind of\nthing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, every group chat, if you've noticed this like, this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up\nbeing about memes and humor. And the game of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable. - [Lex] Yeah. - As you can get without\nactually tripping it, right? And like literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest\nwhere, but it's walking, they walk right up the line\nand they're constantly testing. And every once in a while\nsomebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, \"Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, we gotta wait until\nnext year to talk about that.\" You know, they walk it back. And so it's that same thing, and yeah. And then group chats is a\ntechnological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. 'Cause basically, it was number one, it was, you know, obviously\nthe rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of\nthe new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination\nof WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is\nthose were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough, I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably\nfour or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages,\nI think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of the\ndisappearing messages, right? And so it's like, you know, I\noften get behind on my thing, so I set to seven-day, you\nknow, disappearing messages and my friends who, you know, are like, no, that's way too much risk. - Yeah.\n- It's gotta be a day. And then every once in a\nwhile somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something\nlike particularly inflammatory. - Yeah, 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that\nbothers me about WhatsApp, the choices between 24 hours\nand, you know, seven days, one day or seven days.\n- (laughs) Right. - And I have to have an existential crisis about deciding.\n- Yes. - Whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Now, of course,\nwhat's happening right now is the big thaw, right? And so the vibe shift. So what's happening on the\nother side of the election is, you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the\ncontinued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new\nplatforms that are emerging. You know, like I think\nit may be, you know, I don't know that everything\njust shifts back into public, but like a tremendous amount\nof the verboten conversations, you know, can now shifts\nback into public view. And I mean, quite frankly,\nthis is one of those things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those, you know, what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like\nnet better for society that those things happen in\npublic instead of private. You know, do you really want, like, yeah. Like does she wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it's just, look, it's just I think,\nclearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. - I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea\nthat we're talking about. I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction\nof people have that? To me, the preference falsification\nis really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? 'Cause like that the dynamical system that is the difference between\nthose two is fascinating. Like, throughout history, the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting, 'cause everybody was following, you know, the line until not.\n- Right. - But for sure, privately,\nthere was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where like this is the\nbureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really\nbothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden, there's a trigger that allows\nthe vibe shift to happen. To me, like the interesting\nquestion here is, what is the landscape of\nprivate thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how\nmuch dormant energy is there for this roaring '20s? What people are like, no more\nbullshit, let's get shit done. - Yeah, so we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- - [Lex] Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly, this is one\nof the all-time great books. Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book, but it's completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply\nhistorically informed. So it's called \"Private\nTruths, Public Lies.\" And it's written by a social science\nprofessor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his\na definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls preference falsification. And so preference\nfalsification is two things, preference falsification... And you get it from the title of the book, \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So preference falsification\nis when you believe something and you can't say it, or/and this is very important,\nyou don't believe something and you must say it, right? And the commonality there is\nin both cases, you're lying. You believe something internally, and then you're lying about it in public. And so the thing, you know, and there's sort of the\ntwo classic forms of it. There's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe\ncommunism is rotten, but I can't say it version of it. But then there's also the famous parable of the real-life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good\nbook on this topic, which is \"The Power of the Powerless,\" you know, who is an\nanti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the, you know, the president Czechoslovakia\nafter the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book, and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of\nthe world unite, right? And so he describes what he calls the parable of the greengrocer, which is your greengrocer\nin Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been... 50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your story that says, \"Workers of\nthe world, unite,\" right? And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear\nthat the workers of the world are not going to unite. (laughs) Like of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been\nat that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be\nin your window every morning, because if it's not in\nyour window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are gonna come by and they're gonna get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays\nin the window all day long. But he says, the thing\nis, every single person, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the slogan knows that it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the store knows that the greengrocer is\nonly putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to\ngo through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the\nsystem and lying in public. And so it turns into\ndemoralization campaign. In fact, it's not ideological\nenforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake, everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're\nenforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they are\nenforcing compliance, right? And compliance with the regime. And fuck you, you will comply, right? And so anyway, that's\nthe other side of that. And of course, we have\nlived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening\nto this could name a series of slogans that\nwe've all been forced to chant for the last decade, that everybody knows at\nthis point are just like, simply not true. I'll let the audience, you know, speculate on their own group chats. (both laughing) - Send Marc your memes\nonline as well, please. - Yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so anyway, so it's the\ntwo sides of that, right? So it's \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending\nthat from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire\nsociety experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages\nquestion, which is like, okay, what happens in a society\nin which people are forced to lie in public about\nwhat they truly believe? What happens number one\nis that individually they're lying in public, and that's bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have\nan accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how\nmany people agree with them. And this is how you, and\nagain, this literally is like how you get something\nlike the communist system, which is like, okay, you\nend up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be\nwilling to go along with it, but I'm not gonna be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the people who agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a\nmovement, you're gonna get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're gonna win the revolution, right? And so the question of like\nwhat the percentage actually is like a really critical question. And then, basically, in any\nsort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know\nuntil you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put at\nthe test in the same way. This is exactly what's happened\nfor the last two years, like 100% of exactly what's happened. It's like straight outta this book, which is somebody, Elon,\nsticks his hand up (laughs) and says, \"The workers of the\nworld are not going to unite.\" - Yeah.\n- Right. Or the emperor is actually\nwearing no clothes, right? You know that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is\nstanding there by themselves, and everybody else in\nthe audience is like, \"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna\nhappen to that guy,\" right? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn't know, the\nfirst guy doesn't know, other people don't know, like,\nwhich way is this gonna go? And it may be that's a minority position and that's the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that's a majority position and you are now the\nleader of a revolution. And then basically, of\ncourse, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that\ndoesn't get killed, (laughs) the second guy does... Well, a lot of the time\nthat guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn't get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing, all right? Now, you've got two. Two leads to four, four leads\nto eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia\nand Eastern Europe in '89, when it goes, it can go, right? And then it rips. And then what happens\nis very, very quickly, if it turns out that you\nhad a large percentage of the population that actually believed\nthe different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, \"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority.\" And at that point, like you\nwere on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. Right, now. The other part of this is the distinction between the role of the\nelites and the masses. And here the best book is called \"The True Believer,\" which\nis the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this 'cause the elites do idea\nformation and communication. But the elites, by definition\nare a small minority. And so there's also this giant\nrole played by the masses, and the masses are not\nnecessarily thinking these things through in the same\nintellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure\nexperiencing these things in their daily lives,\nand they for sure have at least very strong\nemotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the\nelites lined up with, or either the current elites change or a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually\na different better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the, you know, to\nfollow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is\nalso happening right now. And again, case study\none of that would be Elon and you know, who turns out, you know, in truly massive following. - And he has done that over and over in different industries, not\njust saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit\nin the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. - Yeah. And it's like, well,\nbut then there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, and this is where, you know, there are many specific\nthings about Elon's genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit,\nbut in his mind it's true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else. He's not right all the time. But at least my through\nline with him both in what he says in public and\nwhat he says in private, which by the way are\nthe exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about\nwhat he believes in private, or at least he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's 100% consistent\nin my experience. By the way, there's two guys who are 100% consistent like that I know. Elon and Trump. (both laughing) - Yeah.\n- Whatever you think of them. - [Lex] Yeah. - What they say in\nprivate is 100% identical to what they say in public. Like, they're completely transparent, they're completely honest\nin that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful\nleaders of these movements, 'cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost\neveryone else actually believes, but nobody was actually\nwilling to say out loud. And so they can actually\ncatalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this\nframework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party, as I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind\nof conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one\nwho was saying them. And so the again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes, like we're\ngoing this other direction. That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual\nmechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me\nthat we have been living through exactly this. We've been living through\neverything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav\nHavel described, (laughs) you know, Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've been living\nthrough the, you know, the true believer elites\nmasses, you know, thing with, you know, with a set of like\nbasically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the loyalty masses anymore, and a set of new elites that\nare running away with things. And so like, we're living through this like\nincredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a\nmoral of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really\nbad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they\nhave to do, you know, to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. - So one of the ways to avoid\nthat in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between\nwhat's said in private and what's said in public small. - Yeah. It's like, well, this\nis sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep\npeople from saying things, which means we can keep\npeople from thinking things. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know, by the way, that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean,\nagain, the hard form, you know, Soviet Union\nowning a mimeograph, pre-photocopiers, there\nwere mimeograph machines that were used to make samizdat\nand underground newspapers, which is the mechanism\nof written communication of radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death, right? So that's the hard version, right? You know, the soft version\nis somebody clicks a button in Washington and you are\nerased from the internet, right? Like, which, you know, good\nnews, you're still alive. Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your\nfamily now, you know, they hates you and won't\ntalk to you, but you know, you know, whatever the version\nof cancellation has been. And so like, does that work? Like maybe it works for a while, like it worked for the\nSoviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially\nwhen it was coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like\nincredible speed and ferocity. 'Cause to your point, there's\nall this bottled up energy. Now, your question was like,\nwhat are the percentages? Like what's the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. It's like you've got 20%, like true believers in\nwhatever is, you know, the current thing, you know, you got 20% of people who are just like\ntrue believers of whatever they, you know, whatever's\nin the new, like I say, whatever's in The New York\nTimes, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation,\nlike they're just believe. And by the way, maybe\nit's 10, maybe it's five, but let's say generously it's 20. So you know, 20% kind of\nfull-on revolutionaries. And then you've got, let's\ncall it 20% on the other side that are like, \"No, I'm\nnot on board with this. This is crazy. I'm not signing up for this.\" But, you know, they view themselves as they're in a small minority, and in fact, they start\nout in a small minority, 'cause what happens is the\n60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people. And it's not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying\nto go to work each day and do a good job and be a good\nperson and raise their kids and, you know, have a little\nbit of time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, political activism or any of this stuff. It's just not their thing. But that's where the over\nsocialization comes in, it's just like, okay, by\ndefault, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the\nradical revolutionaries, at least for a while. And then the counter elite\nis in this other 20%. And over time, they build\nup a theory and network and ability to resist and a\nnew set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's\na contest and then, right? And then the question is,\nwhat happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kinda my point, it's not even really does\nthe 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like,\nokay, what is the thing that 60% now decides to\nbasically fall into step with? And I think that, in the valley, that 60% for the last\ndecade decided to be woke and, you know, extremely, I would say, (laughs) on\nedge on a lot of things. And you know, that 60%\nis pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it. - And I would love to\nsee where that pivot goes 'cause there's internal battles\nhappening right now, right? - So this is the other thing, okay, so there's two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is, he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you're gonna have\nis you're now gonna have people in the other direction. You're\ngonna have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't, (laughs) right?\n- Right. - So it's gonna swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's\nnot the only part of this, but you know, he's just a\nconvenient shorthand for, you know, for a lot of this. But, you know, whatever it is, you'll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, right? Or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled\nthat person, right? Where of course, they were\nfull on a part of the mob, like, you know, kind of at\nthat moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference\nfalsification happening in the other direction. And his prediction, I think,\nbasically is you'll end up with the same quote,\n\"problem\" on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. You know, how far is American\nsociety willing to go on any of these things? I don't know. But like, there is some question there. And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this, you\nknow, elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those\npeople are still in power and they're in very, you\nknow, important positions. And The New York Times is\nstill The New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard. And like, those people haven't\nchanged like at all, right? And bureaucrats in the governments and, you know, senior democratic, you know, politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there, you know, right now feeling like reality\nhas just smacked them hard in the face 'cause they\nlost the election so badly. But they're now going into a, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War, right? And that form of the Civil\nWar is completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize\n'cause we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half\nof them are saying, \"No, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak, we were too soft. You know, we must become\nmore revolutionary. We must double down and we\nmust, you know, celebrate, you know, murders in the street of health insurance executives.\" And that right now is like a real fight. - If I could tell you\na little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a\nhistorian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking\nabout having a podcast, on doing a podcast. And he eventually said that,\n\"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I\njust don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are\nthe particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would\nsurprise a lot of people if I said who it is. You know, this is a\nperson who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80-plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Okay? Nevertheless, he just\ndoesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just\nhave a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk\nto your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are\nfeeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts,\nhow quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you\nmentioned 20, 60, 20 matters and the contents of the\nprivate groups matters, and the dynamics of how\nthat shifts matters. 'Cause it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. There's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these\nnew vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold. - Yeah. So he's a friend of yours, I respect that you don't wanna name him. I also respect you\ndon't wanna beat on him, so I would like to beat\non him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? - Yes. He should use it. - So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate\nindictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart\nof our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it's, by the way, it's\nlike across the board, it's like all the top universities. It's like, 'cause the\nsiren song for right? What it's been for 70 years,\nwhatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure\nsystem, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an\nacademic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what\nyou actually think, right? Then you can do your\nwork and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these\npeople have done to it. Like it's gone, like that entire thing was\nfake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely, completely giving up the\nentire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually\n100% by taxpayer money. - What's the inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this,\nwhat can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? - That the population at large is gonna realize the\ncorruption in their industry and it's going to withdraw the funding? - (laughs) It's okay. So desperation. (laughs)\n- No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next.\nOkay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources\nof federal funding. The big one is a federal\nstudent loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of\ndollars at this point. And then only spiraling, you know, way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know\nthat when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as\nmuch as 70% of the money for central uses. - [Lex] Yeah. - Number three is tax exemption\nat the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit\ninstitutions as opposed to, let's say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close\nto a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources\nof federal taxpayer money, and then for the state\nschools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild, 'cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at University of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed\nand I'm cheering for them, but the problem is, you're now inserting. Suppose you and I wanna\nstart a new university and we wanna hire all the\nfree thinking professors, and we wanna have the\nplace that fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. I'll give you the most direct reason, we can't get access to that money, we can't get access to\nfederal student funding. Do you know how\nuniversities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They're not accredited by\nthe Department of Education. Instead, what happens is, the Department of Education\naccredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that\ndo the accreditation. Guess what the composition of\nthe accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to\nfederal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic\nthey are about accrediting a new university? Right, and so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone... I mean, it's just obvious now. It's just gone like sideways in basically any possible\nway it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting beaten\nup on campus for being, you know, the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every\npossible way at this point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these\nthings without replacing them. And there's no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's\nlike everything in life. I mean, in a sense, this is\nlike the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when\na company does a bad job, is they go bankrupt and another company\ntakes its place, right? And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that\nis what happens is this is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? 'Cause things are tested and tried, and then you, you know, the things that are good survive. And so these places\nhave cut themselves off. They've been allowed to cut\nthemselves off from both, from evolution at the institutional level and evolution of the\nindividual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable\nin their current form. - I disagree with you on that. Maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can\nrevolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford\nand MIT are important. - Oh, but that logic\ndoesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. - Underpants gnome, can you\nexplain what that means? - Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started\nwatching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is \"South Park.\" - Yes.\n- And there is- - Wow. - And there is a, which by the way is a little\naggressive for a nine-year-old. - Very aggressive. - But he likes it. So he's learning all kinds of new words. - And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. - I told him, I said, \"You're\ngonna hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\" - Right. (laughs) Education. - And I said, \"You know\nhow we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I said, \"Not using a word that you learn in here\ndoes not count as lying.\" - [Lex] Wow.\n- \"And keep that in mind.\" - This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. - And of course, in the\nvery opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls\nthe other kid a dildo. Right, we're off to the races. - Yep. Let's go. - \"Daddy, what's a dildo?\" - [Lex] Yep. (both laughing) - So, you know, \"Sorry son, I don't know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So the-\n- Underpants gnome. - So famous episode of \"South\nPark,\" the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat... All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing the underpants. And it's just like, well,\nwho on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it's\nthe underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants\ngnomes that come to town and they've got this\nlittle underground warrant of tunnels in storage places\nfor all the underpants. And so they go out at night,\nthey steal the underpants, and the kids discover that, you\nknow, the underpants gnomes, and they're, you know,\n\"What are you doing? Like what's the point of this?\" And so the underpants gnomes\npresent their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit.\n- Yeah. - [Marc] Step two, question mark. (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So you just proposed the underpants gnome-\n- Yeah. - Which is very common in politics. Oh, so the form of this in politics is we must do something.\n- Yeah. - This is something,\ntherefore we must do this. But there's no causal logic chain in there at all to expect\nthat's actually gonna succeed 'cause there's no reason to believe that it is.\n- Yeah, but- - And it's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the\nhost of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I hear this, I have friends\nwho are on these boards, right?\n- Yeah. - Very involved in these places, and I hear this all the\ntime, which is like, \"Oh, these are very important. We must fix them.\" And so therefore, they're fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. - If there's that pressure\nthat you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty primary, fire a lot of the administration and realign and reinvigorate\nthis idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't... Because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is\naligned with this very idea that you're talking about. It's this meaning like\nintellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface it's aligned, underneath it's become corrupted. - If we say free speech and\nacademic freedom, often enough, sooner or later, these tenured\nprofessors will get brave. - Wait, do you think the universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions\nfor educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit\nthat's outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create\ninstitution like that? - How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? - Right. You invent something new? - You open a new restaurant. - Yeah. - Like how often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that's just absolutely horrible, and it's poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you\ngo back and it's fantastic? Charlie Munger actually\nhad the best comment on, this great investor, Charlie Munger, has great comment. He was once asked, he's like,\nyou know, his, you know, General Electric was going\nthrough all these challenges and he was asked to do Q&A. It said, \"How would you fix the culture at General Electric?\" And he said, \"Fix the\nculture at General Electric?\" He said, \"I couldn't even fix\nthe culture at a restaurant.\" (Lex laughing) Like, it's insane. Like obviously you can't do it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nobody in business\nthinks you can do that. Like, it's impossible. Like it's not, now look, having said all that, I\nshould also express this 'cause I have a lot of friends\nwho work at these places and are involved in various\nattempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong, I\nwould love to be wrong. I would love for the\nunderpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how\nto do. I would love to fix it, I'd love to see them come back\nto their spoken principles, I think that'd be great. I'd love to see the professors\nwith tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I\nmean, it would be fantastic. You know, my partner and I have done like a lot of\npublic speaking on this topic, it's been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay,\nlike these challenges have to be confronted directly. By the way, let me also\nsay something positive. You know, especially post-October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart\npeople who are major donors and board members of these\ninstitutions like Marc Rowan, you know, who are really\ncoming in trying to, you know, I think legitimately\ntrying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He's working overtime to try to do this. Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question\nwould just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? - I'm a person that\nbelieves in leadership. If you have the right leadership- - [Marc] Right. - The whole system can be changed. - So here's a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? - You know how I think runs it? - [Marc] Yeah. - Whoever the fuck says they run it, that's what great leadership is. Like a president has that power.\n- But how does- - President of university has the leverage 'cause they can mouth off like Elon can. - Can they fire the professors? - They can fire them through\nbeing vocal publicly, yes. - Can they fire the professors? - What are you talking about legally? - [Marc] Can they fire- - No, they cannot fire the professors. - Then we know who runs the university. - The professors? - Yeah, professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they're, of course, in a radicalization\nfeedback cycle driving- - You said feral students?\n- The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows\nis that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them\nbecause they cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same\nthing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They cannot outlast you. I mean it's the whole thing\nthat, it's the resistance. Like they can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. - That's definitely a crisis\nthat needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that\nI'm defending academia here. I agree with you that\nthe situation is dire but I just think that\ninstitutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been\ngrilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation\nyou said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's- - I didn't say Dairy Queen\nis a great restaurant. - Let the listener take- - I said Dairy Queen\nis the best restaurant. - The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc\nAndreessen is saying today- - I don't wanna-\n- Put that into cont- - You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard.\n- Yeah. - They can get like\n4,000 calories in a cup. - They can and they're delicious. - [Marc] It's amazing. - They're truly delicious-\n- They're really fantastic. And they'll put anything in there you want.\n- All right- - Okay, so, but anyway, lemme just close by saying, look, my friends at the university\nsystem, I would just say, \"Look like, this is the challenge.\" Like I would just pose\nthis as the challenge. Like to me, like this is, having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation\nthat actually has to happen. This is the bar that\nactually has to be hit. These problems need to\nbe confronted directly, 'cause I think there's been way too much, I mean, I'm actually worried\nkinda on the other side, there's too much happy talk\nin these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers\ncome to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is\ngoing through, you know, no fault of any of ours,\nbut like the fuse is going and there's some window of time here to fix this and address\nit and justify the money 'cause it just, normal taxpayers sitting in\nnormal towns in normal jobs are not gonna tolerate\nthis for that much longer. - You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep\ninto the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to\nspeak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were\nthere when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of\ncensorship on social media. So take me to, through\nthat history, if you can, the use of censorship. - So I was there on the\nground floor in 1993. (both laughing) - There's multiple floors to\nthis building, apparently. - There are.\n- (laughs) Yeah. - So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. - That is fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. Actually, 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. - Did you have the courage to\nspeak up back then? (laughs) - I did not have any problems\nspeaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, you know, I\nwas legitimate, you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research\nproject actually funded by the federal government\nat a public university. So, you know, I don't\nthink my boss was like in any way outta line,\nbut it was like, yeah, like this web browser thing is great, but like could it just make\nsure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for\na second, as a technologist, I had a issue, which is this\nwas like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm (laughs) that I was going to have to design. And then apparently a variety of other, apparently body parts people are also sensitive about.\n- Yeah. - And then I politely declined to do this. - For just the technical\ndifficulties of it. - Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm a, you know,\nI'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days the internet\ngenerally was, you know, a free-fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting\nas sort of pre-'93, the internet was such a\nspecific niche community. Like, it was like the million\nkind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually like\ndidn't really have a lot of, you know, issues that people\nwere like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn't\nwanna start the process. So I think the way to think\nabout this, so first of all, you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I've been involved with\nthis at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007, so I've seen everything\nin the last, you know, almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I've been involved in most of the other companies over time, so I was an angel investor in Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover\nof Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we\nwere the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk\nspecifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you\nlike the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah, so basically the\nway to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that\ncan have zero censorship. And by the way, that also\nmirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited\nfree speech either. The US First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from\nthe Supreme Court over time. You know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're not\ncovered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are gonna\nstart an internet company and have a service, we can't\nhave that stuff either, right? 'Cause it's illegal or\nit will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always gonna\nhave a censorship engine. I mean, hopefully, it's not\nactually in the browser, but like you're gonna have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now\nyou have a machine right now. Now you have a system where\nyou can put in rules saying, we allow this, we don't allow that. You have enforcement, you\nhave consequences, right? And once that system is in place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now\nanybody in that company or anybody associated with that company, or anybody who wants to\npressure that company will just start to say, \"Okay,\nyou should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\" And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like\nvery, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided\nwith the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. You know, it's the kids that\nwere in school between like, you know, for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and like, they came out\nlike super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started\nmounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that\nthese companies were, you know, very subject to being controlled and the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors\nwere almost all Democrats and, you know, there's\ntremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from\nthe first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people\nand other, you know, law enforcement\nintelligence people came in and worked, and you know, they were all Democrats for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they, you know, picked it up and put it\non, and then they just ran. And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech\nconversation started exactly like you'd expect, which is,\nwe can't have the N-word. And which the answer is fair enough, let's not have the N-word. Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right? And Jordan Peterson has\ntalked a lot about this. The definition of hate\nspeech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, right? So we can't have things that make, you know, people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like me that are\ndisagreeable raise their hands and say, \"Well, that idea right there\nmakes me uncomfortable.\" But of course, that doesn't\ncount as hate speech, right? So, you know, the ring\nof power is on one hand and not on the other hand. And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently like\ncompletely anodyne comments that are completely\nlegitimate on television or on the Senate floor all\nof a sudden our hate speech can't be said online. So that, you know, the\nring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the\nstuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little\nbit of that early on, but of course, that really\nkicked in with Trump. So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by like three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence\nof the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you\nknow, a ring of power that was even more powerful, right? Because, you know, hate\nspeech, it's like, okay, at some point, if\nsomething offensive or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with\nmisinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, what do we know for 800 years or whatever Western civilization, it's that, you know,\nthere's only a few entities that can determine the\ntruth on every topic. You know, there's God, you\nknow, there's the king. We don't have those anymore and the rest of us are\nall imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any\ngroup of experts is gonna sit around the table and decide\non the truth is, you know, deeply anti-Western and\ndeeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation\nkind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax\ninto just full-blown, we're gonna use that weapon\nfor whatever we want. And then of course, then the\nculminating moment on that, that really was the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was we're gonna censor all theories that the COVID virus might\nhave been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies\nlike that was the point where people for the first\ntime, this is like what, three years ago for the\nfirst time they were like, and that was when it sunk in\nwhere it's just like, okay, this has spun completely outta control. But anyway, that's how\nwe got to where we are. And then basically that spell lasted that complex existed and\ngot expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and so when I am super\nproud of those guys, 'cause they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were gonna be\na free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And, you know, they\ntried to just beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by\nthe way, from, you know, let's say certain of the\nplatform companies, you know, basically threatening them.\nAnd they stood up to it. And, you know, sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum\nof speech and conversation, you know, anywhere on planet Earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way, it's great. And then obviously Elon, you\nknow, with X was the, you know, the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. - And there's also like singular moments, I think you've spoken about\nthis, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. - [Marc] Yes. - There's certain moments that just kinda shake\neverybody up, the right person, the right time, just it's a wake-up call. - So that there, and\nI will tell you, like, and I should say Jon Stewart\nattacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him, but I would say, I would say\nlong run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of \"The Daily Show\" when he was on it, you know, for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance\non the Colbert Show. And I don't know how\nbroadly this is, you know, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don't know how,\nif people remember this, but I will tell you in the\nrooms where people discuss what his misinformation and these policies, that\nwas a very big moment. That was probably actually\nthe key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I\nwould say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who\ndon't recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, like, you know, you absolutely\nmust lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep\nall the schools closed. You absolutely must have\neverybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a\nmask like the whole thing. And then one of those was,\nyou absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you're a fascist\nNazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person, right? And that was like uniform\nand that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don't know if\nthey planned it or not, 'cause Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much of it was a bit, but he went on there and\nhe just had one of these, like the Emperor's wearing no\nclosed things where he said, \"It's just not plausible that you had the COVID\nsuper virus appear 300 yards down the street from the\nWuhan Institute (laughs) of lethal coronaviruses.\" Like, it's just not plausible that certainly that you\ncould just rule that out. And then there was another\nkey moment, actually, the more serious version\nwas I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big\npiece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is like\none of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been like\nalt, you know, renegade, there had been, you know, people\nrunning around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was\nlike in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember let's say a board meeting at one of these companies after that, where basically, you know, everybody looked around\nthe table and was like, \"All right, like, I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore.\" And, you know, and then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \"Well, wait a minute, why were we censoring\nthat in the first place?\" And okay, like, and then, you know, the\ndownstream, not that day, but the downstream\nconversations were like, \"Okay, if we made such\na giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective\nmistake censoring that, then what does that say about\nthe rest of our regime?\" And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. - I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made\nwas a courageous act. - [Marc] Yeah, I agree. - I think we need to have\nmore of that in the world. And like you said, Elon,\neverything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg\ndid on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? - He has become, I think, an outstanding\ncommunicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for\na lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he's, you know,\nhe's one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And you know, as you do\nwith all of your episodes, like when somebody sit\nand talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody 'cause it's really hard to\nbe artificial for that long. And, you know, he's now\ndone that repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then, look, again, I would maybe put him in\nthe third category now with, certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put\nhim up there now with, you know, kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that. Like he said on that show\nwhat he really believes, he said all the same things\nthat he says in private. Like, I don't think there's\nreally any discrepancy anymore. I would say he has\nalways taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running\na company the size of Meta and to running services\nthat are that large. And I think, you know, his\nconception of what he's doing, which I think is correct,\nis he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. And then, you know, the\ncompany has, you know, many tens of thousands of\nemployees and many investors, and it's a public company,\nand he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so, you know, he has\nnot felt like he has had, let's just say, the complete\nflexibility that Elon has had. And, you know, people could\nargue that one way or the other, but, you know, he talked about a lot. He's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm gonna put\nmyself right back up there. Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this.\nLike, I've also learned a lot. Like, my views on things\nare very different than they were 10 years\nago on lots of topics. And so, you know, I've\nbeen on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as, or better\nthan anybody else I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show\nabout something very important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a set of decisions\nthat you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and\nso forth and it's valid, but you are under tremendous\nexternal pressure as well. And by the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've got your executives\nin some cases coming at you. You've got your board in\nsome cases coming at you. You've got your\nshareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire\nnonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you and, you know, that's\nthe really, you know, stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation\nof the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, then again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they\nclearly didn't wanna do and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I say, like I've known every CEO of Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the\njob, it was just daily beatings. Like it just getting punched in the face every single day, constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting (laughs) physically\npunched in the face, and then-\n- Getting better and better. Yeah. - You know, and he's very good\nat, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people\nto have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate\nwith like, I would say, extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in\nhis job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a\nlot about him that he has, you know, risen to this\noccasion the way that he has. And by the way, I should\nalso say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, you know, legitimate\nthing for people to say, but you know, it's like, \"Oh, you're only doing\nthis because of Trump, or, you know, whatever.\" And it's just like, no, like\nhe has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them\nout for a very long time. And so I think what\nyou saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the moment thing that could change at any time. - So what do you think it's like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal\npressure and external pressure? What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? - That's a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like, it's not a thing, right? And again, legitimately so, like CEOs get paid a lot,\nlike the whole thing. There's a lot of great things about it. So it's not like they\nshould be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that\nthey are human beings. And it is the case that\nit is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job is because your words\ncarry tremendous weight and you are dealing with\nextremely complicated issues, and you're under a tremendous\namount of emotional, you know, personal, emotional stress. And, you know, you often end\nup not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like, keep up an exercise routine\nand all those things. And you know, you come under family stress 'cause you're working all the time. Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO of our last company before\nwe started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life\nwas even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was like supposed\nto be like having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you get that a lot. But the key thing is like, you\ncan't talk to people, right? So I mean, you could talk to\nyour spouse and your kids, but like, they don't understand that they're networking in your company. They don't understand, have\nthe context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And they can't resist. Like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily\nrely on what they say. It's very hard in most\ncompanies to talk to your board because they can fire you. Now, Mark has the situation\n'cause he has control, it actually turns out he\ncan talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about\nmany things that he does that most CEOs won't talk\nto their boards about because we literally,\nbecause we can't fire him. But a general, including\nall the CEOs of Twitter, that none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the board members, they're gonna fire you, you\ncan't talk to the shareholders 'cause they'll just like\ndump your stock, right? Like, okay, so every once in a while, what you find is basically the\nbest-case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a\nlittle bit outta that. But even that's fraught with peril 'cause can you really talk\nabout confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it's just a very\nlonely isolating thing to start with. And then on top of that,\nyou apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal, external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand\nmost forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. - Hmm.\n- Right. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external\npressure you can withstand, and by that I mean\ninvestors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative article,\nyou know, negative headline and you know, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many\nof those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot withstand\nis the internal crack. And what I always look for in high-pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the\ninternal team cracks. Because I know the minute that happens, we're in a different regime. (laughs) Like, it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid. Like we're in a different regime and like the whole thing\ncan unravel in the next week 'cause then people turn, I mean this, I guess this is what's happening\nin Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire\nchief turned on each other, and that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get\nput back together again. It is over, it is not\ngoing to work ever again. And that's what happens\nto inside companies. And so somebody like Mark is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's been very good at\nmaintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,\na lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing\nI'd say, as I said, that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And especially, although not\nall one is government pressure. Is that when your\ngovernment comes for you? Like yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out\nof them in short order. - Can you just linger on that 'cause it is maybe educating\nand deeply disturbing? You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again\nthis government pressure. So you think they've crossed a line into essentially criminal\nlevels of pressure? - Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs) but yes, absolute criminality. - Can you explain how\nthose possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? - So I just start with\nis a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good 'cause it needs\nto be in the public record. And so there's three forms of things that are in the public record\nthat people can look at. So when is the Twitter Files,\nright, which Elon put out with the set of journalists\nwhen he took over. And I will just tell\nyou, the Twitter Files are 100% representative of what I've seen at every\nother one of these companies. And so you can just see\nwhat happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies,\nyou know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind\nof pressure that they got. So that's number one. That's stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven't. The second is Mark referenced\nthis in the Rogan podcast. There's a congressman Jim Jordan, who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, you\nknow, whatever three years have done a full-scale\ninvestigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have\nnow been made public and you can download those reports. And there's like 2,000 pages\nworth of material on that. And that's essentially\nthe Facebook version of the Twitter Files just arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself\ntalking about this on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just\ndefer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is\nbasically the government, you know, over time and then\nculminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years, just decided that the First\nAmendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that\nfederal laws around free speech and around conspiracies\nto take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure. They just like literally\narbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, you know, threaten repercussions and force them to censor. And you know, there's\nthis whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment\nonly applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't\napply to companies. It's like, well, there's actually a little\nbit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely\napplies to the government. Like 100%, the First Amendment\napplies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship\nregime that was put in place. There was no due process\nput in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just\nlike flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. And then there are\nspecific federal statutes, it's 18 241 and 18 242. And one of them applies to federal employees,\ngovernment employees, and the other one\napplies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United\nStates Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional\nrights are enumerated, for example, in the First\nAmendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes\naway rights that you have, they don't need to be\nspecifically enumerated rights in the Constitution order\nto still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have\nthe rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right, and so de-banking\nqualifies as a right, you know, right to access to the financial system,\nis every bit something that's subject to these\nlaws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, which is we've talked\nabout two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we've talked about the companies. The government employees\nfor sure have misbehaved. The companies, there's a very\ninteresting question there as to whether they are victims\nor perpetrators or both. You know, they will defend\nand they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims,\nnot perpetrators, right? They're the downstream\nsubjects of pressure, you know, not the cause of pressure, but there's a big swath of\npeople who are in the middle and specifically the ones that\nare funded by the government that I think are in\npossibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of these\nthird-party censorship bureaus. I mean the one that is\nsort of is most obvious is the so-called Stanford\nInternet Observatory that got booted up there\nover the last several years. And they basically were funded\nby the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in\nthis very interesting spot where there could be, you know, very obvious theory under\nwhich they're basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they're\nalso very exposed on this and have behaved in just\nflagrantly illegal ways. - So fundamentally, government should not\ndo any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? - Can't. Not allowed. - It really is disturbing. I mean it probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the the old will to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection 'cause you can't put a check\non power for government, right? - There are so many ways\nthat they can get you, like there are so many ways\nthey can come at you and get you and, you know, the thing\nhere to think about is a lot of times when people\nthink about government action, they think about legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It's like this, you know, fancy little bill sneaked\nalong and goes this- - I'm just the bill. Yeah.\n- Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. Like that doesn't actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly\nwhat we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about\ngovernment power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the\nequivalent of legislation, but having not gone through\nthe legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that\nthe DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They're regulated and there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche\nyou'll hear a lot, which is, \"Oh, private companies can\ndo whatever they want.\" It's like, \"Oh, no, they can't.\" They're subject to tens of\nthousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes\ndown when you don't comply with regulations is profound. Like they can completely\nwreck your company with no ability for you\nto do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole\nprogram a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency\nfor payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were gonna\nbuild into every product, and they were gonna be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government\nand they went to the, all these different try to\nfigure out how to make it, so it's like fully compliant\nwith anti-money laundering and all these, you know,\ncontrols and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters\nto the big banks saying, \"We're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every\naspect of your business is going to come under\ngreatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\" which is, of course, the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner\nrestaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov\ncocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? And like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a law, it's\nnot even a regulation, it's just like straight\ndirect state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they're just like flat\nout telling you what to do, which is, of course,\nwhat a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. And so anyway, so what\nthese companies experienced was they experienced the\nfull panoply of this, but the level of intensity\nwas in that order, it was actually, legislation\nwas the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important and then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were\nultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people\nwho don't do it, right? So like as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, you have to decide. You don't wanna live in\nthat regime. I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people\non the right got very angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. You know, maybe some people on the left will now not want their, you know, Democratic nominees to\nbe so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written\nin the FT just now saying, we just need like broad\nafter what we've been through in the last decade, we need to broad base\ntruth and reconciliation, you know, efforts to really\nget to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like ultimately, we need\npeople to go to jail 'cause we need to set\nobject lessons that say that you don't get to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to\nthe new administration, and I don't wanna speak for them and I don't wanna predict\nwhat they're gonna do, but they for sure have\nthe ability to do both of those things and you know,\nwe'll see where they take it. - Yeah, it's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants\nthis kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people\nthat are participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's\nthat kind of protection. Nobody wants that. - So I use the metaphor, the ring of power.\n- Yeah. - And for people who\ndon't catch the reference, that's \"Lord of the Rings.\" And the thing with the Ring of Power and \"Lord of the Rings,\"\nit's the ring the Gollum has in the beginning and\nit turns you invisible. And it turns out it like unlocks all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically, the moral\nlesson of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which was, you know, written by a guy who thought very deeply\nabout these things is, yeah, the ring of power is\ninherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they're like, \"Gandalf, just put on the\nring and like fix this.\" Right, and he will not put the ring on even to like end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. And then, you know, as it starts, the character of Gollum is\nthe result of, you know, like a normal character\nwho ultimately becomes, you know, this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. And so, I mean, I think you said something\nactually quite profound there, which is the ring of power\nis infinitely tempting. You know, the censorship\nmachine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, like\nyou are going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting\n'cause it's so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people\nfeel any of this today. They should. I don't know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years\nlater, you know, you would hope that you would realize that\nyour soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being, you know, extremely authoritarian\nand anti-democratic and anti-Western. - Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the\nmost powerful human on Earth. - I'm not sure about that. - You don't think he is? - Well, he doesn't have the nukes so. - Nukes. (Marc laughing) Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? - Yeah. - How can he and/or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting\naspects of this power? - I mean, I think the\ndanger is there with power. It's flat out there. I would say with Elon, we'll see. I would say with Elon, and\nI would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would\nsay so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost\nevery front for like, you know, the last 30 years. (Lex laughing) But including all this stuff recently, like I think he's been a\nreal hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say,\nI guess the sort of case that he has this level of\npower is that some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are, you know, are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is, I do think a lot of how\nElon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's the companies\nhe's running directly where I think he's doing very well, and we're investors in multiple\nof them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements, and then it's the downstream\neffects of his statements. So like for example, it's, you know, for the last couple weeks,\nit's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this\nrape gang scandal, you know, this rape organized child\nrape thing in the UK. And you know, it's a preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren't willing to talk about it, it kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden\nthere's now in the UK this like massive explosion\nof basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's\nkind of woken up and being like, \"Oh, my God,\nyou know, this is really bad.\" And there will be now, you know, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know,\nhe played the role of the boy who said, the emperor\nhas no clothes, right? But here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about\nsomething that was true, right? And so had he said it about\nsomething that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody\nover there instantly, they were like, \"Oh, yeah,\nhe's right,\" right? (laughs) Like nobody seriously\nsaid they're just arguing the details now. So number one, it's like,\nokay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far... Put it this way. Like, how worried are we about\nsomebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say,\nespecially in the last decade of what we've been through where everybody's been lying\nall the time about everything, I'd say, I think we\nshould run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the\nmoney and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like it,\nthere's a clear-cut case that the more money in\npolitics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic\nof public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary\noutspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost. You'll notice that money and\npolitics has all most vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Trump spent far, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don't know, something like 3 billion total in Trump, I think spent again like a\nthird or a fourth of that. And so the money in politics kind of topic has kind of vanished from\na popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit\nnow that Elon is spending. You know, but again, it's like, okay, he's spending,\nbut the data would seem to indicate in the last, at\nleast in the last eight years, that money doesn't win\nthe political battles. It's actually like the\nvoters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there I\nwould say like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and use in a definitive way. - And I don't know if\nthose parallels there, but I could also say\njust on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that's not always the case. So that's a good thing there.\n- Yeah. - If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. (laughs) Who gets to put on the ring? - [Marc] Frodo. - Frodo, yeah.\n- Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of\n\"Lord of the Rings\" right, is even Frodo would've been, you know, even Frodo would've been corrupted, right? But, you know, nevertheless,\nyou had somebody who could do what it took at at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because it's sort of our\npost-Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort of this post-secularized\nChristian context in the West now, and it's, you know, we\nconsider Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe\nessentially all the same things. We just dress them up\nin sort of fake science. (Lex laughing) So the one thing that we're all told, we're all taught from early is that the best people in\nthe world are the people who care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know,\nall of our figures are people who care about all of, you know... Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared\nabout all of humanity. Like it's this universe, the person who cares the\nmost about everybody. And with Elon, you have a\nguy who literally, like, is, he talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly\nthe same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us through\nmulti-planetary civilization, so that we can survive a\nstrike on any one planet, so that we can extend the\nlight of human consciousness into the world and, you\nknow, into the universe and have it persist, you know, in the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. (both laughing) - Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. - Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear. - You said that we\nalways end up being ruled by the elite of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? - So this comes from a\nItalian political philosopher from about 100 years ago named Robert... I'm gonna mangle it from, let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. And then I learned about\nit through a famous book on politics, probably the\nbest book on politics written in the 20th century called \"The Machiavellians\"\nby this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in \"The Machiavellians,\" he resurrects what he calls is this sort of Italian realist school of political philosophy from the '10s and '20s. And\nthese were people, to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who\nwere trying to understand the actual mechanics of how\npolitics actually works. So to get to the actual sort\nof mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, Michels\nhad this concept ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law of oligarchy, and I mean take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy 'cause it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there's basically three\nforms of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of many. There's oligarchy, which\nis rule of the few. And there's monarchy,\nwhich is rule of the one. And you can just use that\nas a general framework of any government you're gonna be under is gonna be one of those,\njust mechanical observation without even saying\nwhich one's good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that\nMichels asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like is there actually\nsuch a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually\nlike direct government? And what he did was he mounted this sort of\nincredible historical exploration of whether democracies had\never existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most\ndemocratic private organization in the world that he\ncould find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist\nGerman autoworkers union that was like wholly\ndevoted to the workers of the world uniting, you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization\nout of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and\nhe is like, \"Oh, nope.\" There's a leadership class. You know, there's like six guys at the top and they control everything (laughs) and then they lead the rest\nof the membership along, you know, by the nose, which is, of course, the\nstory of every union. The story of every union is\nalways the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers' union, right? Like, you know, there's\na guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number\ntwo is his son, right? Like, that's not like a, you\nknow, an accident, right? So the iron law oligarchy\nbasically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling\nelite structurally. And he said, \"The reason for that is because the masses\ncan't organize,\" right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is\n25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize,\nthe majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in\npolitics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a\nsmall organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence... I forget the name of it. It was called like The Workers' Revolt or something like that. There was like a two-year period where they basically experimented\nwith direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition\nsystem, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. You know, anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes\nit's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe, and it's caused enormous\ndamage to the state. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And so of course, they didn't\ngive us a direct democracy, they gave us a representative\ndemocracy, right? And so they built the\noligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch\nand the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson\nof \"The Machiavellians\" is you can deny that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think\nabout how to make a system work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that\nis actually what's happening. - And lucky for us, the founders saw this\nand figured out a way to, given that there's going\nto be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite-\n- Yes. - So it doesn't get out of hand. - And it was very clever. Right? And you know, some of this was\nbased on earlier experiments. By the way, you know, these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of like Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance\nhistory, you know, \"The Federalist Papers,\" they\nargue this a great length. You can read it all. You know, they ran like a\none of the best seminars in world history trying\nto figure this out. And they went through all this and yeah. And so they thought\nthrough it very carefully, but just, I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did it just through the three\nbranches of government, right? Executive, legislative and judicial, sort of balance of powers. But the other way, they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done earlier. I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, right? And so the, you know,\nthe House and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population,\nand the Senate is not, right? The small states have\njust as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get\nreelected every two years to make it very responsive\nto the will of the people. And they made the decision\nto have the Senate get reelected every six years\nso that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose\none or the other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does\nit live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And you know, there's lots of open\nquestions there, but you know, this system has survived\nfor coming on 250 years with a country that has been\nspectacularly successful. But I don't think, at least,\nyou know, I don't think any of us would trade the\nsystem for any other one. And so it's, yeah, one of the\ngreat all-time achievements. - Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were\nall pretty young relative to our current set of leaders.\n- They were. Many in their 20s at the\ntime, and like super geniuses. This is one of those things\nwhere it's just like, all right, something happened where there\nwas a group of people where, you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einsteins of politics. Yeah. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical\npractice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused\non what would actually work, which is, you know, I\nthink the way to think about these things. - There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. - They were shape rotators,\nnot word cells. (laughs) - I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were center to them, you're center to a lot of memes. - [Marc] I was. - You're the meme dealer\nand the meme popularizer. - That's true. That meme I get some credit for and then the current thing is, the other one I get some credit for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. - Take credit and run with it. - [Marc] Yep. - If we can just linger\non the Machiavellians. It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned looking\nat the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've\nseen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting\nthings you can sort of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? - Yeah, so a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this\na bit with the universities, which is you can apply a\nMachiavellian-style lens to the... It's why I posed the\nquestion to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the\nuniversity, the trustees, the administration, the\nstudents or the faculty? And you know, the true\nanswer is some combination of the three or of the\nfour, plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera, right? And so you know, there's a mechanical\ninterpretation of that. I mean, companies operate\nunder the exact same, you know, set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like the CEO runs the\ncompany basically up to the day that either the shareholders\nor the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt,\nit's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it's very hard for the\nCEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if The New\nYork Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand\nis who can get who fired? You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper\ncolumnist who makes, you know, $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes, you\nknow, $200 million a year. And it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before\nI have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. - Did anyone ever get fired\nfrom the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? (laughs) So Bill like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. - No, 'cause what happens\nis they wear it with a... And yeah, I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, right? Which is, you know, if\nthey're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably\npriding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to legitimate criticism and, you know, they're\nobviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight\nto the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. You know, and I happen to know the CEO, and I think he's quite a good CEO, but I like, well, this is a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer\nrun his own company, right? Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating\nplaying out right now. Not to dwell on these fires, but you see the pressure\nreveals things, right? And so if you've been\nwatching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, like whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical\nsocial revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It's endorses every crazy\nleft-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of\nall the people who, you know, are currently burning\nthe city to the ground. It's just like endorsed\nevery single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, for the first time, I think put his foot down right\nbefore the November election and said, we're getting... He said, \"We're gonna get outta this thing where we just always\nendorse the Democrat.\" And we said, we're not\nendorsing, I think he said, \"We're not endorsing for the presidency.\" And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like our billionaire backer who's... And I don't know what he spends, but like, he must be burning 50 or 100\nmillion dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. He paid 500 million for\nit, which is amazing. Back when people still thought\nthese things were businesses. And then he's probably\nburned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another\n50, 100 million a year to do this. And the journalists at\nthe LA Times hate him with the fury of 1,000 suns. Like they just like absolutely\nfreaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones that\ncan get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, you know,\nmost horrible things about him. And they wanna constantly run\nthese stories attacking him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in\nLA are having right now to this fire, and to this just like\nincredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head\nendorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour,\nhe's basically just, he's decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his\nown newspaper. (laughs) Very smart guy. He is not a press tour and\nhe is basically saying, yeah, yes, we did all that and we\nendorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and\nwe're gonna completely change. And his paper is, you know,\nin a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn't been him. (laughs) It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, the\nowner is showing up saying, \"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge.\" And the reporters are\nsaying, \"No, you're not.\" And like it is freaking on. And so again, if the, the\nMachiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power\nactually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and super powerful who even\nowns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full-scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist? - And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there. - And firing people.\n- Firing people. Yeah. - You know, he has removed\npeople and he has set new rules. I mean, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying he's now at long last actually\nexercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other\nowners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know, so\nhe's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really\ninteresting open question. Like, you know, in a fight\nbetween the employees and the employer, like\nit's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. - And just to stay on\njournalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just wanna say put him in\nthe category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever\nseen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. - What do you think is like\nthe most impressive example? - Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to, like, I mean, it's like kicking\nthe beehive or whatever, you know, what's gonna follow and do that. I mean that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia\nand then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer\njust tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. And just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people\nlike that out in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be\ncourageous themselves. - Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? - I knew of Neri, his wife, who's a brilliant\nresearcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she's amazing. - Well, the reason I ask\nif you knew about Bill is because a lot of people\nhad not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before some of the\ncampaigns he's been running since in public, and with\nHarvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he was so-called activist\ninvestor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected\nfor probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out, they weren't for the most part battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national\nstories, but in the business and investing world, the\nactivist investor is a very, it's like in the movie \"Taken.\" It's a very specific set of skills. (both laughing) - Yeah. - On how to like really take control of situations.\n- Yeah. - And how to wreck the people\nwho you're going up against. And there's been\ncontroversy over the years on this topic, and there's\ntoo much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid is,\nyou know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly\nmanaged or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that\nmeans the existing management is become entrenched and\nlazy, mediocre, you know, whatever. Not, you're responding to the\nneeds of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically\ngo in with a minority position and then they rally support\namong other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show\nup and they force change. But they are the\naggressive version of this. And I've been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these-\n- Oh-oh. - Where it is amazing\nhow much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don't have formal control. So it would be another chess\npiece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens\nis the effective analysts, a large amount of time, they end up taking over\ncontrol of companies even though they never own more than like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it\nturns out with Bill's, it's such a fascinating case. 'Cause he has that like complete skillset. - (laughs) Yeah. - And he has now decided\nto bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of\nthese places, you know, and some of these battles\nare still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of\npeople who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now\nwith infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that\nkind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook, like in real time. And so Liam Neeson skillset is\ngetting more broadly diffused just by being able to\nwatch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody\nwho's really affecting how all this is playing out. - But even skillset\naside just courage and- - Yes, including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, 'cause like he hasn't been, I'll give you an example. Like my firm venture\ncapital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I\nfeel like I can't do or say 'cause I feel like I would\nbe bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where\nhe worries about that. And so a couple things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship\nwith his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors...\nI know this for a fact. His investors have been\nremarkably supportive of him doing that. 'Cause as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. And so it is the same thing he does in the his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip\nof the spear on something that actually a lot\nmore people agree with. - Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. - And just again, our, you know, how I started is a lot of\npeople are just fed up. - You've been spending a\nbunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new\nadministration in many ways, including interviewing\npeople who might join. So what's your general\nsense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new administration? - So I should start by saying I'm not a member of\nthe new administration. I'm not like in the room\nwhen a lot of these people are being selected. - I believe you said unpaid intern. - I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and I,\nyou know, when helpful, but I'm not making the decisions,\nnor am I in a position to, you know, speak for the administration. So I don't wanna say anything that would cause people\nto think I'm doing that. It's a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is outta office, and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll recall,\nthere was a fair amount of controversy over the\nend of the first term. - Oh, yeah. - The specific concern was, you know, the first Trump administration, you know, they will all say this is like, they didn't come in with a team, right? So you know, they didn't\ncome in with a team and most of the sort of institutional base of the Republican Party\nwere Bush Republicans. And many of them had\nbecome never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time\nputting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time\ngetting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them 2 to 3\nyears to kind of even get the government in place. And then they basically only\nhad the government in place, you know, for basically like\n18 months, and then COVID hit. You know, and then sort of\nthe aftermath and everything, and all the drama and\nheadlines and everything. And so the concern, you know, including from some various smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he gonna be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? 'Cause maybe people got burned out. Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing\nto go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people\nin the first term came under, like, you know, with their\nown withering legal assaults, and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a\nlot of stuff happened, lots of investigations,\nlots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots\nof debanking, by the way. A lot of the officials in the\nfirst Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. - Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. - In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and\nchildren with our ring of power. And so there's like\nthis legitimate question as to like, whether, okay, what will the team for\nthe second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing\nwith the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks\nbetter than the first term and not 'cause the\npeople in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like, influx of like incredibly\ncapable people that have shown up that wanna be part of this, and you just didn't have\nthat the first time. And so they're just\ndrawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than\nthey had the first time. And they're drawing on people\nwho know what the game is. Like they're drawing\non people now who know what is gonna happen and\nthey're still willing to do it. And so they're gonna\nget, I think, you know, some of the best people\nfrom the first term, but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get\nthe first time around. And then second is\nthere's a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they're just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned\nhow everything works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view and now they're 10 years older and they're ready to\ngo serving government. And so there's a\ngenerational shift happening. And actually one of the\ninteresting things about the team that's forming up is\nit's remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members,\nand then many of the second and third level people are\nlike in their 30s and 40s, you know, which is a big change\nfrom the gerontocracy that, you know, we've been under\nfor the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has\nbeen outstanding, you know, and we could sit here and\nlist tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people\nwho are running, you know, it's everything from the people who are running all the\ndifferent departments at HHS. It's the people running, you know, the number two at the\nPentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got, actually two of\nmy partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah, like many, many\nparts of the government, the people are like, really impressive. - Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the\nhuman being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's kind of circles\nof sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically\nsuck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good\nposition to speak to the degree that's happening versus\nhiring based on merit and just getting great teams. - Yeah, so look, I just\nstart by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are, you know, very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. Like he definitely seems\nvery aware of that. So that's one thing. I would just say that the, I\nthink the way to look at that, I mean, and look, like I said, I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say that it's again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished\npeople in the business world and in the medical field. I just, you know, Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH, so I was actually, I was\npart of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. - Nice. Jay's amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. - So I literally got, this is a story. I got to the transition\noffice for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the\ninterview interviewing teams, and they gave us, I didn't\nknow who the candidates were, and they gave us the\nsheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I\nsaw Jay's name, and I, like, I almost physically fell outta my chair. - Yeah. - And I was just like... (laughs) You know, and\nI happen to know Jay, I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like, talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure- - Yeah.\n- Over the last five years. - And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and\nthoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly- - Very serious, very\nanalytical, very applied. And yes, 100%. Tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look\nback at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you\nknow, none of us are perfect, but like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And, you know, we would all\nbe much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just like an\nincredibly capable guy. And look, and then he\nlearned from all that, right? He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody\nlike that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly. It's just a gigantic upgrade. You know, and then Marty\nMakary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a\nCDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been\nspending time with Dr. Oz, so, you know, and I'm not, like, again, I'm not on these teams. I'm not in the room. But like, I've been\nspending enough time trying to help that, like his level of insight into the healthcare system,\nit's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy\nwho's been like in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this\nstuff and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for,\nyou know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, he's like a walking\nencyclopedia on these things. And you know, very dynamic, you know, very charismatic, very\nsmart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have\nsomebody like that in there. And so anyway, they're\njust, I have like 30 of these stories now across\nall these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast\nto the last four years. And it, not even, these people\nare not in the same ballpark. They're just like wildly better. And so it, you know, the pound for pound is\nmaybe be the best team in the White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team\nlike this or something. But there's a lot of really\ngood people in there now. - Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to DOGE? What's the most wildly successful\nnext two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also, can you think\nabout the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges\nwould it be facing? - Yeah, so start by\nsaying, again, I'm not... Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer, I'm not on DOGE, (laughs)\nI'm not a member of DOGE. - We should say there's\nabout 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring. No, I'm just kidding. - Both the angels and\nthe devils on my shoulder are-\n- Okay. All right, cool. - So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE. I'm not in charge of DOGE.\n- Yeah. - Those guys are doing\nit, I'm not doing it. But you know, again,\nI'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, I mean, the basic outlines\nare in public, right? Which it's a time limited, you\nknow, basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the\nexecutive branch, right? And so the implementation\nwill happen through the White House. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is the three kind of streams,\nyou know, kind of target sets, and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. And so, you know, the headline\nnumber, they, you know, put us the $2 trillion number and there's already, you know, disputes over that and whatever, and there's whole question there. But then there's the people thing. And the people thing is\ninteresting 'cause you get into these very kind of\nfascinating questions. And I've been doing this,\nI won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this\nfor people in government as a pop quiz, and I can stump\nthem every time, which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere\nbetween 450 and 520. And nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for\nthe federal government? And the answer is, you know,\nsomething on the order, I forget, but like 4\nmillion full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large\npeople component to this. And then by the way, there's\na related component to that, which is how many of them\nare actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings\nare still empty, right? And then there's questions\nof like, are people, you know, working from home? Or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension, and of course, the money and\nthe people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing, right? And I described earlier\nhow basically our system of government is much more\nnow based on regulations than legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that\nwent through Congress. They're from an agency that,\nthat created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is, Elon have already described, we wanna do the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the\ngovernment off people's backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. But there's also something\nelse that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set\nof Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that\nwent directly after the idea that the executive branch can\ncreate regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding\ncongressional legislation. And most of the federal\ngovernment that exists today, including most of the departments\nand most of the rules, and most of the money,\nand most of the people, most of it is not enforcing\nlaws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \"Large parts, you know, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress,\nthe way that the cartoon said that it should, that may\nnot actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to, they\ndid nothing based on this. They didn't, you know,\npull anything back in. But the new regime, if they\nchoose to, could say, \"Look, the thing that we're doing here is not, you know, challenging the laws, we're actually complying with\nthe Supreme Court decision that basically says we have\nto unwind a lot of this, and we have to unwind the regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional, we have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people.\" And that's how you get from, basically you connect the\nthread from the regulation part back to the money part,\nback to the people part. They have work going on\nall three of these threads. They have, I would say,\nincredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super\ncynical on this topic. And they're like, \"This is impossible. This could never possibly work.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I can't tell you what the secret plans are,\nbut like blow my mind.\" And all three of those,\nlike, they have ideas that are like really quite\namazing as you'd expect from, you know, from the people involved. And so over the course of the\nnext few months, you know, that'll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is, this is going to be very\ndifferent than attempts, like there have been other\nprograms like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one, and then there were others\nbefore that, Reagan had one. The difference is this\ntime, their social media. And so there has never been like, it's interesting, one of the\nreasons people in Washington are so cynical is because\nthey know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad\nspending and all the bad rules and all the, like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion\ndollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that's compounding, and\nit's now passing the size of the defense department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon it's gonna\nbe adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be\nadding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point we enter a\nhyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or\nBrazil and (indistinct), right? And so, like everybody in\nDC knows that something has to be done, and then\neverybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible\nto do anything, right? They know all the problems and they also know the sheer\nimpossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're\nnot taking into account, that what the critics are not taking into account\nis these guys can do this in the full light of day and\nthey can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism, they can expose any element\nof, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government spending. They can run victory\nlapse every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the\npeople into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our\nMachiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy,\noligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of\nthe few, rule of the one. You could think about what's\nhappening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president, rule\nof the one with some power. And then we have the\npeople who can't organize, but they can be informed\nand they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich\nhappening right now, is a way to think about it, which is you've got basically (indistinct) if you got rule of one combining with the rule of many, right? And rule of many is they\ndo get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically. And then essentially\nCongress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic\nclass in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, I think have the power to\ndo all kinds of things here, and I think that would be\nthe way I would wash it. - The transparency. I mean, Elon, just by\nwho he is incentivized to be transparent and show\nthe bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's gonna be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just\nmakes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. - These people are spending our money. - [Lex] Yeah. - These people have enormous\ncontempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here's the thing\nyou hear in Washington, here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear\nis, \"This is impossible, they'll be able to do nothing.\" And then, yeah, I walk them\nthrough this and they're like, it starts to dawn on them that\nthis is a new kind of thing. And then they're like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in\nentitlements and the debt and the military.\" And so like, yeah, you've\ngot like this silly, fake whatever, you know,\nNPR funding or whatever, and like, it's a rounding\nerror and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever,\n$500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging\nstations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they bill eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And costs you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn't matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer\nis like, \"What the fuck?\" (Lex laughing) - What do you mean?\n- It's $30 billion. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then the experts are like, and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's surrounding error.\" No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this\ncavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you're\nabout the 3 trillion. - Yeah.\n- Okay. Then there's the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the\nfederal budget and percentage? No, it's not. But $30 billion divided\nby 30, do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like, what's that math expert? - $100. - $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic\nrelationship with your wife. There's like 100 things\nthat that person can do with $100 that they're not doing 'cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where\nthe money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that $30\nbillion program is not something that is like a very\nimportant thing to go after, is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer-\n- Yeah. - Is just off the charts. And then that's just\none of those programs, there's like 100 of those programs and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of\nthis stuff is running well, like the one thing we know is that none of this\nstuff is running well. Like we know that for sure, right? And we know these people\naren't showing up to work and like we know that all this crazy stuff is happening, right? And like, you know, do you remember Elon's\nstory of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. Okay so Pennsylvania is\nlike a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness, and death, right? And the federal government\nhas just like, let it happen, these incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing\nlaw enforcement thing that they needed to do in\nPennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling\nraw milk with armed raids. - [Lex] Right. - And it turns out it\nreally pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places\n'cause they don't have cars. But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the\nreasons why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law\nenforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, like the system's not working. And so you add up, just\npick $130 billion programs. All right, now you're okay. Math major, 100 times 100. - 10,000. - $10,000. Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. - But it's also not just about money. That's really, obviously money\nis a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude- - [Marc] Yes. - That then in sort of, in\nthe ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody\nwants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that corruption\ncan, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy 'cause you don't wanna be transparent about having done nothing all\nyear, all this kind of stuff. And you now wanna reverse that, so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government,\nbecause the amazing thing if you're to steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can\ndirectly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting. As long as there's no\nbureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. - Yeah. So here's the trick, this blew my mind 'cause I was, you know, once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in\ngovernment called impoundment. And so if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning\nis a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires\nCongress to authorize money to be spent by the\nexecutive branch, right? So the executive branch\ngoes to Congress says, \"We need money X.\" Congress does their thing. They come back and they\nsay, \"You can have money Y.\" The money's appropriated from Congress, the executive branch\nspends it on the military or whatever they spend it\non, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations\nto nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an\nadditional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which\nis the executive branch not only needs Congress to\nappropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is\nnot allowed to underspend. - Yeah, I'm aware of\nthis. I'm aware of this. - And so there's this thing\nthat happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal\nyear, which is September 30th, and it's the great budget flush. And any remaining money\nthat's in the system that they don't know how\nto productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively. - Yep. - To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn't wanna spend the\nmoney can't not spend it. - Yeah. - Like, okay, A, that's not\nwhat's in the constitution. And there's actually quite\na good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that's played\nout in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I\nthink an open mind, you're like, \"All right, this is not\nwhat the founders meant.\" And then number two, again,\nwe go back to this thing of contempt, like, can\nyou imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you're\ndoing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've\nsold your soul, right? Like it's just like, I actually\nthink you sort of had it in a really good point,\nwhich is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. - Yeah.\n- Right. 'Cause it makes them bad people. And they didn't start out\nwanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this like- - Yeah, everywhere.\n- Everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged\nwhat I've seen so far. - It seems like a lot of people\nwill try to slow 'em down, but yeah-\n- For sure. - I hope they get far.\n- Yeah. - Another difficult topic, immigration. - [Marc] Yeah. - What's your take on the, let's say, heated H-1B visa debate\nthat's going on online and legal immigration in general? - Yeah, I should so start by saying, I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I'm not planning to be,\nthis is not an issue that I'm working on or\nthat I'm going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing.\nSo my firm is doing, so like, I'm not in this in the new\nadministration or the government. I'm not planning to be, so\npurely just personal opinion. So I would say I would\ndescribe as a complex or nuanced, hopefully\nnuanced view on this issue that's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I kind of thought\nabout this, you know, I didn't say anything about\nit all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a\nlot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a\nvery different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because\nof the combination of where I came from and\nthen where I ended up. And so, oh, let's start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration\nargument many, many times the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been\nin DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of\ntrying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more\nhigh-skilled immigration. And, you know, I think that\nargument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, has paid off for the\nUS in many, many ways. And we can go through it,\nbut I think it's the argument everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's, right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. - So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you\ncan get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity\nof the US companies. - Yeah, and then it's not just good for the them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry,\nit's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that\nthen create many more jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would've previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Like everybody wins,\nthere are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely\nglorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be\na moral right argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against\nit is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right, I mean that-\n- Right. - That's the thing. And like I said, I've made\nthat argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd also say, look,\nI would say number one, I believe a lot of it,\nI'll talk about the parts I don't believe, but\nI believe a lot of it. And then the other part is,\nlook, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, like\nmy own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends, you know,\nare just this like amazing, you know, panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And you know, I've worked,\nI dunno at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And hopefully, over time, it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And you know, it's been amazing and they've done many of\nthe most important things in my industry and it's\nbeen really remarkable. So that's all good. And then, you know, there's\njust the practical version of the argument, which\nis we are the main place these people get educated anyway, right? The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, this is the old kind of Mitt\nRomney, staple a green card to every, you know, at least, you know, maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologist\nwe could quibble about, but you know, the roboticist\nfor sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- - At least I won you\nover on something today. - Well, no, I'm\nexaggerating for effect, so- - Oh. (Marc laughing) And I lost you,\nI had you for half a second. - I haven't gotten to the\nother side of the argument yet. - [Lex] Okay, thank you.\n- So surely, we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. - The rollercoaster is going up. - The rollercoaster is\nrationing slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists\nshould all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot\nof merit to that, obviously. Like, look, we want the\nUS to be the world leader in robotics. What step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the\ngreat robotics people, right? Like, you know, very,\nunlike the underpants. No, it's like a very\nstraightforward formula, right? - Yeah. - All right, that's all\nwell and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that you also hear from,\nyou know, these same people, and I have made this\nargument myself many times, which is, we need to do this because we don't have\nenough people in the US who can do it otherwise, right? We have all these unfilled\njobs, we've got all these, you know, all these companies\nthat wouldn't exist. We don't have enough good founders, we don't have enough engineers, we don't have enough scientists. Or then the next version\nof the argument below that is our education\nsystem is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way, 'cause like our education\nsystem is good enough for foreigners to be able\nto come here preferentially in like a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native-born people. So there's like a weird, there's\nlittle cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into and kind of wonder about, and we'll come back to that one. But like, at least, yes, our\neducation system has its flaws. And then underneath that is\nthe argument that, you know, Vivek made, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, you know, native-born\npeople in the country, you know, don't work hard enough, and spend too much time\nwatching TV and TikTok and don't spend enough\ntime studying differential, you know, equations. And again, it's like, all\nright, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair amount to that. Like there's a lot of American\nculture that is, you know, there's a lot of frivolity,\nthere's a lot of, you know, like, I mean, we have\nwell-documented social issues in many fronts, many things that cut\nagainst having a culture of just like straightforward\nhigh achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those\nare the basic arguments. But then I have this kind of\nother side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought\nprocess, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And you know, it's interesting,\nthere's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin\nto, you know, high tech. And so it's like, all right,\nwhy is that exactly, right? And then I know this, I'm an aberration. Like I was the only one\nfrom anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right? I know what an aberration I am, and I know exactly how\nthat aberration happened, and it's a very unusual,\nyou know, set of steps, including, you know,\nmany that were just luck. But like, there is in\nno sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like, not at all. There is also like, in no sense\na talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from\nthe South into high tech. There is no flow from the\nSunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the Deep South into high tech. Just like, literally it's like the blank. There's this whole section of the country that just where the people\njust like for some reason don't end up in tech. Now, that's a little bit strange, 'cause these are the people\nwho put a man on the moon. These are the people who built\nthe World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the Second\nIndustrial Revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network, and built, you know,\nlogistics and transportation in the auto in, I mean,\nthe auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people's\nparents and grandparents and great grandparents\nsomehow had the wherewithal to like build all of\nthis like amazing things, invent all these things. And then there's many,\nmany, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism\nwhere you had people who grew up in the middle of\nnowhere, Philo Farnsworth, who invented the television,\nand just like, you know, tons and tons of others,\nendless stories like this. Now you have a, like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, okay, like what is happening on\nthe blank spot of the map? And then of course, you\nalso can't help noticing that the blank spot on the\nmap, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, \"Oh,\nwell, that's interesting. Like how did that happen?\" Right? And so either you really,\nreally, really have to believe the very, very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you\nhave to believe that like, that basically culture, the\nwhole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country\nis so like, deeply flawed, either inherently flawed\nor culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they are not able to do the\nthings that their, you know, parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess\non what else is happening? - You mean what, affirmative action? - Affirmative action. Okay. (laughs) This is\nvery, think about this, this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. - Right. - Nor does it have any victims at all. - That could explain\nmaybe disproportionate, but like, surely it doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. - What educational institution\nin the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? - But what institution rejected\nfarm boys from Wisconsin? - All of them.\n- All of them. - Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this\nis because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago, these were big court cases. And you know, 'cause the\nidea of affirmative action has been litigated for\nmany, many, many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly\nin the past had upheld that it was a completely\nlegitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative action that\nlike really matter, right? One is the admissions into\neducational institutions, and then the other is jobs, right? Getting hired. Like, those are the two biggest areas. The education one is like super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time, for all, you know, people have written and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments\nfor why it's important, there's many arguments as\nto how it could backfire. It's been this thing. But the Supreme Court upheld\nit for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer, I don't\nhave the exact reference in my head, but there was a\ncase in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O'Connor famously\nwrote that, you know, although it had been 30\nyears of affirmative action, and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended,\nshe said that, you know, well, basically we need to\ntry it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically\nthe issues it's intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming\nup on the 25 years, right? It's a couple years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases is, it's a Harvard case and I think a University\nof North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those\ncases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions\nactually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit\nas cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it's a ring of power. And if you're an admissions\nofficer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power\nto do what you want, and you can justify any of\nit under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases,\nit had been a black box where you didn't have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically\nrequired showing the work. And there was like all kinds\nof like phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there\nwere text messages in there that will just curl your hair of people, of students being spoken of and just like crude racial stereotypes that would just make you\nwant to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. But also, there was\nstatistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is\nthat at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs\nfor SAT that are as wide as 400 points, right? So different groups. So a specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points\nhigher than other ethnicities in order to actually\nget admitted into these. I mean, this is not even about, I mean, white people are a part of this, but like Asians are like\na very big part of this. And actually the Harvard\ncase is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students\nwho were being turned away. And it's basically, I\nmean it's the cliche now in the valley and in\nthe medical community, which is like if you want a super genius, you hire an Asian from Harvard 'cause they are guaranteed\nto be freaking Einstein. 'Cause if they weren't, they were never getting admitted, right? Almost all the qualified\nAsians get turned away. So they've been running this,\nit's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been\na third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really\nchanged the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthey can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a\nsingle education institution in America that is conforming\nwith the Supreme Court ruling. I think they're all\nflagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. - Mostly 'cause of\nmomentum probably, or what? - They are trying to make\nthe world a better place. They're trying to solve\nall these social problems. They are trying to have\ndiverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They're trying to make\ntheir faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they're good people. - [Lex] Right. - They're trying to have\nthe press write nice things about them. Like it's nearly impossible for them. And you know, to be clear,\nlike nobody has been fired from an admissions office for,\nyou know, 25 years of prior, what we now, the Supreme Court now is\nruled to be illegality. And so they're all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so like I, you know, the numbers are moving a little bit, but like, I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they're\ncompliant with the Supreme Court. Like who's in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university's rule of the\nSupreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules\nthe universities, right? Well, another example of that is, I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right\nnow went to either Harvard or Yale, right? Like the level of\nincestuousness here is... Anyway, so there's that. And so this has been running\nfor a very long time. So one is the Harvard and\nUSC cases kind of gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the\nother thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was\nhappening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at\nall the top institutions for Jewish applicants was\nthey were being managed down, either being actively\nmanaged down as a percentage of the base. And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely\nexplicit, basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative\npercentage of the US population, which is 2%. And you know, there's\na whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago,\nJews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big\ncampaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became\n30% of these institutions 'cause there's so many\nsmart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been\ntrying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish\npeople I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, right? And so all of a sudden, so basically, the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this\nin terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in\nterms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? And then, of course, there's the thing that you\nbasically can't talk about, which is all the white\npeople are being excluded. And then it turns out it's\nalso happening to Black people, and this is the thing that like blew my freaking\nmind when I found out about it. So I just assumed that\nlike, this was great news for like American Blacks, because like, you know, obviously\nif you know Whites, Asians and Jews are being excluded,\nthen, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was\nto get the Black population up. And so this must be great\nfor American Blacks. So then I discovered this New\nYork Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? (laughs) - [Lex] Uh-oh. - And again, and by the way,\nthis is in The New York Times, this is not in like, you know, whatever, National Review,\nthis is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that\nwere quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the dean of the\nAfrican-American Studies, you know, community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme\nCourt appointee under, I think she was a close\nfriend of Hillary Clinton. And there was, for a long time, she was on the shortlist\nfor Supreme Court. So one of the top, you know, jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black was sort\nof legendarily successful in the academic and\nlegal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the\nauthorities in this story and the story that they tell, (laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education institutions and\nit's happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government, which\nis at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard\nwere not American-born Blacks. They were foreign-born Blacks, specifically, Northern\nAfrican off generally Nigerian or West Indian, right? And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very\nsuccessful Nigerian-Americans as a group like way outperformed, they're, you know, this a\nsuper smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said\nin the story is Harvard is basically struggling to\neither, whatever it was, identify or recruit, make successful, whatever it was,\nAmerican-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were\nusing high-skill immigration, as an escape hatch to go get\nBlacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs in the last 20 years have had\nthis exact characteristic. There's large numbers of\nBlack people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \"It's obviously not us that\nare getting these slots, we're literally competing with people who are being imported.\" And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action,\nyou are trying to make up for historical injustice\nof American Black slavery. So the idea that you're import\nsomebody from, you know, Nigeria that never\nexperienced that, you know, is like tremendously\ninsulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see\nwhere I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year\nsocial engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into, right? And so it turns out it's\nnot a victim-free thing, there's like 100%, there's victims. 'Cause why? There's only so many, for sure. There's only so many education slots. And then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs, right? You know, Google only\nhires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers, right? And so that's the other side of it, right? And so you're a farm\nboy in Wisconsin, right? You know, Black American\nwhose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship,\n300 years ago, in Louisiana or a, you know, Cambodian\nimmigrant in, you know, the Bronx and you are a kid or a Jewish\nimmigrant or a, you know, or from a very successful Jewish family and you know, your entire, you\nknow, for three generations, you and your parents and\ngrandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those\ngroups know is the system that has been created\nis not for them, right? It's designed specifically\nto exclude them. And then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, \"Yeah, let's bring\nin more foreigners,\" right? And so anyway, so the\nshort version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the, quote,\n\"high-skill immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also\nhaving the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another\nword for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative\naction conversation. And you need to actually\ndeal with this at substance and to see what's actually\nhappening to people. you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for\nhigh-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took\nover both the education process and the hiring process.\n- Okay, so first of all, that was brilliantly laid\nout, the nuance of it. So just to understand, it's\nnot so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to\nbe more people saying, yay, we need more American-born hires. - So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on\nthis and not saying anything, and what I was... (Lex laughing) Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of- - Yeah, that was very Zen. - Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of\nit, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the\ndog that didn't bark, right? And the dog that didn't\nbark was, I did not, and you tell me if you saw one, I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart\nkids who are already here into these educational\ninstitutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. - That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.\n- But it was like literally, it was like the proponents\nof high-skilled immigrant. And again, this was me\nfor a very long time. I mean, I kind of took\nmyself by surprise on this because I was on, you\nknow, I had the much, say, simpler version of this\nstory for a very... And like I said, I've been\nin Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But you know, I've been on\nthe other side of this one, but I was literally sitting\nthere being like, all right, which of these like super\ngeniuses who, you know, many of whom by the\nway are very, you know, successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled\nimmigrants, you know, which of these super\ngeniuses are gonna like, say actually we have this like\nincredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about native-born\nAmericans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure. Those four groups. - But also-\n- Yes. - White people. - Yeah, and also white people. - People that are making the\ncase for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're\nmaking that case are often not making it in a way that's like, making it in quite a radical way. - Yeah.\n- Let's put it this way. - Yeah, but you have\nthis interesting thing, you have a split between\nthe sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. - Right. - Right, and I'm using air\nquote for people listening to audio. I'm making quotes\nin the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can.\n- Yep. - One side has all the certified experts. The other side just has a\nbunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite\nknow how to explain it. And what was so unusual\nabout the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of Supreme Court, is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time, actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record, they actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, 'cause if you don't have\nexperts, what do you have? You know, something is wrong, but you have primarily\nan emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, you know, that\na certified expert can? And no, you can't, like, you\nknow, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. Yeah, and so it's just\nlike, all right, now, by the way, look, I think there are ways\nto square the circle, I think there's a way to\nhave our cake and eat it too, like I think there'd be\nmany ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with\nhigh-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is\nunder much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for\nuniversities to do that, they are still doing it,\nbut they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part, that's happening\nfor a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate\nlawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court\nrulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just as a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let add one more nuance to it that makes it even more complicated. - Yeah. - So the cliche is we're gonna\nbrain drain the world, right? You've heard that? We're gonna take all the smart people from all over the world,\nwe're gonna bring them here, we're gonna educate them, and\nthen we're gonna keep them, and then they're gonna\nraise their families here, create businesses here,\ncreate jobs here, right? - In the cliche, that's\na super positive thing. - Yeah. Okay, so what happens to\nthe rest of the world? - They lose? - Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious,\nhighly conscientious, highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that\nmany and they all come here and they all aren't where\nthey would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So it's almost impossible\nfor us here to have that conversation, in part because we become\nincredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just\nsimply all the same, which is a whole thing\nwe could talk about. But it also, we are purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the\nworld, not the other way around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow\nof high-skilled immigration over time, there's only\nfour permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration\nplaces people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. - Oh, Australia. - It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four\ncountries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk\nabout this I've discovered because the Eurozone\nis, whatever, you know, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over\ntime have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I\nthink it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've\nbeen migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this\nreally hit the fan was in Greece, right? So, you know, Greece falls\ninto chaos, disaster, and then, you know, you're\nrunning the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic\ndevelopment plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. Like, what are you gonna do, right? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. Not because, in part, because of this, 'cause we enthusiastically\nrecruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining\nUkraine for a long time. But also, of course,\nyou know, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, you know, when it comes\ntime for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it\ngonna have the talent base even that it had five years ago is like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, like\nwe have brain drained a lot of really smart people outta Russia, a lot of them are here, right? Over the last, you know, 30 years. And so there's this thing, it's actually really funny\nif you think about it. Like, the one thing that\nwe know to be the height of absolute evil that the\nWest ever did was colonization and resource extraction, right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and\nthe English and you know, everybody else went and had\nthese colonies and then went in and we, you know, took all the oil and we took all the diamonds,\nor we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason we realized\nthat's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's\ncompletely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious\nand beautiful and wonderful and you know, the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral\njustice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one\nsecond what we're doing to the countries that we're\npulling all these people out of. And this is one of these\nthings like, I don't know, like maybe we're just gonna live in this delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't care what happens, but like, I think there may come, this is like one of these submarines 10 feet under the waterline. Like, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly\nrealize, \"Oh, my God, what are we doing?\" 'Cause like, we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? Like we need these other\ncountries to like flourish. Like we don't wanna be the\nonly successful country in the middle of just like\ncomplete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and\nwe extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it. - Well, this is so deeply\nprofound, actually. So what is the cost\n\"winning\" quote, unquote, if these countries are drained\nin terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics,\nwhat does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually\nwant them to be strong in the way we understand\nstrong, not just in every way. So that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. - Yep. - It's interesting, this is one of those\ntruths where you just speak and it resonates, and I\ndidn't even think about it. - [Marc] Yeah, exactly. - So you were sitting\nduring the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that said-\n- Yeah. - There's still to use\nsome good to the H-1B? - Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's- - Come all the way around. (laughs) - There's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance,\nwhich is mostly the valley, we don't use H-1Bs anymore,\nmostly we use O-1s. So there's a separate class of these, and the O-1 is like this, it turns out the O-1 is\nthe super genius visa. So the O-1 is the basically our founder, like when we have somebody\nfrom anywhere in the world and they've like invented a\nbreakthrough new technology, and they wanna come to\nthe US to start a company, they come in through an O-1 visa. And that actually is like\na, it's a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, but it's like a pretty high\nbar. And they do a lot of work and there's like a, you have\nto put real work into it and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened\nwith the H-1B visa program is that it has gone to\nbasically two categories of employers. One is the basically a small\nset of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies\nthat you would think. And then the other is, it goes to these, they call kind of the mills,\nthe consulting mills, right? And so there's these set\nof companies with names, I don't wanna pick on\ncompanies, but you know, names like Cognizant that, you know, hire, basically have their business model is bring in primarily\nIndians in large numbers, and you know, they often have, you know, offices next to company-owned housing. And they'll have, you know,\norganizations that are, you know, they'll have,\nyou know, organizations that are literally thousands\nof Indians, you know, living and working in the US and they do basically call it\nmid-tier, like IT consulting. So you know, these folks,\nthey're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a year or $100,000 a year, not the, you know, 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, like in practice, the startups, basic like\nlittle tech as we call it, or the startup world,\nmainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point and mainly can't, 'cause the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of\nunderlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, you know, Amazon, like Amazon's a\nin like I love Amazon, but like they're a big powerful company. You know, they've got, you\nknow, more money than God. They've got resources, they've got long-term\nplanning horizon, they do big, you know, profound things over,\nyou know, decades at a time. You know, they could, you know, or any of these other companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you know, you'll\nnotice they don't do that. You know, they bring in, you know, 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, like,\nthere's lots of questions around them and whether\nthey should, you know, whether that's even a\nethical way to, you know, I don't wanna say they're\nunethical, but there's questions around like exactly what\nthe trade-offs are there. Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, you know, nobody\nreally wanted to be opened, you know, to play devil's\nadvocate on all this in terms of like national\nimmigration issues, you know, none of this is like a top end issue just 'cause the numbers are small, right? And so, you know, I don't think, you know, the administration has said like, this is not like a priority\nof theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is like, there is actually a lot of\ncomplexity and nuance here. I have a lot of friends,\nlike I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues\nwho are, you know, who came over on H-1Bs,\nor O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens and you know, every single\none that one of them was not every single one, a lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the honor of immigrants throughout\nthis whole period. And they said to me,\nit's like, \"Well, Marc, you know, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance\nof high-skilled immigration to the US?\" And I was like, I think\nyou can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent and be like, do you\nwanna inflame the issue or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right? And I think the answer\nis to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one\nmore positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up\non the university some more. Do you know about the National\nMerit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? - Not really, can you explain? - So there's a system that was\ncreated during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when... It was when people in\ngovernment actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an ideas that sounds today. And so it's basically a\nnational talent search for basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify\nbasically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of\nother characteristics. So there's no race, gender,\nor any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory\nSAT that you take, and then the SAT. So it uses those scores,\nthat is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. So they use the SAT as a\nproxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to like 1% of\nthe population of the kids, 18 year olds any given year\nwho scored highest on the PSAT, and then they get down to\nlike further qualify down to the 0.5% that also\nreplicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right? So it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the\nbest and the brightest. How many of our great and\npowerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities\nall have sports teams, they all have national scouting,\nthey have full-time scouts who go out and they go\nto every high school and they try to find all\nthe great basketball players and bring them into the\nNCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities\nuse the National Merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids\nand just bring them in? - Let me guess, very few. Zero.\n- Zero. (laughs) - As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that\nsame level of scouting for talent internally. - Go get the smartest ones. I'll give you one more\nkicker on this topic if I haven't beaten it to death. You know, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a\nhighly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like\nthe whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the\ncollege board that runs it. And it has been essentially\nlike everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so the in two ways, number one, it's been dumbed down where\nan 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost\nimpossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, right? And so, it's been\ndeliberately dumbed down. And then two is they have tried to pull out a lot of what's\ncalled the g-loading. And so they've tried to detach\nit from being an IQ proxy 'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable, right? So the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has\nreally started to work. And one of the things you\nsee is the Asian spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is\nbecause it's more coachable now. And the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the coaching\nthing is really difficult 'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents\ncan afford coaching, right? And I don't know about\nyou, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT\nwas until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. So, number one, there's issues there, but the other issue there is\nthink about what's happened by the dumbing down,\n800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It's like the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they\nhave AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. 'Cause what you want\nis you want, whatever, if it's gonna be 100,000\nkids, I don't know what it is, it's gonna be 50,000\nkids a year scoring 800. You also then want kids\nto be able to score 900 and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200, and you wanna ultimately get to, you know, you'd like to ultimately\nidentify the top 100 kids and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the\ntest has been reduced, so that it actually is\nnot useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption that's taken place\nthroughout this entire system where we have been heading\nin the reverse direction from wanting to actually go\nget the best and brightest and actually put them in the\nplaces where they should be. And then just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System\nis it's comp, like I said, it's completely race\nblind, it's gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic. It's only done on test scores. You know, and you can make\nan argument about whether that's good or bad, but\nit is, you know, for sure, you know, it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed\nmerit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose\nto do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it like incredibly striking and an enormous moral\nindictment of the current system that there are no universities\nthat do this today. So back to the immigration\nthing, just real quick. It's like, okay, we aren't even trying\nto go get the smart kids out of the center of-\n- Yeah. - And even if they think that they can get into these\nplaces, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for\nthe smart Black people. And like, it's just like,\nI don't know how, like, I don't know how that's moral. Like I don't get it at all. - As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times and I've always gotten\nperfect on math, 800. And I'm not that I'm not special like, it doesn't identify genius. I think you wanna search for genius and you wanna create\nmeasures that find genius of all different kinds,\nspeaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and\nover, defend immigrants. Yes. But say we should hire\nmore and more native-born. - Well, you asked me in the beginning like what's the most optimistic\nforecast, right, that we could have? And the most optimistic\nforecast would be, my God, what if we did both? (laughs) - So that's the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. - Well, it would diffuse the entire issue. - [Lex] Yeah. - If everybody in the center\nin the South of the country and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they\nwere getting a fair shake, like it would diffuse the issue. Like how about diffusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical... Sorry, I don't mean to really get out over my skis here, but- - I think your profile on X\nstates, \"It's time to build.\" It feels like 2025 is\na good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for\nanybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build\nsomething useful in the world or maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch\napps, services, whatever, ship software products. So maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? - So I mean, a big part\nof the answer I think is we're in the middle\nof a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking\nabout this on your show, but like AI coding, I mean,\nthis is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the investment of software. And I'm sure you, and you\nknow, we're involved in various of these companies, but\nyou know, these tools, you know, from a variety of companies are just like absolutely revolutionary and they're getting better by\nleaps and bounds every day. And you know, all this, but like the thing with coding, like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever. But like for sure, we\ncan make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate\nthe results of coding. And so, you know, there's all\nthese methods of, you know, synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is gonna get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean\nanybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and\nlook at AI coding demos, you know, little kids\nmaking apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. I mean I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary. You know, in a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain\nyourself, you know, start using these things, get\na huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more\nquickly than you could before. - That's actually a tricky\none in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like\nyou still need to learn how to code, it becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately\nbe a one person company and get quite far. - I agree with that, up to a point. So I think, for sure,\nfor quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are gonna be the best at\nactually having AI's code things, 'cause they're gonna understand\nwhat I mean, very basic. They're gonna understand\nwhat's happening, right? And they're gonna be able\nbe able to evaluate the work and they're gonna be able to, you know, literally like manage AIs better. Like even if they're not\nliterally handwriting the code, they're just gonna have\na much better sense of what's going on. So I definitely think\nlike 100% my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds of coding classes, and he'll keep doing that\nfor certainly through 18. We'll see after that. And so like for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you\ncan do with an AI is say, teach me how to code, right? And you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, I'll name names,\nyou know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing at\nKhan Academy for free. And then we, you know, we\nhave this company, Replit, which is was originally\nspecifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that's just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this and yeah, that, I mean, the\nAI's gonna be able to teach you to code, AI, by the way, is as you know, spectacularly good at\nexplaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools\nhave these features now where you can talk to the code base and so you can like literally like ask the code base\nquestions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and\npaste code into ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it\nwhat's going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so yeah, there's\ndozens of ways to do this. By the way, you can also, I mean even more broadly than code. Like, okay, you wanna make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art\ngeneration, sound generation, dialogue generation,\nvoice generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like,\nyou don't need designers, you know, you don't need, you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then, you know, a big is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's interfacing\ninto other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments\nor something like that. And, you know, AI's fantastic\nat writing glue code. So, you know, really,\nreally good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you\nfigure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write\na business plan for you. So it's just this, it's\nlike everything happening with AI right now, it's just, it's like this latent superpower and there's this incredible\nspectrum of people who have really figured out\nmassive performance increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't\neven aware it's happening. And there's some gearing to\nwhether you're a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races. And I think there are lots\nof professional coders who are still like, eh... You know, the blacksmiths were\nnot necessarily in favor of, you know, the car business. So yeah, there's the old\nWilliam Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just\nnot evenly distributed yet.\" And this is maybe the most\npotent version of that that I've ever seen. - Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" - Right.\n- It is very common. The programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true. I consider myself\nreasonably good programmer, and my productivity has\nbeen just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming\nis more efficient, more productive, more fun,\nall that kind of stuff. - I would also say code is, you know, code has of anything in\nlike industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the\neasier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's\nunlimited demand for code. Like, in other words, like\nthere's always some other idea for a thing that you can do,\na feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, like overwhelmingly, you know, the amount of code that\nexists in the world is a fraction of even\nthe ideas we have today. And then we come up with\nnew ideas all the time. And so I think that\nlike, (laughs) you know, I was in the late '80s, early '90s, when sort of automated\ncoding systems started to come out, expert systems,\na big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called the \"Decline and Fall of the\nAmerican Programmer,\" you know, that predicted that\nthese new coding systems were gonna mean we wouldn't\nhave programmers in the future. And of course, the number\nof programming jobs exploded by like a factor of 100. Like, my guess is we'll have\nmore coding jobs probably by like an order magnitude\n10 years from now. That will be different,\nthey'll be different jobs. They'll involve orchestrating\nAI, but there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry\nwill just explode in size. - Are you seeing the size\nof companies decrease in terms of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? - All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. - [Lex] Oh, for the big tech? - And little tech.\n- And little tech. - Everybody's trying to\nhire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it's 100%. I mean, there's a handful\nof company, you know, there's a little bit,\nthere's customer service, you know, we have some\ncompanies and others 'cause I think it's\nKlarna that's publicizing a lot of this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. But like for engineering jobs, like, it's just an explosion of hiring that at least, so far, there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am\nlooking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first\ncompany to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. So basically, the companies that we see are\nbasically one of two kinds. We see the companies that are basically sometimes\nuse weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies,\nI sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point\non whatever they're doing. - (laughs) Sure. - Right? And it's on the slide, right?\n- Yeah. - So they've got the, you know, whatever, da, da, da, da, da, and then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is, 'cause they had already\npreviously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the\nsix bullet point in the slide, which is how you're\ngetting all these products that have like the AI button\nup in the corner, right? The little sparkly button. - Yep.\n- Right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which\nI'm like, I don't need that. Like, I need you to answer\nmy email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay, so we see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then we see the strong\nform, which is the companies that are building from\nscratch for AI, right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally\nan AI email system, as an example, so just- - Oh, nice. I can't wait. - Yeah, they're gonna completely. So the very obvious idea,\nvery smart team, you know, it's gonna be great. And then, you know,\nNotion, just, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a\nproduct. And so now companies are gonna basically come through, sweep through, and they're gonna do\nbasically AI-first versions of basically everything. And those are like\ncompanies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. - Yeah, Cursor is an example of that. They basically said, okay,\nwe're gonna rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. - What if we knew from scratch\nthat we could build on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the Full Employment Act\nfor startups and VCs is, it just like if a\ntechnology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development\nprocess over from scratch, 'cause you need to\nreconceptualize the product, and then usually what that\nmeans is you need a new company 'cause most incumbents just won't do that. And so, yeah. So that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for is the\ncompany where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned\nas a result of AI, right? So I'm looking at, I'm\nwaiting for the company where it's like, no, we're\ngonna have, like, you know, and the cliche, here's a\nthought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're gonna have like the human executive team, and then we're gonna have the\ntheis be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of engineering\nsupervising 100 instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right by the way, or maybe the VP of\nengineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs, right? 'Cause one of the things that\nAI should be pretty good at is managing 'cause it's\nlike not, you know, it's like a process-driven,\nit's the kind of thing that AI's actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so should it be an AI executive team? You know, and then, of\ncourse, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, right? You know, and then maybe\nthe most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set\none of these things loose and let it basically\nbuild itself a business? And so I will say like\nwe're not yet seeing those, and I think there's a little bit of, the systems aren't quite\nready for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, like a founder who's really willing to break all the rules and\nreally willing to take the swing. And those people exist, and\nso I'm sure we'll see that. - And some of it is, as you\nknow, with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have\na AI-first email client, seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail\nis really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google\ncan't do it, because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer\nthe entirety of the system. 'Cause feels like Google's\nperfectly positioned to do it. Same with like, you have\nPerplexity, which I love, like Google could technically\ntake on Perplexity and do it much better,\nbut they haven't, not yet. So it's fascinating why\nthat is for large companies. I mean that is an\nadvantage for little tech, they could be agile. - Yeah, that's right.\n- They can move fast. - Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can't-\n- Right. - This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in\n\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which is sometimes when big\ncompanies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too much glass. It would specifically, it would interfere with\ntheir existing customers and their existing businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly,\nthey shouldn't do that, right? And so they just get, this is Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they're well-run, not\nbecause they're poorly run. But they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing against\nthe existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Like every once in a while, one breaks the pattern\nand actually does it. But for the most part, like this is a very predictable\nform of human behavior, and this fundamentally\nis why startups exist. - It feels like 2025 is\nwhen the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. Like, it's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI. Who do you think wins the AI race? - I would say, I'm not gonna predict, I'm gonna say there's\nquestions all over the place. And then we have this\ncategory question we call the trillion-dollar\nquestion, which is like, literally depending on how it's answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there's like, I don't know, 5 or $6 trillion questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I'll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small models. Another is open models\nversus closed models. Another is whether you can\nuse synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political\ntrillion-dollar questions. You know, policy\nquestions, which, you know, the US and the EU have both\nbeen flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is\nabout to really succeed at. Yeah, and then there's\nprobably another, you know, half dozen big important\nquestions after that. And so these are all just\nlike, say, this is an industry that's in flux in a way\nthat I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious\nexample of the flux is you know, sitting here\nless than three years ago, sitting here in December of '22, we would've said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today,\nit's like, you know, there's at least six, you know, world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of\nthe most shocking things to me, is like, it turns out that once\nyou know that it's possible to build one incredibly\nsmart Turning-test-passing large language model,\nwhich was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it\nturns out within, you know, a year, you can have five more. There's also a money\ncomponent thing to it, which is to get the money\nto scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There's basically right now\nonly two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers\ngiving you the money, which you turn around and\nroundtrip back to them. Or, you know, foreign\nsovereigns, other, you know, country sovereign wealth\nfunds, which can be, you know, difficult in some\ncases, for companies to access. So there's maybe another\ntrillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here's one. So Sam Altman has been\npublic about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a nonprofit,\nbeing a for-profit. The way that is legally done is that, and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and and other legal entities, government entities,\nscrutinizes very carefully, 'cause the US takes foundation\nnonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so the way that historically, the way that you do it\nis you start a for-profit and then you raise money\nwith the for-profit to buy the assets of the\nnonprofit at fair market value. And, you know, the last\nfinancing round at OpenAI was, you know, 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the\nflip is going to happen, the for-profit has to\ngo raise $150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. You know, raising 150\nbillion is a challenge. So, you know, is that even possible? If that is possible, then\nOpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, you know, I don't know. And then, you know,\nobviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the\nmarket leader today, you know, there's big important questions there. You know, Microsoft has this\nkind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind, but you know, they're\nvery good at catching up. Amazon, you know, is\nprimarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. - And then there's the other questions, like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly,\nopen versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. And then test on compute\nwith chain of thought. They're all of that. And it's just fascinating. And these are, I think it's fair to say,\ntrillion-dollar questions. - Yeah, these are big, like\nlook, you know, it's like, okay, here's a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations, right? Like, so if you are trying to\nuse these tools creatively, you're thrilled because\nthey can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this\nincredible stuff, right? They're creative. The flip side of that is if\nyou need them to be correct, they can't be creative. And that's, you know,\nthe term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And you know, there have been,\nyou know, court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court\ncitations, case citations. The judge is like, \"Wait a\nminute, this doesn't exist.\" And the very next is, \"Did\nyou write this yourself?\" And the lawyer goes, \"Er-\" (laughs) - I mean that's why with Elon, with Grok-\n- Yes. - Looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? - Yeah, that's right. And my sense is this very\ncontentious topic at the industry, my sense is if to the extent that there is a domain in\nwhich there is a definitive and checkable provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to\ngenerate synthetic data. You should be able to do\nchain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do\nreinforcement learning, and you should be able\nto ultimately, you know, eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that's a trillion-dollar\nquestion right there as to whether that's true. But then there's question of like, okay, is that gonna work in\nthe more general domain? Like, so for example, one\npossibility is these things are gonna get truly superhuman\nlike math and coding. But at like discussing\nphilosophy, they're gonna just, they're basically as smart\nas they're ever gonna be. And they're gonna be kind of, you know, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they're already outta training data. Like they literally, if, you know, you talk to these people,\nlike literally the big models, the big models are like\nwithin a factor of 2X of consuming all the\nhuman-generated training data to the point that some of these big companies are\nliterally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean\nthat like you have to, if you want your model\nto better philosophy, you have to go hire like\na thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody gonna do that? And so, you know, maybe these things are\ntopping out in certain ways and they're gonna leap\nway ahead in other ways. And so anyway, so we just\ndon't, you know, this is... Actually, maybe my main\nmain conclusion is, anybody telling, you know, anybody telling you these\nbig sweeping conclusions, you know, this whole super, you know, all of these abstract\ngeneralized super intelligence AGI stuff like, you know, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like, that's to abstract like,\nit's gotta actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have\nto be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem\nright now with the, you know, the big models that are like\nreally good at coding and math, they're like actually very\nexpensive to run, you know, they're quite slow. Another trillion-dollar\nquestion, future chips, which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean, all the global issue. Oh, another trillion-dollar\nquestion censorship, right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly, what are you\ntraining these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long did they give you these... How often do they give you these incredibly preaching moral lectures? Here's a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries\nwant their country to run its education system,\nhealthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing\nCalifornia politics, right? 'Cause that's kind of what\nthey have on offer right now. And I think the answer\nto that is not very many. So there's like massive\nopen questions there about like what, you know, and by\nthe way, like what morality of these things are gonna\nget trained on as a- - And that one we're cracking wide open with what's been happening\nover the past few months. Censorship on every\nlevel of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to be expand\nthe Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. - So what I experienced,\nyou know, going back to how we started, what I\nexperienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at like large scale, and then the war on the crypto\nindustry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared\nintent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under\nthe same kind of censorship and control regime as\nsocial media and the banks. And I think this election\ntipped, in America, I think this election\ntipped us from a timeline in which things were going to\nget really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are gonna be quite good. But look, those same questions\nalso apply outside the US and you know, the EU is doing their thing, they're being extremely draconian and they're trying to lock in\na political censorship regime on AI right now that's so harsh that even American AI\ncompanies are not even willing to launch new products\nin the EU right now. Like, that's not gonna last, but like, what happens there, right? And what are the trade-offs? You know, what levels of censorship are American companies\ngonna have to sign up for if they wanna operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them,\n(laughs) so that they can't? So big questions. - Quick questions. So you're very active on X. A very unique character, flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a meme, I\ndon't remember it exactly, but that Elon posted\nsomething like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I\nthink, you know, doing the, I take a big step back and\nfuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside\nyour mind when you're tweeting? - To be clear, a reference from the comedy\nclassic \"Tropic Thunder.\" - \"Tropic Thunder,\" yeah. Legendary movie. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Any Zoomers listening\nto this who haven't seen that movie, go watch it immediately. - Yeah, there's nothing\noffensive about it. - Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise's greatest performance. (Lex laughing) So-\n- Yeah. - Yeah, no, look, I should\nstart by saying like, I'm not supposed to be\ntweeting at all, so- - Yeah.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So, but, you know. - So how do you approach that? Like how do you approach what to tweet? - I mean, I don't. I don't well enough. It's mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there's a glory to it and there's an issue with it,\nand the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global\ncommunication, you know, X in particular is, you know, the town square on all these,\nyou know, social issues, political issues, everything\nelse, current events. But I mean, look, there's\nno question of the format. The format of at least\nthe original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I was tweeted something. It turned out that it's\nstill politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news\nin each time zone in India for a single tweet. So like, the single tweet outta context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously, X now has the\nmiddle ground where they, you know, they now have\nthe longer form essays. And so, you know, probably\nthe most productive thing I can do is longer form things. - You're not gonna do it though, are you? - [Marc] I do, I do,\nfrom time-to-time. I do. - Sometimes.\n- I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean,\nlook, but, and yeah, and obviously, X is doing great. And then, like I said,\nlike Substack, you know, has become the center for a\nlot, you know, a lot of the, I think the best kind of,\nyou know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly\nintellectual content, you know, tons of current events\nstuff there as well. And then, yeah, so, and then there's a bunch\nof other, you know, a bunch of new systems\nthat are very exciting. So I think one of the\nthings we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive\nreinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen with that. And it's happened on X, but it's now gonna happen\non other platforms. And then the other is crypto's gonna come right back to life. And actually that's\nvery exciting, actually, that's worth noting is that's another\ntrillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal\neconomic system for that, right? 'Cause it's a programmable money, it's a very easy way\nto plug in and do that. And there's this transaction\nprocessing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto\nAI intersection, you know, is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was gonna be\nimpossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do. - Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite\nthings about Yann LeCun? (Marc laughing) I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree\non a lot of things, but I personally like\nvigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the\ngladiators go at it, and- - No, he's a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn't\nsay we're super close, but you know, casual friends. I worked with him at Meta, you know, he is the chief scientist\nat Meta for a long time and is still, you know, works with us. And obviously is a legendary\nfigure in the field and one of the main people\nresponsible for what's happening. My serious observation would be that it's the thing I keep,\nI've talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does\nis he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree\nwith this, he is the smartest and most credible critic\nof LLMs is the path for AI. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's not, you know, there's certain, I would say troll-like characters who are just like crapping everything. But like Yann has like very\ndeeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. And I actually, like,\nI try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,\nI try to have a mental model of like the two different\nsides of a serious argument. And so I've tried to like\ninternalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult 'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like\nthat could be a big problem. But like, we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the\nbullish people, you know, to really kind of test\ntheir level of knowledge. So I like to kind of grill people. Like, you know, I was got\nmy CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like to the extent I can\nunderstand Yann's points, I can use them to, you know,\nto really surface a lot of the questions for the\npeople who are more bullish. And that's been, I think,\nvery, very productive. Yeah, just, and it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, who is actually like a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he\nwill provoke the evolution of these systems to be much\nbetter than they would've been. - Yeah, he could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the\nLLM path to AGI, you know, his basic notions that\nthere needs AI needs to have some physical understanding\nof the physical world, and that's very difficult\nto achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations\nof LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source.\n- Yes. - Which is a whole nother-\n- Yes. - Which you have been as well. - [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah. - And that's been just\nfascinating to watch. - [Marc] And anti-doomer. - Anti-doomer?\n- Yeah. - Yeah, he's-\n- He's very anti-doomer. - He embodies... He also has many wolves inside. - [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes, he does. Yes, does. - So it's been really,\nreally fun to watch. - The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. - [Lex] Yeah. - The other two of the\nthree godfathers of AI are like radicals, like full-on left, you know,\nfar left, you know, like, I would say like either\nMarxists or borderline Marxists. And they're like, I think, quite extreme in\ntheir social political views. And I think that feeds\ninto their doomerism, and I think, you know, they are lobbying for\nlike draconian government, I think what would be ruinously\ndestructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Yann as a\ncounterpoint to those two. - Another fun question, our\nmutual friend Andrew Huberman. - [Marc] Yes. - First maybe, what do you\nlove most about Andrew? And second, what score\non a scale of 1 to 10 do you think he would give you\non your approach to health? - Oh, three. - Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.\n- (laughs) Exactly. - That's good. (laughs)\n- Exactly. Well, so he convinced me\nto stop drinking alcohol, which was a big-\n- Successfully? - Well, it was like other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world.\n- Yeah. - And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night, it was like a major, like, it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly\nnegatively impacted my emotional health. (Lex laughing) I blame him-\n- Yeah. - For making me much\nless happy as a person. But much, much, much healthier. - Yeah.\n- Physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have no interest in\nhis sleep shit. Like, no. This whole light, natural light, no, we're not doing it. - You're too hardcore for this? - I don't see any natural light in here. - [Lex] It's all covered. It's all horrible. - And I'm very happy. I would be very happy\nliving and working here 'cause I'm totally happy\nwithout natural light. - In darkness.\n- Yes. - It must be a metaphor for something. - Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have\na blue screen in your face for three hours and\nthen go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why you should wanna take shortcuts. - I now understand what they\nmean by toxic masculinity. All right. (both laughing) So let's see. You're exceptionally\nsuccessful by most measures, but what to you is the\ndefinition of success? - I would probably say it is\na combination of two things, I think it is contribution. So, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately, you know, and specifically\nit mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not\nmean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said, \"Pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to\nsatisfaction or fulfillment. And so I think about happiness as the first ice cream\ncone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice\ncream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of\nthe walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Right, and so happiness is\nthis very fleeting concept, and the people who\nanchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I dunno how to put it useful. - So that's a good place\nto arrive at in life. - Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah. You know, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But like, if you're sitting in a room by yourself and you're like, all right. Or you know, four in the\nmorning, it's like, all right, have I lived up to my\nexpectation of myself? Like if you have, you know,\nthe people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and, you know, generally seem\nvery, I dunno how to put it, pleased with, you know,\nproud, calm, at peace. The people who are, you\nknow, sensation seekers, you know, some of the sensations\nby the way, some sense, you know, there's certain\nentrepreneurs, for example, who are like into every\nform of extreme sport and they get, you know, huge\nsatisfaction out of that. Or, you know, there's sensation seeking in sort of useful and productive ways. You know, Larry Ellison\nwas always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, there's\na lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know,\ndrugs, (laughs) you know, like you know, sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun\nat first and then backfire. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM- - [Marc] Yeah.\n- And I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM- - Yeah.\n- With a blue screen. - That's good. Exactly. - Staring at cursor.\n- Exactly. - As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an\namazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and\njust to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called,\n\"Honestly, with Bari Weiss.\" She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys... See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. - [Marc] Thank you. - So this question is designed for many of the questions today\nwere designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause\nthat you're not sure. So it felt like the\npause, the uncertainty, there was some kind of\nongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching\nfor wisdom and meaning? - I guess I'd put it this way. There's a lot to just\nunderstand about people that I feel like I'm only\nstarting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler\nconcept than God. (laughs) So that's what I've spent a\nlot of the last, you know, 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my\nfirst like whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I'm spending 30\nyears figuring out people, which turns out to be quite\na bit more complicated. And then, I don't know,\nmaybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look,\nI mean just, you know, like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is like\nvery, you know, complicated and, you know, mystifying. I mean, every time I, you\nknow, pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, you know, \"Daddy, how many galaxies\nare there in the universe?\" And you know, how many galaxies are\nthere in the universe? - 100 billion?\n- Okay. Like how? (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - Like-\n- Yeah. - Like how that freaking possible? Like it's such a\nstaggering concept that I- - I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from\nElon from a while back. Elon, said, \"As a friend called it, this\nis the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies, a billion light years across.\"\n- Yeah. - So these are all galaxies.\n- Yeah. Like how was it that big? Like how the hell, and like, you know, I can read the textbook\nand the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion\nyears and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all\nrights, the Big Bang. All right, like what was\nbefore the Big Bang? (laughs) - Do you think we humans will\never colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? - Sure. Yeah, I mean,\nin the fullness of time. Yeah. - So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across a thousand of-\n- In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah, you know, all the problem, all the\nchallenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it'll take a long time. - You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? - No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately\nwe have Elon giving us, (Lex laughing) giving us the backup plan. So I don't know, like,\nI grew up, you know, real Midwest, sort of\njust like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an\nengineer and a scientist. I'm like, \"Oh, that definitely\ndoesn't make sense.\" I'm like, \"I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll figure everything out.\" And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against\nthese things, you know, you bump up against these things and you're just like, \"All right,\" I like, \"Okay, I guess there's\na scientific explanation for this, but like, wow.\" And then there's like, \"All right, where did that come from?\" Right, and then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean,\nand even just, you know, experiences that we all have on earth, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, I guess I just say I'm kind\nof radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that\nI'll probably never know. The other thing though, that's happened, and maybe the more practical\nanswer to the question is I think I have a much\nbetter understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great... I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, \"If a man does\nnot have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\" And so there's this class,\nit's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing\npoint of view, which is, \"Yes, I'm an atheist,\nbut it's very important that the people believe in something.\" Right? And Marx had like the\nnegative view on that, which is religions the\nopiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like\nright-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it's deeply important that the people be Christian\nor something like that. And on the one hand it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right because, you know, what have we learned in the last 100 years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's\nthis political philosopher who's super interesting on\nthis named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the sort\nof mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was like born in, I think, like 1900, and like died in like '85. So he saw the complete run\nof communism and Nazism and himself, you know, I think he fled Europe and\nyou know, the whole thing. And you know, his sort of\nbig conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but like in the deep way of religions. Like, you know, we call\n'em political religions, but they were like actual religions. And you know, they were\nwhat Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, \"God is dead. We've killed him, and we won't\nwash the blood off our hands for 1,000 years,\" right? Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just\nmass murder and death. And like, you read his stuff now and you're like, \"Yep,\n(laughs) that happened.\" Right? And then, of\ncourse, as fully, you know, elite moderates, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing\nthat for ourselves right now, but of course, we are. And you know, I would argue\nthat Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the\nlast 10 years, you know, we have been in a\nreligious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full\nscale religious frenzy and has had all of the\ncharacteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to, you know, sin. Wokeness has said, every, I think, has said every single aspect of an actual religion other\nthan redemption, right? Which is maybe like the\nmost dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's\nno forgiveness, right? And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would've\nzeroed right in on that, would've said that. And, you know, we just\nlike sailed right off. I mentioned earlier like\nwe somehow rediscovered the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity\npolitics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, like there is\nsomething very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and\nneeds to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles\nwith the specifics of it. - I think I speak for a lot of people that it's been a real joy and for me, an honor to get to\nwatch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You're in that 30-year part of your life, and it's been an honor\nto talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That's only, how long is that? - Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so- - I'll accept being one of the short ones. (both laughing) - For the listener. Marc looks like he's ready\nto go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. (laughs) Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen.

Marc is a visionary\ntech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the\ntech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential\nvoices in the tech world, including at the intersection\nof technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the\nbest possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small\ntech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario\ntrajectory for America. - The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.\n- The roaring '20s. I mean, look, couple things. It is remarkable over\nthe last several years with all of the issues\nincluding, you know, not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every\nother thing that's happened. It's really amazing, the United\nStates just kept growing. If you just look at\neconomic growth charts, the US just kept growing,\nand very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing,\nGermany has stopped growing, and you know, some of those countries may be actually growing\nbackwards at this point. And there's a very long\ndiscussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's of course, plenty of things that are\nwrong with our country, but the US is just flat\nout primed for growth. And I think that's a consequence\nof many factors, you know, some of which are lucky and\nsome of which through hard work. And so the lucky part is\njust, you know, number one, you know, we just have like\nincredible physical security by being our own continent. You know, we have incredible\nnatural resources, right? There's this running joke now that like, whenever it looks like\nthe US is gonna run out of some like rare earth\nmaterial, you know, some farmer in North Dakota\nlike kicks over a hay bale and finds like a $2 trillion deposit. Right, I mean, we're just like blessed, you know, with geography\nand with natural resources. Energy. You know, we can be energy\nindependent anytime we want. This last administration\ndecided they didn't wanna be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has\ndeclared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There's no question we\ncan be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It's purely a question of choice, and I think the new\nadministration's gonna do that. And oh, and then I would\nsay two other things. One is, you know, we\nare the beneficiaries, and, you know, you're an example of this. We're a beneficiary. We're the beneficiary of,\nyou know, 50, 100, 200 years of like the basically\nmost aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people, you know, moving to the US and\nraising their kids here. And so we just have, you know, we're by far the\nmost dynamic population, most aggressive. You know, we're the most\naggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country, and have been for a long\ntime, and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the\nadvanced technology leader. You know, we have our\nissues and we have a... I would say particular\nissue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for, you know, anything\nin software, anything in AI, anything in, you know,\nall these, you know, advanced biotech, all these\nadvanced areas of technology, like we're by far the leader. Again, in part 'cause many\nof the best scientists and engineers in those fields, you know, come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for a just a monster boom. You know, I could see\neconomic growth going way up. I could see productivity\ngrowth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a\nglobal tour, if you like, but like, basically, all of our competitors\nhave like profound issues and, you know, we could kind\nof go through them one by one, but the competitive\nlandscape just is, it's like, it's remarkable how much better positioned\nwe are for growth. - What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical questions. You know, I travel across the world and there's something\nabout the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be\nthe Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? - Yeah. So is this a family\nshow or am I allowed to swear? - You could say whatever\nthe fuck you want. - (laughs) Okay. So the great TV show, \"Succession,\" the show, of course, which\nyou were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.\n- Yes. - The best line from \"Succession\"\nwas in the final episode of the first season\nwhen the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral\nhomeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle,\nyou know, for some wedding. And Logan is just like\ncompletely miserable, have to having to, you know, 'cause he is been in\nNew York for 50 years, he's totally miserable\nbeing back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here and go back to America where\nwe can fuck without condoms.\" (both laughing) - Was that a metaphor or... Okay.\n- Exactly. Right. And so no, but it's exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what, like-\n- Yeah. - Everybody watching that\ninstantly starts laughing 'cause you know what it means,\nwhich it's exactly this. I think there's like an\nethnographic, you know, way of it. There's a bunch of\nbooks on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all\nthe different derivations of all the different ethnic\ngroups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. Right, and what we have is\nthis sort of amalgamation of like, you know, the\nNortheast, you know, Yankees who are like super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are\nsuper aggressive, you know, we've got the, you know, the Southerners and the Texans, you know, and you know, the sort of, you\nknow, whole kind of blended, you know, kind of\nAnglo-Hispanic thing, you know, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, you know, capable characters. You know, the Texas Rangers,\nyou know, we've got the, yeah, we've got the California, you\nknow, we've got the, you know, the wild, we've got the\nincredibly, you know, inventive hippies, but we also\nhave the hardcore engineers. We've got, you know, the best, you know, rocket scientists in the world. We've got the best, you\nknow, artists in the world, you know, creative professionals,\nyou know, the best movies. And so yeah, there is, you know, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, you\nknow, in my view to some extent, you know, attempts to\nbasically sand all that off and make everything basically\nboring and mediocre. But there is something\nin the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just\nneed people to stand up at a certain point and say, you know, \"It's time to build, it's time to grow, you know,\nit's time to do things.\" And there's something\nin the American spirit that just like roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I actually saw, you know, I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s, you know, 'cause the '70s were like horribly depressing, right? In the US. Like they were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has\nfelt a lot like the '70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating,\nyou know, negative attitude and everybody's upset about everything. And, you know, and then by\nthe way, like energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization, right? You know, the low point for\nin the '70s was, you know, Jimmy Carter who just passed away. He went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech. And it was like the weakest possible, trying to like rouse people\nback to a sense of like passion, he completely failed. And, you\nknow, we had the, you know, the hostages in, you know,\nIran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly\nnews, it was, you know, lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then, you know, Reagan came in and, you know, Reagan was a\nvery controversial character at the time, and, you know, he came in\nand he is like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're gonna do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and, you know, roared really\nhard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what... I think, you know, we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. - And I just did a super long\npodcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible\nprofessor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic.\n- Yes. - And one of which maybe\nyou can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual\nfreedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just\nin general, individualism. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and as you know this, America has this incredible\nstreak of individualism, you know, individualism in\nAmerica probably peaked, I think between roughly call\nit the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably\ncall it 1931 or something, you know, and there was\nthis like incredible rush. I mean, that period, you know, we now know that period as the\nSecond Industrial Revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then, you know, that led to, you know, ultimately then therefore\nbeing able to, you know, not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II\nand then win the Cold War. And yeah, you know, massive\nindividualistic streak. By the way, you know,\nMilton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring.\n- Yep. - As they were then, you know, he is a singular figure and many of us, you\nknow, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of\npeople who worked with him and you know, he was a singular figure, but all of his lessons, you know, live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's\nnot just individualism, and this is, you know, this\nis one of the big things, it's like playing out\nin a lot of our culture and kind of political fights\nright now, which is, you know, basically this feeling, you\nknow, certainly that I have and I share with a lot\nof people, which is, it's not enough for America\nto just be an economic zone. And it's not enough for\nus to just be individuals, and it's not enough to\njust have line go up, and it's not enough to\njust have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also, you know,\nthere's more to a country than just that. And you know, quite frankly,\na lot of it is intangible. A lot of it is, you know,\ninvolve spirit and passion. And you know, like I said, we have more of it than\nanybody else, but, you know, we have to choose to want it. The way I look at, it's\nlike all of our problems are self-inflicted. Like, you know, decline is a choice. You know, all of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, you know, basically people telling us, people in positions of\nauthority telling us that, you know, \"We shouldn't,\nyou know, stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous,\nwe shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, you know, we shouldn't this,\nthat, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about\neverything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think\npeople are done with it. - If we could go on a\ntangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book \"The Ancient City.\"\n- Yes. - By, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa\nDenis Fustel de Coulanges, I don't know. - That was amazing. - Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said, this is an\nimportant book to understand who we are and where we come from. - So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by\nthis guy as a (indistinct). I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language\npronunciations for the day. He was a professor classics\nat the Sorbonne in Paris, you know, the top university,\nactually in the 1860s, so actually, right around\nafter the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a\nparticular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the\nbook as he had apparently read, and, you know, sort of absorbed and memorized every\npossible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about\nGreek and Roman culture, and that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none\nof that has changed, right? And so he had access to the\nexact same written materials that we have access to, and you know, we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he\ndid is he went back further. He reconstructed the people\nwho came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their\nlife and society was like. And these were the\npeople who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you\nmay have heard of these are the people who came\ndown from the steppes. And so they came out of what's\nnow like Eastern Europe, like around sort of the\noutskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of\nswept through Europe. They ultimately took over\nall of Europe, by the way, you know, almost many of the\nethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years\nthat follow, you know, are Indo-European. And so like, you know, they were this basically this warrior, basically class that like\ncame down and swept through and you know, essentially, you know, populated much of the world. And there's a whole\ninteresting saga there. But what he does, and then they basically, from there came basically\nwhat we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind\nof evolutions off of that. And so what he reconstructs\na sort of what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind\nof original social state. And the significance of that\nis the original social state is this is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no\ntechnology, (laughs) right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got the clothes on your back, you've got your, you know, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you know, predates\nbasically all concepts of technologies as we\nunderstand 'em today. And so these are people\nunder like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social\npatterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern\nbasically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero\nconcept of individual rights and essentially no\nconcept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set\nof tribes would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what\nNietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality,\nanything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it's very clear why that is, right? It's 'cause strong equals\ngood equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is it more important\nfor you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, you know, live as a slave on your\nknees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted\nthat moral framework. But it, you know, the\noriginal framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally\nobligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. (laughs) Right, you were morally required to. Like, if you didn't do\nit, you were a bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time\nwith no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives\nis that it's a collective you know, and people are\nsharing and of course, that limited how big they could get 'cause you know, the\nproblem with communism is it doesn't scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it\nwork at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately\ntied into their religion. And their religion was,\nit was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors\nis extremely important because it was basically the\nancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the\npeople who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of nature 'cause of course, nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city\nhad their ancestor gods, and then they had their nature gods. Okay, so fast-forward to today, like we live in a world that\nis like radically different, and the book takes you\nthrough kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans, through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because\nthe conventional view of the progress through time\nis that we are, you know, the cliche is the arc of the\nmoral universe, you know, bend towards justice, right? Or so-called wig history,\nwhich is, you know, that the arc of progress\nis positive, right? And so, you know, what\nyou hear all the time, what you're taught in school\nand everything is, you know, every year that goes by,\nwe get better and better and more and more moral\nand more and more pure and a better version of ourselves, our Indo-European ancestors would say, \"Oh, no, like you people\nhave like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically your civilization, and you have diluted\nthem down to the point where they barely even matter. You know, and you're having, you know, children outta a wedlock and you're, you know, you\nregularly encounter people of other cities and you\ndon't try to kill them.\" And like, how crazy is that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an\nincredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious,\nhighly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can't resist noting\nthat as a consequence of basically going through\nall the transitions we've been through, going all the way through\nChristianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We're in a secular society,\nyou know, that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but you know, largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved,\nmodern secular, you know, expert, scientists and so\nforth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact\nsame religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had,\nspecifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics\nand nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, worked our way all the way\nback to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show\nthat like, you know, in some ways we have fallen\nfar from the family tree, but in some cases, we're exactly the same. - You kind of described this\nprogressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. - Identity politics is\nworshiping ancestors, right?\n- Yeah. - It's tagging newborn\ninfants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've\nrecognized it on sight. We somehow think it's like\nsuper socially progressive. - Yeah. And it is not. - I mean, I would say obviously not. You know, get nuanced, which\nis where I think you're headed, which is look like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent\nsociety every generation, and have no regard whatsoever\nfor what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea, right? That's like the Cambodians\nwith Year Zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up\neverything that came before and create something new\nin the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing, you know,\nenormous destruction. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, there is like a deeply\nimportant role for tradition. And the way I think\nabout that is the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And you know, this is what\nIndo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled\nwisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and\npowerful lessons learned. And that's why I think\nit's fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is 'cause that's part of the history and you know, part of the learning that got us to where we're today. Having said that, there are\nmany cultures around the world that are, you know, mired\nin tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that's the default human\ncondition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in\nsocieties in which, you know, there's like absolute\nseniority by age, you know, kids are completely... You know, like in the\nUS, like for some reason, we decided kids are in\ncharge of everything, right? And like, you know,\nthey're the trendsetters and they're allowed to\nlike, set all the agendas and like set all the politics\nand set all the culture and maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. 'Cause it's the old\npeople who are in charge of everything, you know,\nthey're gerontocracies, and it's all a bunch of\n80-year-olds running everything, which by the way, we have a\nlittle bit of that too, right? And so what I would say is like, there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is\ncommunitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you\nknow, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, I mean, it just\ndoesn't get you anywhere. Like, it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a society living\nin the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in\nall the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, you know, I think it probably, this is one of those things\nwhere extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. - So the beautiful picture you\npainted of the roaring '20s, how can the Trump\nadministration play a part in making that future happen? - Yeah, so look, a big part of this is getting the government\nboot off the neck of the American economy, the\nAmerican technology industry, the American people. You know, and again, this\nis a replay of what happened in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know, for what started out looking\nlike, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you\nknow, we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I describe as sort of a\nform of soft authoritarianism. You know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's not like, you know, you\nget thrown into Lubyanka. You know, for the most part, it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know,\nincredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vetocracy, right? What's required to get anything done? You know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything,\nany one of them can veto it. You know, there's a lot of (indistinct)\npolitical system works. And then, you know, just this\ngeneral idea of, you know, progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses\nis bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome,\nyou know, basically anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. Anybody who's wrong\nabout anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this\nvery kind of, you know, grinding repression. And then coupled with\nspecific government actions such as censorship regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, you know, critical American industries and then, you know,\ncongratulating yourselves on the back for doing it, or, you know, having these\nhorrible social policies, like let's let all the\ncriminals outta jail and see what happens, right? And so, like we've just\nbeen through this period, you know, I call it a\ndemoralization campaign. Like we've just been through\nthis period where, you know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being\nthis comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible\nand if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration\nreached kinda the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many\nfronts at the same time. And so just like relieving that and getting kind of back\nto a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic,\nconstructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind,\nthere's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is gonna, I think,\ncause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of\nthings proactively that, yeah. And then there's a lot\nof things proactively that could be done. - So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically\npermeated government and permeated big companies? - Disclaimer at first, which is I don't wanna predict\nanything on any of this stuff 'cause I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics\nor Washington at all. But I would just say that\nthe plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration\nand that they plan to take, you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're gonna do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they're gonna do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they're gonna move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. Like, I mean, you know, we just saw a great example\nof this with what, you know, with what Mark Zuckerberg\nis doing, you know, and obviously I'm\ninvolved with his company, but you know, we just saw it\nkind of in public, the scope, and speed of the changes, you know, are reflective of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry, right? And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump\nor anti-Trump, like, there's just like a giant vibe shift mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a\ngroup of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still, you know, people who at least vocally\nwere still very anti-Trump, but I said, you know, \"Has anything changed since November 6th?\" And they immediately said, \"Oh, it's completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. You know, woke is over.\" You know, they said that\nall kinds of projects are gonna be able to get\nmade now they couldn't before that, you know, Hollywood's gonna start\nmaking comedies again. You know, like, they were just, just like an incredible\nimmediate environmental change. And as I talk to people kind\nof throughout, you know, certainly throughout the economy,\npeople who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which\nis just this last 10 years of misery is just over. I mean, the one that I'm\nwatching that's really funny. I mean, Facebook's getting a lot, Meta's getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is\nBlackRock, which I'm not, you know, and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so, you know, the Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock was like first in as a major, you know, investment CEO on like\nevery dumb social trend and rule set, like every... All right, I'm going for it.\nEvery retardant, (laughs) every retarded thing you can imagine.\n- Yeah. - Every ESG and every, like, every possible saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed\nideological positions. And, you know, he was coming\nin, he literally was like, had a aggregated together\ntrillions of dollars of shareholdings that he did not, you know, that were his customer's rights. And he, you know, seized\ntheir voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been like backpedaling\nfrom that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example, last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, you know, he pulled out\nof the crazy energy stuff. And so, like, you know, he's\nbacking away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard\nPryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where\nhe could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (Lex laughing) (laughs) And so, you know,\neven there doing that, and just the whole thing, I mean this, I dunno if you saw the court\nrecently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of\ndirectors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel\nand I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional\nattorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight\nface that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who\nliterally wrote a book called \"The Diversity Myth.\"\n- Yeah. - And he literally looked\nlike he'd swallowed a live goldfish and that-\n- Yeah. - And this was imposed, I mean, this was like so\nincredibly offensive to him that like, it was just\nabsolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (Lex laughing) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange\nimposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that, you know, so like these things basically are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other\nside of it is basically, you know, finally being able\nto get back to, you know, everything that, you know,\neverybody always wanted to do, which is like, run their\ncompanies, have great products, have happy customers,\nyou know, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society. - It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. - Well, so it was very, you\nknow, there was a moment. So you know, Peter, of course, you know, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but you know, there are other\nmen on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it,\nand we're like, all right, like, okay, LGBT, and we keep\ncoming back to the B, right? And it's like- (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - You know, it's like-\n- All right. - You know, I'm willing to do\na lot for this company, but- (both laughing) - It's all about sacrifice for diversity. - Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay,\nlike is there a test? - Right.\n- Right. You know, so.\n(Lex laughing) - Oh, yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? - [Marc] The questions\nthat got asked, you know. - What are you willing to do-\n- Yeah, and- - The greater good? - I've become very good at asking lawyers\ncompletely absurd questions with a totally straight face. - And do they answer with a\nstraight face, like lawyers- - Sometimes.\n- Okay. - I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. - So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon\nValley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to\npreference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? Like what percent of them\nare feeling this vibe shift and are interested in\ncreating the roaring '20s in the way they've described? - So first, we should\nmaybe talk population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley and the way to just measure that is just look at\nvoting records, right? And what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically, my entire time there has\nbeen overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that\nis political donation records. And again, you know,\nthe political donations in the Valley, you know,\nrange from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. And so, you know, I just\nbring it up 'cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there\nis a very big question of what's happening in\nLos Angeles right now. I don't wanna get into the fire, but like, it's catastrophic. And, you know, there was\nalready a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people\nin LA are really thinking about things right now as\nthey're trying to, you know, literally save their houses\nand save their families. But, you know, even in San Francisco, you know, there was a big shift\nto the right in the voting in '24. So, we'll see where\nthat goes, but you know, you observe that by just looking\nat the numbers over time. The part that I'm more\nfocused on is, you know, and I don't know how to\nexactly describe this, but it's like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people, right? You know, and I don't have a list, but like, you know, it's\nall the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top\nengineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, you know, the people who kind of\nbuilt and run the companies. And they're, you know,\nI don't have numbers, but I have a much more\ntactile feel, you know, for what's happening. So the big thing I have\nnow come to believe is that the idea that people\nhave beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most\nhigh-status people just go along. And I think maybe the\nmost high-status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the\nmost focused on status. And the way I would\ndescribe that is, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the\nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely\ninteresting articulation. You know, he was an\ninsane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. (both laughing) But-\n- Shots fired, man. - But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing\nwhere he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that's just stuck in my\nmind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept, you just called over-socialization. And so, you know, most\npeople are socialized, like most people are, you\nknow, we live in a society, most people learn how\nto be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There's something about\nmodern Western elites where they're over-socialized and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, you know, think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little\nbit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence\nof where I grew up. Like even before I had the\nviews that I have today, there was always just this\nweird thing where it's like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree\non every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in The New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? (laughs) Right? But why does everybody like\nsnap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I\ncame to Silicon Valley, and it's just as true\ntoday 30 years later. And so I think most\npeople are just literally, I think they're taking their cues from, it's some combination of\nthe press, the universities, the big foundations. So basically, it's like\nThe New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and you know, I don't\nknow, you know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and you know, maybe the President if\nyour party is in power. And like, whatever that is, everybody who's sort of\ngood and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the\ntwo interesting things about that is, number one, there's no divergence among\nthe organs of power, right? So Harvard and Yale believed\nthe exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believed the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and\nthe Rockefeller Foundation believed the exact same thing. Google, and, you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believed the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there's never conflict\nin the moment, right? And so, you know, The New York Times and The Washington Post\nagreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the\nspecifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically, we in the valley, we're\non the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood's\non the tail end of that, in the same way New York's\non the tail end of that, the same way the media's\non the tail end of that. It's like some sort of\ncollective hive mind thing. And I just go through that to say like, I don't think most people in my orbit, or you know, let's say the top\n10,000 people in the Valley, or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're sitting\nthere thinking basically, I have rocks... I mean, they probably think\nthey have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core\nof rocks solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch\nreality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they\nconform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time, they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd. - Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that, there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking to\npeople really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens\nat the dinner parties? Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four\npeople who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the\nmind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention\nwithin New York Times with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that\novertook Marc Andreessen's face. - So look, I'll just\ntell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences,\nno, there's none of that. What there is that all of the\nheretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation is either\ndiscussed a one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real-life social network. There's a secret handshake,\nwhich is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like\nknow each other a little bit, but like not well. And like you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to\nthe other person openly or whether you have to\nlike be fully conformist. It's a joke. - Well, yeah, humor- - [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke.\n- Yep. - If the other person laughs,\nthe conversation is on. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - If the other person doesn't laugh, back slowly away from the scene, (laughs) I didn't mean anything by it. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then by the way, it\ndoesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke\nthat's just up against the edge of one of the, use the\nSam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. You know, it has to be up\nagainst one of the things, you know, one of the things\nthat you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point,\nwhat happens is you have a peer-to-peer network, right? You have a one-to-one\nconnection with somebody, and then you have your own, your little conspiracy\nof a thought criminality, and then you've probably\nbeen through this, you have your network\nof thought criminals, and then they have their\nnetwork of thought criminals, and then you have this\nlike delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together, right? - And the fundamental mechanism\nof the dance is humor. - Yeah, it's humor like it, right? Well, of course.\n- Memes. Yeah. - Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor's a way\nto have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss\nserious thing without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right? So that's part of it, which is one of the reasons\nwhy comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can't. 'Cause, you know, they\ncan always fall back on, oh, yeah, I was just going for the laugh.\n- Yeah. - But the other key\nthing about humor, right? Is that laughter's involuntary, right? Like, you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision whether you're gonna laugh. And everybody can tell when\nsomebody's fake laughing, right? And this, every professional\ncomedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something truthful. Like, people don't laugh at\nlike, made-up bullshit stories. They laugh 'cause like\nyou're revealing something that they either have not\nbeen allowed to think about or have not been allowed\nto talk about, right? Or is off limits. And all of a sudden,\nit's like the ice breaks and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny and like I laugh, and then, of course,\nthis is why, of course, live comedy is so powerful is 'cause you're all doing\nthat at the same time, so you start to have, you\nknow, the safety of numbers. And so the comedians have like the all, it's no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has\nbeen as successful as he has 'cause they have this\nhack that the, you know, the rest of us who are\nnot professional comedians don't have, but you have\nyour in-person version of it. Yeah, and then you've got the question of whether you can sort of\njoin the networks together. And then you've probably\nbeen to this is, you know, then at some point\nthere's like a different, there's like the alt dinner party, the (indistinct) dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are like the happiest\nmoments of everybody's lives, 'cause they're just like,\neverybody's just ecstatic, 'cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed, like for every third sentence that comes outta my mouth, and we can actually\ntalk about real things. So that's the live version of it. And then, of course, the other\nside of it's the, you know, the group chat phenomenon, right? And then basically the same\nthing played out, you know, until Elon bought X and until\nSubstack took off, you know, which were really the\ntwo big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute\nconformity on the social networks, like literally enforced by\nthe social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through\ncancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming, right? But then group chats grew\nup to be the equivalent of samizdat, right? Anybody who grew up in the\nSoviet Union under, you know, communism, note, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It is like, how do you\nknow who you could talk to? And then how do you\ndistribute information? And like, you know, again, that was the hard\nauthoritarian version of this. And then we've been living\nthrough this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, with\nsome of the same patterns. - And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient\nto build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. - Yeah, exactly. Well,\nand this is the thing, and well, this is kind of the running joke about groups, right? The running kind of\nthing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, every group chat, if you've noticed this like, this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up\nbeing about memes and humor. And the game of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable. - [Lex] Yeah. - As you can get without\nactually tripping it, right? And like literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest\nwhere, but it's walking, they walk right up the line\nand they're constantly testing. And every once in a while\nsomebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, \"Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, we gotta wait until\nnext year to talk about that.\" You know, they walk it back. And so it's that same thing, and yeah. And then group chats is a\ntechnological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. 'Cause basically, it was number one, it was, you know, obviously\nthe rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of\nthe new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination\nof WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is\nthose were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough, I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably\nfour or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages,\nI think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of the\ndisappearing messages, right? And so it's like, you know, I\noften get behind on my thing, so I set to seven-day, you\nknow, disappearing messages and my friends who, you know, are like, no, that's way too much risk. - Yeah.\n- It's gotta be a day. And then every once in a\nwhile somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something\nlike particularly inflammatory. - Yeah, 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that\nbothers me about WhatsApp, the choices between 24 hours\nand, you know, seven days, one day or seven days.\n- (laughs) Right. - And I have to have an existential crisis about deciding.\n- Yes. - Whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Now, of course,\nwhat's happening right now is the big thaw, right? And so the vibe shift. So what's happening on the\nother side of the election is, you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the\ncontinued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new\nplatforms that are emerging. You know, like I think\nit may be, you know, I don't know that everything\njust shifts back into public, but like a tremendous amount\nof the verboten conversations, you know, can now shifts\nback into public view. And I mean, quite frankly,\nthis is one of those things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those, you know, what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like\nnet better for society that those things happen in\npublic instead of private. You know, do you really want, like, yeah. Like does she wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it's just, look, it's just I think,\nclearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. - I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea\nthat we're talking about. I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction\nof people have that? To me, the preference falsification\nis really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? 'Cause like that the dynamical system that is the difference between\nthose two is fascinating. Like, throughout history, the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting, 'cause everybody was following, you know, the line until not.\n- Right. - But for sure, privately,\nthere was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where like this is the\nbureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really\nbothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden, there's a trigger that allows\nthe vibe shift to happen. To me, like the interesting\nquestion here is, what is the landscape of\nprivate thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how\nmuch dormant energy is there for this roaring '20s? What people are like, no more\nbullshit, let's get shit done. - Yeah, so we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- - [Lex] Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly, this is one\nof the all-time great books. Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book, but it's completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply\nhistorically informed. So it's called \"Private\nTruths, Public Lies.\" And it's written by a social science\nprofessor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his\na definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls preference falsification. And so preference\nfalsification is two things, preference falsification... And you get it from the title of the book, \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So preference falsification\nis when you believe something and you can't say it, or/and this is very important,\nyou don't believe something and you must say it, right? And the commonality there is\nin both cases, you're lying. You believe something internally, and then you're lying about it in public. And so the thing, you know, and there's sort of the\ntwo classic forms of it. There's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe\ncommunism is rotten, but I can't say it version of it. But then there's also the famous parable of the real-life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good\nbook on this topic, which is \"The Power of the Powerless,\" you know, who is an\nanti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the, you know, the president Czechoslovakia\nafter the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book, and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of\nthe world unite, right? And so he describes what he calls the parable of the greengrocer, which is your greengrocer\nin Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been... 50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your story that says, \"Workers of\nthe world, unite,\" right? And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear\nthat the workers of the world are not going to unite. (laughs) Like of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been\nat that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be\nin your window every morning, because if it's not in\nyour window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are gonna come by and they're gonna get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays\nin the window all day long. But he says, the thing\nis, every single person, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the slogan knows that it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the store knows that the greengrocer is\nonly putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to\ngo through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the\nsystem and lying in public. And so it turns into\ndemoralization campaign. In fact, it's not ideological\nenforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake, everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're\nenforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they are\nenforcing compliance, right? And compliance with the regime. And fuck you, you will comply, right? And so anyway, that's\nthe other side of that. And of course, we have\nlived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening\nto this could name a series of slogans that\nwe've all been forced to chant for the last decade, that everybody knows at\nthis point are just like, simply not true. I'll let the audience, you know, speculate on their own group chats. (both laughing) - Send Marc your memes\nonline as well, please. - Yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so anyway, so it's the\ntwo sides of that, right? So it's \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending\nthat from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire\nsociety experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages\nquestion, which is like, okay, what happens in a society\nin which people are forced to lie in public about\nwhat they truly believe? What happens number one\nis that individually they're lying in public, and that's bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have\nan accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how\nmany people agree with them. And this is how you, and\nagain, this literally is like how you get something\nlike the communist system, which is like, okay, you\nend up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be\nwilling to go along with it, but I'm not gonna be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the people who agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a\nmovement, you're gonna get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're gonna win the revolution, right? And so the question of like\nwhat the percentage actually is like a really critical question. And then, basically, in any\nsort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know\nuntil you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put at\nthe test in the same way. This is exactly what's happened\nfor the last two years, like 100% of exactly what's happened. It's like straight outta this book, which is somebody, Elon,\nsticks his hand up (laughs) and says, \"The workers of the\nworld are not going to unite.\" - Yeah.\n- Right. Or the emperor is actually\nwearing no clothes, right? You know that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is\nstanding there by themselves, and everybody else in\nthe audience is like, \"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna\nhappen to that guy,\" right? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn't know, the\nfirst guy doesn't know, other people don't know, like,\nwhich way is this gonna go? And it may be that's a minority position and that's the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that's a majority position and you are now the\nleader of a revolution. And then basically, of\ncourse, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that\ndoesn't get killed, (laughs) the second guy does... Well, a lot of the time\nthat guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn't get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing, all right? Now, you've got two. Two leads to four, four leads\nto eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia\nand Eastern Europe in '89, when it goes, it can go, right? And then it rips. And then what happens\nis very, very quickly, if it turns out that you\nhad a large percentage of the population that actually believed\nthe different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, \"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority.\" And at that point, like you\nwere on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. Right, now. The other part of this is the distinction between the role of the\nelites and the masses. And here the best book is called \"The True Believer,\" which\nis the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this 'cause the elites do idea\nformation and communication. But the elites, by definition\nare a small minority. And so there's also this giant\nrole played by the masses, and the masses are not\nnecessarily thinking these things through in the same\nintellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure\nexperiencing these things in their daily lives,\nand they for sure have at least very strong\nemotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the\nelites lined up with, or either the current elites change or a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually\na different better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the, you know, to\nfollow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is\nalso happening right now. And again, case study\none of that would be Elon and you know, who turns out, you know, in truly massive following. - And he has done that over and over in different industries, not\njust saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit\nin the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. - Yeah. And it's like, well,\nbut then there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, and this is where, you know, there are many specific\nthings about Elon's genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit,\nbut in his mind it's true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else. He's not right all the time. But at least my through\nline with him both in what he says in public and\nwhat he says in private, which by the way are\nthe exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about\nwhat he believes in private, or at least he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's 100% consistent\nin my experience. By the way, there's two guys who are 100% consistent like that I know. Elon and Trump. (both laughing) - Yeah.\n- Whatever you think of them. - [Lex] Yeah. - What they say in\nprivate is 100% identical to what they say in public. Like, they're completely transparent, they're completely honest\nin that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful\nleaders of these movements, 'cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost\neveryone else actually believes, but nobody was actually\nwilling to say out loud. And so they can actually\ncatalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this\nframework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party, as I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind\nof conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one\nwho was saying them. And so the again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes, like we're\ngoing this other direction. That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual\nmechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me\nthat we have been living through exactly this. We've been living through\neverything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav\nHavel described, (laughs) you know, Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've been living\nthrough the, you know, the true believer elites\nmasses, you know, thing with, you know, with a set of like\nbasically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the loyalty masses anymore, and a set of new elites that\nare running away with things. And so like, we're living through this like\nincredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a\nmoral of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really\nbad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they\nhave to do, you know, to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. - So one of the ways to avoid\nthat in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between\nwhat's said in private and what's said in public small. - Yeah. It's like, well, this\nis sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep\npeople from saying things, which means we can keep\npeople from thinking things. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know, by the way, that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean,\nagain, the hard form, you know, Soviet Union\nowning a mimeograph, pre-photocopiers, there\nwere mimeograph machines that were used to make samizdat\nand underground newspapers, which is the mechanism\nof written communication of radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death, right? So that's the hard version, right? You know, the soft version\nis somebody clicks a button in Washington and you are\nerased from the internet, right? Like, which, you know, good\nnews, you're still alive. Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your\nfamily now, you know, they hates you and won't\ntalk to you, but you know, you know, whatever the version\nof cancellation has been. And so like, does that work? Like maybe it works for a while, like it worked for the\nSoviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially\nwhen it was coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like\nincredible speed and ferocity. 'Cause to your point, there's\nall this bottled up energy. Now, your question was like,\nwhat are the percentages? Like what's the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. It's like you've got 20%, like true believers in\nwhatever is, you know, the current thing, you know, you got 20% of people who are just like\ntrue believers of whatever they, you know, whatever's\nin the new, like I say, whatever's in The New York\nTimes, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation,\nlike they're just believe. And by the way, maybe\nit's 10, maybe it's five, but let's say generously it's 20. So you know, 20% kind of\nfull-on revolutionaries. And then you've got, let's\ncall it 20% on the other side that are like, \"No, I'm\nnot on board with this. This is crazy. I'm not signing up for this.\" But, you know, they view themselves as they're in a small minority, and in fact, they start\nout in a small minority, 'cause what happens is the\n60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people. And it's not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying\nto go to work each day and do a good job and be a good\nperson and raise their kids and, you know, have a little\nbit of time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, political activism or any of this stuff. It's just not their thing. But that's where the over\nsocialization comes in, it's just like, okay, by\ndefault, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the\nradical revolutionaries, at least for a while. And then the counter elite\nis in this other 20%. And over time, they build\nup a theory and network and ability to resist and a\nnew set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's\na contest and then, right? And then the question is,\nwhat happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kinda my point, it's not even really does\nthe 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like,\nokay, what is the thing that 60% now decides to\nbasically fall into step with? And I think that, in the valley, that 60% for the last\ndecade decided to be woke and, you know, extremely, I would say, (laughs) on\nedge on a lot of things. And you know, that 60%\nis pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it. - And I would love to\nsee where that pivot goes 'cause there's internal battles\nhappening right now, right? - So this is the other thing, okay, so there's two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is, he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you're gonna have\nis you're now gonna have people in the other direction. You're\ngonna have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't, (laughs) right?\n- Right. - So it's gonna swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's\nnot the only part of this, but you know, he's just a\nconvenient shorthand for, you know, for a lot of this. But, you know, whatever it is, you'll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, right? Or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled\nthat person, right? Where of course, they were\nfull on a part of the mob, like, you know, kind of at\nthat moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference\nfalsification happening in the other direction. And his prediction, I think,\nbasically is you'll end up with the same quote,\n\"problem\" on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. You know, how far is American\nsociety willing to go on any of these things? I don't know. But like, there is some question there. And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this, you\nknow, elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those\npeople are still in power and they're in very, you\nknow, important positions. And The New York Times is\nstill The New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard. And like, those people haven't\nchanged like at all, right? And bureaucrats in the governments and, you know, senior democratic, you know, politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there, you know, right now feeling like reality\nhas just smacked them hard in the face 'cause they\nlost the election so badly. But they're now going into a, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War, right? And that form of the Civil\nWar is completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize\n'cause we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half\nof them are saying, \"No, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak, we were too soft. You know, we must become\nmore revolutionary. We must double down and we\nmust, you know, celebrate, you know, murders in the street of health insurance executives.\" And that right now is like a real fight. - If I could tell you\na little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a\nhistorian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking\nabout having a podcast, on doing a podcast. And he eventually said that,\n\"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I\njust don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are\nthe particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would\nsurprise a lot of people if I said who it is. You know, this is a\nperson who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80-plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Okay? Nevertheless, he just\ndoesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just\nhave a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk\nto your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are\nfeeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts,\nhow quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you\nmentioned 20, 60, 20 matters and the contents of the\nprivate groups matters, and the dynamics of how\nthat shifts matters. 'Cause it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. There's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these\nnew vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold. - Yeah. So he's a friend of yours, I respect that you don't wanna name him. I also respect you\ndon't wanna beat on him, so I would like to beat\non him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? - Yes. He should use it. - So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate\nindictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart\nof our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it's, by the way, it's\nlike across the board, it's like all the top universities. It's like, 'cause the\nsiren song for right? What it's been for 70 years,\nwhatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure\nsystem, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an\nacademic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what\nyou actually think, right? Then you can do your\nwork and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these\npeople have done to it. Like it's gone, like that entire thing was\nfake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely, completely giving up the\nentire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually\n100% by taxpayer money. - What's the inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this,\nwhat can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? - That the population at large is gonna realize the\ncorruption in their industry and it's going to withdraw the funding? - (laughs) It's okay. So desperation. (laughs)\n- No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next.\nOkay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources\nof federal funding. The big one is a federal\nstudent loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of\ndollars at this point. And then only spiraling, you know, way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know\nthat when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as\nmuch as 70% of the money for central uses. - [Lex] Yeah. - Number three is tax exemption\nat the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit\ninstitutions as opposed to, let's say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close\nto a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources\nof federal taxpayer money, and then for the state\nschools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild, 'cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at University of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed\nand I'm cheering for them, but the problem is, you're now inserting. Suppose you and I wanna\nstart a new university and we wanna hire all the\nfree thinking professors, and we wanna have the\nplace that fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. I'll give you the most direct reason, we can't get access to that money, we can't get access to\nfederal student funding. Do you know how\nuniversities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They're not accredited by\nthe Department of Education. Instead, what happens is, the Department of Education\naccredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that\ndo the accreditation. Guess what the composition of\nthe accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to\nfederal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic\nthey are about accrediting a new university? Right, and so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone... I mean, it's just obvious now. It's just gone like sideways in basically any possible\nway it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting beaten\nup on campus for being, you know, the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every\npossible way at this point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these\nthings without replacing them. And there's no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's\nlike everything in life. I mean, in a sense, this is\nlike the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when\na company does a bad job, is they go bankrupt and another company\ntakes its place, right? And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that\nis what happens is this is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? 'Cause things are tested and tried, and then you, you know, the things that are good survive. And so these places\nhave cut themselves off. They've been allowed to cut\nthemselves off from both, from evolution at the institutional level and evolution of the\nindividual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable\nin their current form. - I disagree with you on that. Maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can\nrevolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford\nand MIT are important. - Oh, but that logic\ndoesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. - Underpants gnome, can you\nexplain what that means? - Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started\nwatching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is \"South Park.\" - Yes.\n- And there is- - Wow. - And there is a, which by the way is a little\naggressive for a nine-year-old. - Very aggressive. - But he likes it. So he's learning all kinds of new words. - And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. - I told him, I said, \"You're\ngonna hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\" - Right. (laughs) Education. - And I said, \"You know\nhow we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I said, \"Not using a word that you learn in here\ndoes not count as lying.\" - [Lex] Wow.\n- \"And keep that in mind.\" - This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. - And of course, in the\nvery opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls\nthe other kid a dildo. Right, we're off to the races. - Yep. Let's go. - \"Daddy, what's a dildo?\" - [Lex] Yep. (both laughing) - So, you know, \"Sorry son, I don't know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So the-\n- Underpants gnome. - So famous episode of \"South\nPark,\" the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat... All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing the underpants. And it's just like, well,\nwho on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it's\nthe underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants\ngnomes that come to town and they've got this\nlittle underground warrant of tunnels in storage places\nfor all the underpants. And so they go out at night,\nthey steal the underpants, and the kids discover that, you\nknow, the underpants gnomes, and they're, you know,\n\"What are you doing? Like what's the point of this?\" And so the underpants gnomes\npresent their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit.\n- Yeah. - [Marc] Step two, question mark. (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So you just proposed the underpants gnome-\n- Yeah. - Which is very common in politics. Oh, so the form of this in politics is we must do something.\n- Yeah. - This is something,\ntherefore we must do this. But there's no causal logic chain in there at all to expect\nthat's actually gonna succeed 'cause there's no reason to believe that it is.\n- Yeah, but- - And it's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the\nhost of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I hear this, I have friends\nwho are on these boards, right?\n- Yeah. - Very involved in these places, and I hear this all the\ntime, which is like, \"Oh, these are very important. We must fix them.\" And so therefore, they're fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. - If there's that pressure\nthat you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty primary, fire a lot of the administration and realign and reinvigorate\nthis idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't... Because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is\naligned with this very idea that you're talking about. It's this meaning like\nintellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface it's aligned, underneath it's become corrupted. - If we say free speech and\nacademic freedom, often enough, sooner or later, these tenured\nprofessors will get brave. - Wait, do you think the universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions\nfor educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit\nthat's outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create\ninstitution like that? - How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? - Right. You invent something new? - You open a new restaurant. - Yeah. - Like how often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that's just absolutely horrible, and it's poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you\ngo back and it's fantastic? Charlie Munger actually\nhad the best comment on, this great investor, Charlie Munger, has great comment. He was once asked, he's like,\nyou know, his, you know, General Electric was going\nthrough all these challenges and he was asked to do Q&A. It said, \"How would you fix the culture at General Electric?\" And he said, \"Fix the\nculture at General Electric?\" He said, \"I couldn't even fix\nthe culture at a restaurant.\" (Lex laughing) Like, it's insane. Like obviously you can't do it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nobody in business\nthinks you can do that. Like, it's impossible. Like it's not, now look, having said all that, I\nshould also express this 'cause I have a lot of friends\nwho work at these places and are involved in various\nattempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong, I\nwould love to be wrong. I would love for the\nunderpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how\nto do. I would love to fix it, I'd love to see them come back\nto their spoken principles, I think that'd be great. I'd love to see the professors\nwith tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I\nmean, it would be fantastic. You know, my partner and I have done like a lot of\npublic speaking on this topic, it's been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay,\nlike these challenges have to be confronted directly. By the way, let me also\nsay something positive. You know, especially post-October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart\npeople who are major donors and board members of these\ninstitutions like Marc Rowan, you know, who are really\ncoming in trying to, you know, I think legitimately\ntrying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He's working overtime to try to do this. Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question\nwould just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? - I'm a person that\nbelieves in leadership. If you have the right leadership- - [Marc] Right. - The whole system can be changed. - So here's a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? - You know how I think runs it? - [Marc] Yeah. - Whoever the fuck says they run it, that's what great leadership is. Like a president has that power.\n- But how does- - President of university has the leverage 'cause they can mouth off like Elon can. - Can they fire the professors? - They can fire them through\nbeing vocal publicly, yes. - Can they fire the professors? - What are you talking about legally? - [Marc] Can they fire- - No, they cannot fire the professors. - Then we know who runs the university. - The professors? - Yeah, professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they're, of course, in a radicalization\nfeedback cycle driving- - You said feral students?\n- The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows\nis that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them\nbecause they cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same\nthing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They cannot outlast you. I mean it's the whole thing\nthat, it's the resistance. Like they can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. - That's definitely a crisis\nthat needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that\nI'm defending academia here. I agree with you that\nthe situation is dire but I just think that\ninstitutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been\ngrilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation\nyou said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's- - I didn't say Dairy Queen\nis a great restaurant. - Let the listener take- - I said Dairy Queen\nis the best restaurant. - The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc\nAndreessen is saying today- - I don't wanna-\n- Put that into cont- - You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard.\n- Yeah. - They can get like\n4,000 calories in a cup. - They can and they're delicious. - [Marc] It's amazing. - They're truly delicious-\n- They're really fantastic. And they'll put anything in there you want.\n- All right- - Okay, so, but anyway, lemme just close by saying, look, my friends at the university\nsystem, I would just say, \"Look like, this is the challenge.\" Like I would just pose\nthis as the challenge. Like to me, like this is, having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation\nthat actually has to happen. This is the bar that\nactually has to be hit. These problems need to\nbe confronted directly, 'cause I think there's been way too much, I mean, I'm actually worried\nkinda on the other side, there's too much happy talk\nin these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers\ncome to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is\ngoing through, you know, no fault of any of ours,\nbut like the fuse is going and there's some window of time here to fix this and address\nit and justify the money 'cause it just, normal taxpayers sitting in\nnormal towns in normal jobs are not gonna tolerate\nthis for that much longer. - You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep\ninto the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to\nspeak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were\nthere when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of\ncensorship on social media. So take me to, through\nthat history, if you can, the use of censorship. - So I was there on the\nground floor in 1993. (both laughing) - There's multiple floors to\nthis building, apparently. - There are.\n- (laughs) Yeah. - So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. - That is fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. Actually, 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. - Did you have the courage to\nspeak up back then? (laughs) - I did not have any problems\nspeaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, you know, I\nwas legitimate, you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research\nproject actually funded by the federal government\nat a public university. So, you know, I don't\nthink my boss was like in any way outta line,\nbut it was like, yeah, like this web browser thing is great, but like could it just make\nsure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for\na second, as a technologist, I had a issue, which is this\nwas like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm (laughs) that I was going to have to design. And then apparently a variety of other, apparently body parts people are also sensitive about.\n- Yeah. - And then I politely declined to do this. - For just the technical\ndifficulties of it. - Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm a, you know,\nI'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days the internet\ngenerally was, you know, a free-fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting\nas sort of pre-'93, the internet was such a\nspecific niche community. Like, it was like the million\nkind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually like\ndidn't really have a lot of, you know, issues that people\nwere like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn't\nwanna start the process. So I think the way to think\nabout this, so first of all, you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I've been involved with\nthis at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007, so I've seen everything\nin the last, you know, almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I've been involved in most of the other companies over time, so I was an angel investor in Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover\nof Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we\nwere the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk\nspecifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you\nlike the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah, so basically the\nway to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that\ncan have zero censorship. And by the way, that also\nmirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited\nfree speech either. The US First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from\nthe Supreme Court over time. You know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're not\ncovered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are gonna\nstart an internet company and have a service, we can't\nhave that stuff either, right? 'Cause it's illegal or\nit will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always gonna\nhave a censorship engine. I mean, hopefully, it's not\nactually in the browser, but like you're gonna have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now\nyou have a machine right now. Now you have a system where\nyou can put in rules saying, we allow this, we don't allow that. You have enforcement, you\nhave consequences, right? And once that system is in place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now\nanybody in that company or anybody associated with that company, or anybody who wants to\npressure that company will just start to say, \"Okay,\nyou should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\" And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like\nvery, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided\nwith the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. You know, it's the kids that\nwere in school between like, you know, for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and like, they came out\nlike super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started\nmounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that\nthese companies were, you know, very subject to being controlled and the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors\nwere almost all Democrats and, you know, there's\ntremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from\nthe first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people\nand other, you know, law enforcement\nintelligence people came in and worked, and you know, they were all Democrats for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they, you know, picked it up and put it\non, and then they just ran. And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech\nconversation started exactly like you'd expect, which is,\nwe can't have the N-word. And which the answer is fair enough, let's not have the N-word. Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right? And Jordan Peterson has\ntalked a lot about this. The definition of hate\nspeech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, right? So we can't have things that make, you know, people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like me that are\ndisagreeable raise their hands and say, \"Well, that idea right there\nmakes me uncomfortable.\" But of course, that doesn't\ncount as hate speech, right? So, you know, the ring\nof power is on one hand and not on the other hand. And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently like\ncompletely anodyne comments that are completely\nlegitimate on television or on the Senate floor all\nof a sudden our hate speech can't be said online. So that, you know, the\nring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the\nstuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little\nbit of that early on, but of course, that really\nkicked in with Trump. So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by like three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence\nof the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you\nknow, a ring of power that was even more powerful, right? Because, you know, hate\nspeech, it's like, okay, at some point, if\nsomething offensive or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with\nmisinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, what do we know for 800 years or whatever Western civilization, it's that, you know,\nthere's only a few entities that can determine the\ntruth on every topic. You know, there's God, you\nknow, there's the king. We don't have those anymore and the rest of us are\nall imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any\ngroup of experts is gonna sit around the table and decide\non the truth is, you know, deeply anti-Western and\ndeeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation\nkind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax\ninto just full-blown, we're gonna use that weapon\nfor whatever we want. And then of course, then the\nculminating moment on that, that really was the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was we're gonna censor all theories that the COVID virus might\nhave been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies\nlike that was the point where people for the first\ntime, this is like what, three years ago for the\nfirst time they were like, and that was when it sunk in\nwhere it's just like, okay, this has spun completely outta control. But anyway, that's how\nwe got to where we are. And then basically that spell lasted that complex existed and\ngot expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and so when I am super\nproud of those guys, 'cause they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were gonna be\na free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And, you know, they\ntried to just beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by\nthe way, from, you know, let's say certain of the\nplatform companies, you know, basically threatening them.\nAnd they stood up to it. And, you know, sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum\nof speech and conversation, you know, anywhere on planet Earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way, it's great. And then obviously Elon, you\nknow, with X was the, you know, the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. - And there's also like singular moments, I think you've spoken about\nthis, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. - [Marc] Yes. - There's certain moments that just kinda shake\neverybody up, the right person, the right time, just it's a wake-up call. - So that there, and\nI will tell you, like, and I should say Jon Stewart\nattacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him, but I would say, I would say\nlong run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of \"The Daily Show\" when he was on it, you know, for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance\non the Colbert Show. And I don't know how\nbroadly this is, you know, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don't know how,\nif people remember this, but I will tell you in the\nrooms where people discuss what his misinformation and these policies, that\nwas a very big moment. That was probably actually\nthe key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I\nwould say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who\ndon't recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, like, you know, you absolutely\nmust lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep\nall the schools closed. You absolutely must have\neverybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a\nmask like the whole thing. And then one of those was,\nyou absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you're a fascist\nNazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person, right? And that was like uniform\nand that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don't know if\nthey planned it or not, 'cause Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much of it was a bit, but he went on there and\nhe just had one of these, like the Emperor's wearing no\nclosed things where he said, \"It's just not plausible that you had the COVID\nsuper virus appear 300 yards down the street from the\nWuhan Institute (laughs) of lethal coronaviruses.\" Like, it's just not plausible that certainly that you\ncould just rule that out. And then there was another\nkey moment, actually, the more serious version\nwas I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big\npiece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is like\none of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been like\nalt, you know, renegade, there had been, you know, people\nrunning around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was\nlike in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember let's say a board meeting at one of these companies after that, where basically, you know, everybody looked around\nthe table and was like, \"All right, like, I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore.\" And, you know, and then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \"Well, wait a minute, why were we censoring\nthat in the first place?\" And okay, like, and then, you know, the\ndownstream, not that day, but the downstream\nconversations were like, \"Okay, if we made such\na giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective\nmistake censoring that, then what does that say about\nthe rest of our regime?\" And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. - I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made\nwas a courageous act. - [Marc] Yeah, I agree. - I think we need to have\nmore of that in the world. And like you said, Elon,\neverything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg\ndid on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? - He has become, I think, an outstanding\ncommunicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for\na lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he's, you know,\nhe's one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And you know, as you do\nwith all of your episodes, like when somebody sit\nand talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody 'cause it's really hard to\nbe artificial for that long. And, you know, he's now\ndone that repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then, look, again, I would maybe put him in\nthe third category now with, certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put\nhim up there now with, you know, kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that. Like he said on that show\nwhat he really believes, he said all the same things\nthat he says in private. Like, I don't think there's\nreally any discrepancy anymore. I would say he has\nalways taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running\na company the size of Meta and to running services\nthat are that large. And I think, you know, his\nconception of what he's doing, which I think is correct,\nis he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. And then, you know, the\ncompany has, you know, many tens of thousands of\nemployees and many investors, and it's a public company,\nand he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so, you know, he has\nnot felt like he has had, let's just say, the complete\nflexibility that Elon has had. And, you know, people could\nargue that one way or the other, but, you know, he talked about a lot. He's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm gonna put\nmyself right back up there. Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this.\nLike, I've also learned a lot. Like, my views on things\nare very different than they were 10 years\nago on lots of topics. And so, you know, I've\nbeen on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as, or better\nthan anybody else I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show\nabout something very important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a set of decisions\nthat you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and\nso forth and it's valid, but you are under tremendous\nexternal pressure as well. And by the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've got your executives\nin some cases coming at you. You've got your board in\nsome cases coming at you. You've got your\nshareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire\nnonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you and, you know, that's\nthe really, you know, stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation\nof the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, then again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they\nclearly didn't wanna do and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I say, like I've known every CEO of Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the\njob, it was just daily beatings. Like it just getting punched in the face every single day, constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting (laughs) physically\npunched in the face, and then-\n- Getting better and better. Yeah. - You know, and he's very good\nat, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people\nto have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate\nwith like, I would say, extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in\nhis job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a\nlot about him that he has, you know, risen to this\noccasion the way that he has. And by the way, I should\nalso say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, you know, legitimate\nthing for people to say, but you know, it's like, \"Oh, you're only doing\nthis because of Trump, or, you know, whatever.\" And it's just like, no, like\nhe has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them\nout for a very long time. And so I think what\nyou saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the moment thing that could change at any time. - So what do you think it's like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal\npressure and external pressure? What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? - That's a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like, it's not a thing, right? And again, legitimately so, like CEOs get paid a lot,\nlike the whole thing. There's a lot of great things about it. So it's not like they\nshould be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that\nthey are human beings. And it is the case that\nit is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job is because your words\ncarry tremendous weight and you are dealing with\nextremely complicated issues, and you're under a tremendous\namount of emotional, you know, personal, emotional stress. And, you know, you often end\nup not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like, keep up an exercise routine\nand all those things. And you know, you come under family stress 'cause you're working all the time. Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO of our last company before\nwe started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life\nwas even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was like supposed\nto be like having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you get that a lot. But the key thing is like, you\ncan't talk to people, right? So I mean, you could talk to\nyour spouse and your kids, but like, they don't understand that they're networking in your company. They don't understand, have\nthe context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And they can't resist. Like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily\nrely on what they say. It's very hard in most\ncompanies to talk to your board because they can fire you. Now, Mark has the situation\n'cause he has control, it actually turns out he\ncan talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about\nmany things that he does that most CEOs won't talk\nto their boards about because we literally,\nbecause we can't fire him. But a general, including\nall the CEOs of Twitter, that none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the board members, they're gonna fire you, you\ncan't talk to the shareholders 'cause they'll just like\ndump your stock, right? Like, okay, so every once in a while, what you find is basically the\nbest-case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a\nlittle bit outta that. But even that's fraught with peril 'cause can you really talk\nabout confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it's just a very\nlonely isolating thing to start with. And then on top of that,\nyou apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal, external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand\nmost forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. - Hmm.\n- Right. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external\npressure you can withstand, and by that I mean\ninvestors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative article,\nyou know, negative headline and you know, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many\nof those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot withstand\nis the internal crack. And what I always look for in high-pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the\ninternal team cracks. Because I know the minute that happens, we're in a different regime. (laughs) Like, it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid. Like we're in a different regime and like the whole thing\ncan unravel in the next week 'cause then people turn, I mean this, I guess this is what's happening\nin Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire\nchief turned on each other, and that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get\nput back together again. It is over, it is not\ngoing to work ever again. And that's what happens\nto inside companies. And so somebody like Mark is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's been very good at\nmaintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,\na lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing\nI'd say, as I said, that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And especially, although not\nall one is government pressure. Is that when your\ngovernment comes for you? Like yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out\nof them in short order. - Can you just linger on that 'cause it is maybe educating\nand deeply disturbing? You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again\nthis government pressure. So you think they've crossed a line into essentially criminal\nlevels of pressure? - Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs) but yes, absolute criminality. - Can you explain how\nthose possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? - So I just start with\nis a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good 'cause it needs\nto be in the public record. And so there's three forms of things that are in the public record\nthat people can look at. So when is the Twitter Files,\nright, which Elon put out with the set of journalists\nwhen he took over. And I will just tell\nyou, the Twitter Files are 100% representative of what I've seen at every\nother one of these companies. And so you can just see\nwhat happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies,\nyou know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind\nof pressure that they got. So that's number one. That's stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven't. The second is Mark referenced\nthis in the Rogan podcast. There's a congressman Jim Jordan, who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, you\nknow, whatever three years have done a full-scale\ninvestigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have\nnow been made public and you can download those reports. And there's like 2,000 pages\nworth of material on that. And that's essentially\nthe Facebook version of the Twitter Files just arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself\ntalking about this on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just\ndefer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is\nbasically the government, you know, over time and then\nculminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years, just decided that the First\nAmendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that\nfederal laws around free speech and around conspiracies\nto take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure. They just like literally\narbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, you know, threaten repercussions and force them to censor. And you know, there's\nthis whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment\nonly applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't\napply to companies. It's like, well, there's actually a little\nbit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely\napplies to the government. Like 100%, the First Amendment\napplies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship\nregime that was put in place. There was no due process\nput in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just\nlike flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. And then there are\nspecific federal statutes, it's 18 241 and 18 242. And one of them applies to federal employees,\ngovernment employees, and the other one\napplies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United\nStates Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional\nrights are enumerated, for example, in the First\nAmendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes\naway rights that you have, they don't need to be\nspecifically enumerated rights in the Constitution order\nto still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have\nthe rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right, and so de-banking\nqualifies as a right, you know, right to access to the financial system,\nis every bit something that's subject to these\nlaws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, which is we've talked\nabout two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we've talked about the companies. The government employees\nfor sure have misbehaved. The companies, there's a very\ninteresting question there as to whether they are victims\nor perpetrators or both. You know, they will defend\nand they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims,\nnot perpetrators, right? They're the downstream\nsubjects of pressure, you know, not the cause of pressure, but there's a big swath of\npeople who are in the middle and specifically the ones that\nare funded by the government that I think are in\npossibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of these\nthird-party censorship bureaus. I mean the one that is\nsort of is most obvious is the so-called Stanford\nInternet Observatory that got booted up there\nover the last several years. And they basically were funded\nby the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in\nthis very interesting spot where there could be, you know, very obvious theory under\nwhich they're basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they're\nalso very exposed on this and have behaved in just\nflagrantly illegal ways. - So fundamentally, government should not\ndo any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? - Can't. Not allowed. - It really is disturbing. I mean it probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the the old will to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection 'cause you can't put a check\non power for government, right? - There are so many ways\nthat they can get you, like there are so many ways\nthey can come at you and get you and, you know, the thing\nhere to think about is a lot of times when people\nthink about government action, they think about legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It's like this, you know, fancy little bill sneaked\nalong and goes this- - I'm just the bill. Yeah.\n- Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. Like that doesn't actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly\nwhat we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about\ngovernment power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the\nequivalent of legislation, but having not gone through\nthe legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that\nthe DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They're regulated and there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche\nyou'll hear a lot, which is, \"Oh, private companies can\ndo whatever they want.\" It's like, \"Oh, no, they can't.\" They're subject to tens of\nthousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes\ndown when you don't comply with regulations is profound. Like they can completely\nwreck your company with no ability for you\nto do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole\nprogram a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency\nfor payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were gonna\nbuild into every product, and they were gonna be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government\nand they went to the, all these different try to\nfigure out how to make it, so it's like fully compliant\nwith anti-money laundering and all these, you know,\ncontrols and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters\nto the big banks saying, \"We're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every\naspect of your business is going to come under\ngreatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\" which is, of course, the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner\nrestaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov\ncocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? And like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a law, it's\nnot even a regulation, it's just like straight\ndirect state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they're just like flat\nout telling you what to do, which is, of course,\nwhat a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. And so anyway, so what\nthese companies experienced was they experienced the\nfull panoply of this, but the level of intensity\nwas in that order, it was actually, legislation\nwas the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important and then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were\nultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people\nwho don't do it, right? So like as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, you have to decide. You don't wanna live in\nthat regime. I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people\non the right got very angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. You know, maybe some people on the left will now not want their, you know, Democratic nominees to\nbe so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written\nin the FT just now saying, we just need like broad\nafter what we've been through in the last decade, we need to broad base\ntruth and reconciliation, you know, efforts to really\nget to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like ultimately, we need\npeople to go to jail 'cause we need to set\nobject lessons that say that you don't get to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to\nthe new administration, and I don't wanna speak for them and I don't wanna predict\nwhat they're gonna do, but they for sure have\nthe ability to do both of those things and you know,\nwe'll see where they take it. - Yeah, it's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants\nthis kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people\nthat are participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's\nthat kind of protection. Nobody wants that. - So I use the metaphor, the ring of power.\n- Yeah. - And for people who\ndon't catch the reference, that's \"Lord of the Rings.\" And the thing with the Ring of Power and \"Lord of the Rings,\"\nit's the ring the Gollum has in the beginning and\nit turns you invisible. And it turns out it like unlocks all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically, the moral\nlesson of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which was, you know, written by a guy who thought very deeply\nabout these things is, yeah, the ring of power is\ninherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they're like, \"Gandalf, just put on the\nring and like fix this.\" Right, and he will not put the ring on even to like end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. And then, you know, as it starts, the character of Gollum is\nthe result of, you know, like a normal character\nwho ultimately becomes, you know, this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. And so, I mean, I think you said something\nactually quite profound there, which is the ring of power\nis infinitely tempting. You know, the censorship\nmachine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, like\nyou are going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting\n'cause it's so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people\nfeel any of this today. They should. I don't know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years\nlater, you know, you would hope that you would realize that\nyour soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being, you know, extremely authoritarian\nand anti-democratic and anti-Western. - Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the\nmost powerful human on Earth. - I'm not sure about that. - You don't think he is? - Well, he doesn't have the nukes so. - Nukes. (Marc laughing) Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? - Yeah. - How can he and/or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting\naspects of this power? - I mean, I think the\ndanger is there with power. It's flat out there. I would say with Elon, we'll see. I would say with Elon, and\nI would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would\nsay so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost\nevery front for like, you know, the last 30 years. (Lex laughing) But including all this stuff recently, like I think he's been a\nreal hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say,\nI guess the sort of case that he has this level of\npower is that some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are, you know, are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is, I do think a lot of how\nElon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's the companies\nhe's running directly where I think he's doing very well, and we're investors in multiple\nof them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements, and then it's the downstream\neffects of his statements. So like for example, it's, you know, for the last couple weeks,\nit's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this\nrape gang scandal, you know, this rape organized child\nrape thing in the UK. And you know, it's a preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren't willing to talk about it, it kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden\nthere's now in the UK this like massive explosion\nof basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's\nkind of woken up and being like, \"Oh, my God,\nyou know, this is really bad.\" And there will be now, you know, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know,\nhe played the role of the boy who said, the emperor\nhas no clothes, right? But here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about\nsomething that was true, right? And so had he said it about\nsomething that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody\nover there instantly, they were like, \"Oh, yeah,\nhe's right,\" right? (laughs) Like nobody seriously\nsaid they're just arguing the details now. So number one, it's like,\nokay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far... Put it this way. Like, how worried are we about\nsomebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say,\nespecially in the last decade of what we've been through where everybody's been lying\nall the time about everything, I'd say, I think we\nshould run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the\nmoney and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like it,\nthere's a clear-cut case that the more money in\npolitics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic\nof public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary\noutspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost. You'll notice that money and\npolitics has all most vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Trump spent far, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don't know, something like 3 billion total in Trump, I think spent again like a\nthird or a fourth of that. And so the money in politics kind of topic has kind of vanished from\na popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit\nnow that Elon is spending. You know, but again, it's like, okay, he's spending,\nbut the data would seem to indicate in the last, at\nleast in the last eight years, that money doesn't win\nthe political battles. It's actually like the\nvoters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there I\nwould say like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and use in a definitive way. - And I don't know if\nthose parallels there, but I could also say\njust on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that's not always the case. So that's a good thing there.\n- Yeah. - If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. (laughs) Who gets to put on the ring? - [Marc] Frodo. - Frodo, yeah.\n- Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of\n\"Lord of the Rings\" right, is even Frodo would've been, you know, even Frodo would've been corrupted, right? But, you know, nevertheless,\nyou had somebody who could do what it took at at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because it's sort of our\npost-Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort of this post-secularized\nChristian context in the West now, and it's, you know, we\nconsider Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe\nessentially all the same things. We just dress them up\nin sort of fake science. (Lex laughing) So the one thing that we're all told, we're all taught from early is that the best people in\nthe world are the people who care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know,\nall of our figures are people who care about all of, you know... Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared\nabout all of humanity. Like it's this universe, the person who cares the\nmost about everybody. And with Elon, you have a\nguy who literally, like, is, he talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly\nthe same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us through\nmulti-planetary civilization, so that we can survive a\nstrike on any one planet, so that we can extend the\nlight of human consciousness into the world and, you\nknow, into the universe and have it persist, you know, in the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. (both laughing) - Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. - Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear. - You said that we\nalways end up being ruled by the elite of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? - So this comes from a\nItalian political philosopher from about 100 years ago named Robert... I'm gonna mangle it from, let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. And then I learned about\nit through a famous book on politics, probably the\nbest book on politics written in the 20th century called \"The Machiavellians\"\nby this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in \"The Machiavellians,\" he resurrects what he calls is this sort of Italian realist school of political philosophy from the '10s and '20s. And\nthese were people, to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who\nwere trying to understand the actual mechanics of how\npolitics actually works. So to get to the actual sort\nof mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, Michels\nhad this concept ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law of oligarchy, and I mean take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy 'cause it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there's basically three\nforms of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of many. There's oligarchy, which\nis rule of the few. And there's monarchy,\nwhich is rule of the one. And you can just use that\nas a general framework of any government you're gonna be under is gonna be one of those,\njust mechanical observation without even saying\nwhich one's good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that\nMichels asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like is there actually\nsuch a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually\nlike direct government? And what he did was he mounted this sort of\nincredible historical exploration of whether democracies had\never existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most\ndemocratic private organization in the world that he\ncould find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist\nGerman autoworkers union that was like wholly\ndevoted to the workers of the world uniting, you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization\nout of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and\nhe is like, \"Oh, nope.\" There's a leadership class. You know, there's like six guys at the top and they control everything (laughs) and then they lead the rest\nof the membership along, you know, by the nose, which is, of course, the\nstory of every union. The story of every union is\nalways the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers' union, right? Like, you know, there's\na guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number\ntwo is his son, right? Like, that's not like a, you\nknow, an accident, right? So the iron law oligarchy\nbasically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling\nelite structurally. And he said, \"The reason for that is because the masses\ncan't organize,\" right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is\n25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize,\nthe majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in\npolitics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a\nsmall organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence... I forget the name of it. It was called like The Workers' Revolt or something like that. There was like a two-year period where they basically experimented\nwith direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition\nsystem, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. You know, anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes\nit's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe, and it's caused enormous\ndamage to the state. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And so of course, they didn't\ngive us a direct democracy, they gave us a representative\ndemocracy, right? And so they built the\noligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch\nand the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson\nof \"The Machiavellians\" is you can deny that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think\nabout how to make a system work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that\nis actually what's happening. - And lucky for us, the founders saw this\nand figured out a way to, given that there's going\nto be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite-\n- Yes. - So it doesn't get out of hand. - And it was very clever. Right? And you know, some of this was\nbased on earlier experiments. By the way, you know, these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of like Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance\nhistory, you know, \"The Federalist Papers,\" they\nargue this a great length. You can read it all. You know, they ran like a\none of the best seminars in world history trying\nto figure this out. And they went through all this and yeah. And so they thought\nthrough it very carefully, but just, I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did it just through the three\nbranches of government, right? Executive, legislative and judicial, sort of balance of powers. But the other way, they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done earlier. I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, right? And so the, you know,\nthe House and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population,\nand the Senate is not, right? The small states have\njust as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get\nreelected every two years to make it very responsive\nto the will of the people. And they made the decision\nto have the Senate get reelected every six years\nso that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose\none or the other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does\nit live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And you know, there's lots of open\nquestions there, but you know, this system has survived\nfor coming on 250 years with a country that has been\nspectacularly successful. But I don't think, at least,\nyou know, I don't think any of us would trade the\nsystem for any other one. And so it's, yeah, one of the\ngreat all-time achievements. - Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were\nall pretty young relative to our current set of leaders.\n- They were. Many in their 20s at the\ntime, and like super geniuses. This is one of those things\nwhere it's just like, all right, something happened where there\nwas a group of people where, you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einsteins of politics. Yeah. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical\npractice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused\non what would actually work, which is, you know, I\nthink the way to think about these things. - There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. - They were shape rotators,\nnot word cells. (laughs) - I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were center to them, you're center to a lot of memes. - [Marc] I was. - You're the meme dealer\nand the meme popularizer. - That's true. That meme I get some credit for and then the current thing is, the other one I get some credit for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. - Take credit and run with it. - [Marc] Yep. - If we can just linger\non the Machiavellians. It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned looking\nat the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've\nseen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting\nthings you can sort of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? - Yeah, so a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this\na bit with the universities, which is you can apply a\nMachiavellian-style lens to the... It's why I posed the\nquestion to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the\nuniversity, the trustees, the administration, the\nstudents or the faculty? And you know, the true\nanswer is some combination of the three or of the\nfour, plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera, right? And so you know, there's a mechanical\ninterpretation of that. I mean, companies operate\nunder the exact same, you know, set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like the CEO runs the\ncompany basically up to the day that either the shareholders\nor the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt,\nit's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it's very hard for the\nCEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if The New\nYork Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand\nis who can get who fired? You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper\ncolumnist who makes, you know, $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes, you\nknow, $200 million a year. And it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before\nI have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. - Did anyone ever get fired\nfrom the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? (laughs) So Bill like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. - No, 'cause what happens\nis they wear it with a... And yeah, I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, right? Which is, you know, if\nthey're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably\npriding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to legitimate criticism and, you know, they're\nobviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight\nto the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. You know, and I happen to know the CEO, and I think he's quite a good CEO, but I like, well, this is a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer\nrun his own company, right? Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating\nplaying out right now. Not to dwell on these fires, but you see the pressure\nreveals things, right? And so if you've been\nwatching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, like whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical\nsocial revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It's endorses every crazy\nleft-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of\nall the people who, you know, are currently burning\nthe city to the ground. It's just like endorsed\nevery single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, for the first time, I think put his foot down right\nbefore the November election and said, we're getting... He said, \"We're gonna get outta this thing where we just always\nendorse the Democrat.\" And we said, we're not\nendorsing, I think he said, \"We're not endorsing for the presidency.\" And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like our billionaire backer who's... And I don't know what he spends, but like, he must be burning 50 or 100\nmillion dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. He paid 500 million for\nit, which is amazing. Back when people still thought\nthese things were businesses. And then he's probably\nburned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another\n50, 100 million a year to do this. And the journalists at\nthe LA Times hate him with the fury of 1,000 suns. Like they just like absolutely\nfreaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones that\ncan get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, you know,\nmost horrible things about him. And they wanna constantly run\nthese stories attacking him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in\nLA are having right now to this fire, and to this just like\nincredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head\nendorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour,\nhe's basically just, he's decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his\nown newspaper. (laughs) Very smart guy. He is not a press tour and\nhe is basically saying, yeah, yes, we did all that and we\nendorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and\nwe're gonna completely change. And his paper is, you know,\nin a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn't been him. (laughs) It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, the\nowner is showing up saying, \"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge.\" And the reporters are\nsaying, \"No, you're not.\" And like it is freaking on. And so again, if the, the\nMachiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power\nactually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and super powerful who even\nowns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full-scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist? - And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there. - And firing people.\n- Firing people. Yeah. - You know, he has removed\npeople and he has set new rules. I mean, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying he's now at long last actually\nexercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other\nowners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know, so\nhe's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really\ninteresting open question. Like, you know, in a fight\nbetween the employees and the employer, like\nit's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. - And just to stay on\njournalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just wanna say put him in\nthe category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever\nseen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. - What do you think is like\nthe most impressive example? - Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to, like, I mean, it's like kicking\nthe beehive or whatever, you know, what's gonna follow and do that. I mean that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia\nand then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer\njust tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. And just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people\nlike that out in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be\ncourageous themselves. - Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? - I knew of Neri, his wife, who's a brilliant\nresearcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she's amazing. - Well, the reason I ask\nif you knew about Bill is because a lot of people\nhad not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before some of the\ncampaigns he's been running since in public, and with\nHarvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he was so-called activist\ninvestor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected\nfor probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out, they weren't for the most part battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national\nstories, but in the business and investing world, the\nactivist investor is a very, it's like in the movie \"Taken.\" It's a very specific set of skills. (both laughing) - Yeah. - On how to like really take control of situations.\n- Yeah. - And how to wreck the people\nwho you're going up against. And there's been\ncontroversy over the years on this topic, and there's\ntoo much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid is,\nyou know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly\nmanaged or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that\nmeans the existing management is become entrenched and\nlazy, mediocre, you know, whatever. Not, you're responding to the\nneeds of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically\ngo in with a minority position and then they rally support\namong other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show\nup and they force change. But they are the\naggressive version of this. And I've been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these-\n- Oh-oh. - Where it is amazing\nhow much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don't have formal control. So it would be another chess\npiece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens\nis the effective analysts, a large amount of time, they end up taking over\ncontrol of companies even though they never own more than like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it\nturns out with Bill's, it's such a fascinating case. 'Cause he has that like complete skillset. - (laughs) Yeah. - And he has now decided\nto bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of\nthese places, you know, and some of these battles\nare still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of\npeople who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now\nwith infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that\nkind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook, like in real time. And so Liam Neeson skillset is\ngetting more broadly diffused just by being able to\nwatch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody\nwho's really affecting how all this is playing out. - But even skillset\naside just courage and- - Yes, including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, 'cause like he hasn't been, I'll give you an example. Like my firm venture\ncapital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I\nfeel like I can't do or say 'cause I feel like I would\nbe bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where\nhe worries about that. And so a couple things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship\nwith his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors...\nI know this for a fact. His investors have been\nremarkably supportive of him doing that. 'Cause as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. And so it is the same thing he does in the his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip\nof the spear on something that actually a lot\nmore people agree with. - Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. - And just again, our, you know, how I started is a lot of\npeople are just fed up. - You've been spending a\nbunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new\nadministration in many ways, including interviewing\npeople who might join. So what's your general\nsense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new administration? - So I should start by saying I'm not a member of\nthe new administration. I'm not like in the room\nwhen a lot of these people are being selected. - I believe you said unpaid intern. - I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and I,\nyou know, when helpful, but I'm not making the decisions,\nnor am I in a position to, you know, speak for the administration. So I don't wanna say anything that would cause people\nto think I'm doing that. It's a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is outta office, and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll recall,\nthere was a fair amount of controversy over the\nend of the first term. - Oh, yeah. - The specific concern was, you know, the first Trump administration, you know, they will all say this is like, they didn't come in with a team, right? So you know, they didn't\ncome in with a team and most of the sort of institutional base of the Republican Party\nwere Bush Republicans. And many of them had\nbecome never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time\nputting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time\ngetting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them 2 to 3\nyears to kind of even get the government in place. And then they basically only\nhad the government in place, you know, for basically like\n18 months, and then COVID hit. You know, and then sort of\nthe aftermath and everything, and all the drama and\nheadlines and everything. And so the concern, you know, including from some various smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he gonna be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? 'Cause maybe people got burned out. Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing\nto go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people\nin the first term came under, like, you know, with their\nown withering legal assaults, and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a\nlot of stuff happened, lots of investigations,\nlots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots\nof debanking, by the way. A lot of the officials in the\nfirst Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. - Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. - In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and\nchildren with our ring of power. And so there's like\nthis legitimate question as to like, whether, okay, what will the team for\nthe second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing\nwith the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks\nbetter than the first term and not 'cause the\npeople in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like, influx of like incredibly\ncapable people that have shown up that wanna be part of this, and you just didn't have\nthat the first time. And so they're just\ndrawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than\nthey had the first time. And they're drawing on people\nwho know what the game is. Like they're drawing\non people now who know what is gonna happen and\nthey're still willing to do it. And so they're gonna\nget, I think, you know, some of the best people\nfrom the first term, but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get\nthe first time around. And then second is\nthere's a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they're just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned\nhow everything works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view and now they're 10 years older and they're ready to\ngo serving government. And so there's a\ngenerational shift happening. And actually one of the\ninteresting things about the team that's forming up is\nit's remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members,\nand then many of the second and third level people are\nlike in their 30s and 40s, you know, which is a big change\nfrom the gerontocracy that, you know, we've been under\nfor the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has\nbeen outstanding, you know, and we could sit here and\nlist tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people\nwho are running, you know, it's everything from the people who are running all the\ndifferent departments at HHS. It's the people running, you know, the number two at the\nPentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got, actually two of\nmy partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah, like many, many\nparts of the government, the people are like, really impressive. - Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the\nhuman being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's kind of circles\nof sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically\nsuck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good\nposition to speak to the degree that's happening versus\nhiring based on merit and just getting great teams. - Yeah, so look, I just\nstart by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are, you know, very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. Like he definitely seems\nvery aware of that. So that's one thing. I would just say that the, I\nthink the way to look at that, I mean, and look, like I said, I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say that it's again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished\npeople in the business world and in the medical field. I just, you know, Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH, so I was actually, I was\npart of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. - Nice. Jay's amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. - So I literally got, this is a story. I got to the transition\noffice for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the\ninterview interviewing teams, and they gave us, I didn't\nknow who the candidates were, and they gave us the\nsheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I\nsaw Jay's name, and I, like, I almost physically fell outta my chair. - Yeah. - And I was just like... (laughs) You know, and\nI happen to know Jay, I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like, talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure- - Yeah.\n- Over the last five years. - And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and\nthoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly- - Very serious, very\nanalytical, very applied. And yes, 100%. Tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look\nback at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you\nknow, none of us are perfect, but like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And, you know, we would all\nbe much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just like an\nincredibly capable guy. And look, and then he\nlearned from all that, right? He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody\nlike that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly. It's just a gigantic upgrade. You know, and then Marty\nMakary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a\nCDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been\nspending time with Dr. Oz, so, you know, and I'm not, like, again, I'm not on these teams. I'm not in the room. But like, I've been\nspending enough time trying to help that, like his level of insight into the healthcare system,\nit's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy\nwho's been like in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this\nstuff and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for,\nyou know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, he's like a walking\nencyclopedia on these things. And you know, very dynamic, you know, very charismatic, very\nsmart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have\nsomebody like that in there. And so anyway, they're\njust, I have like 30 of these stories now across\nall these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast\nto the last four years. And it, not even, these people\nare not in the same ballpark. They're just like wildly better. And so it, you know, the pound for pound is\nmaybe be the best team in the White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team\nlike this or something. But there's a lot of really\ngood people in there now. - Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to DOGE? What's the most wildly successful\nnext two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also, can you think\nabout the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges\nwould it be facing? - Yeah, so start by\nsaying, again, I'm not... Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer, I'm not on DOGE, (laughs)\nI'm not a member of DOGE. - We should say there's\nabout 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring. No, I'm just kidding. - Both the angels and\nthe devils on my shoulder are-\n- Okay. All right, cool. - So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE. I'm not in charge of DOGE.\n- Yeah. - Those guys are doing\nit, I'm not doing it. But you know, again,\nI'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, I mean, the basic outlines\nare in public, right? Which it's a time limited, you\nknow, basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the\nexecutive branch, right? And so the implementation\nwill happen through the White House. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is the three kind of streams,\nyou know, kind of target sets, and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. And so, you know, the headline\nnumber, they, you know, put us the $2 trillion number and there's already, you know, disputes over that and whatever, and there's whole question there. But then there's the people thing. And the people thing is\ninteresting 'cause you get into these very kind of\nfascinating questions. And I've been doing this,\nI won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this\nfor people in government as a pop quiz, and I can stump\nthem every time, which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere\nbetween 450 and 520. And nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for\nthe federal government? And the answer is, you know,\nsomething on the order, I forget, but like 4\nmillion full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large\npeople component to this. And then by the way, there's\na related component to that, which is how many of them\nare actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings\nare still empty, right? And then there's questions\nof like, are people, you know, working from home? Or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension, and of course, the money and\nthe people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing, right? And I described earlier\nhow basically our system of government is much more\nnow based on regulations than legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that\nwent through Congress. They're from an agency that,\nthat created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is, Elon have already described, we wanna do the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the\ngovernment off people's backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. But there's also something\nelse that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set\nof Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that\nwent directly after the idea that the executive branch can\ncreate regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding\ncongressional legislation. And most of the federal\ngovernment that exists today, including most of the departments\nand most of the rules, and most of the money,\nand most of the people, most of it is not enforcing\nlaws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \"Large parts, you know, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress,\nthe way that the cartoon said that it should, that may\nnot actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to, they\ndid nothing based on this. They didn't, you know,\npull anything back in. But the new regime, if they\nchoose to, could say, \"Look, the thing that we're doing here is not, you know, challenging the laws, we're actually complying with\nthe Supreme Court decision that basically says we have\nto unwind a lot of this, and we have to unwind the regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional, we have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people.\" And that's how you get from, basically you connect the\nthread from the regulation part back to the money part,\nback to the people part. They have work going on\nall three of these threads. They have, I would say,\nincredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super\ncynical on this topic. And they're like, \"This is impossible. This could never possibly work.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I can't tell you what the secret plans are,\nbut like blow my mind.\" And all three of those,\nlike, they have ideas that are like really quite\namazing as you'd expect from, you know, from the people involved. And so over the course of the\nnext few months, you know, that'll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is, this is going to be very\ndifferent than attempts, like there have been other\nprograms like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one, and then there were others\nbefore that, Reagan had one. The difference is this\ntime, their social media. And so there has never been like, it's interesting, one of the\nreasons people in Washington are so cynical is because\nthey know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad\nspending and all the bad rules and all the, like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion\ndollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that's compounding, and\nit's now passing the size of the defense department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon it's gonna\nbe adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be\nadding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point we enter a\nhyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or\nBrazil and (indistinct), right? And so, like everybody in\nDC knows that something has to be done, and then\neverybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible\nto do anything, right? They know all the problems and they also know the sheer\nimpossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're\nnot taking into account, that what the critics are not taking into account\nis these guys can do this in the full light of day and\nthey can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism, they can expose any element\nof, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government spending. They can run victory\nlapse every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the\npeople into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our\nMachiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy,\noligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of\nthe few, rule of the one. You could think about what's\nhappening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president, rule\nof the one with some power. And then we have the\npeople who can't organize, but they can be informed\nand they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich\nhappening right now, is a way to think about it, which is you've got basically (indistinct) if you got rule of one combining with the rule of many, right? And rule of many is they\ndo get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically. And then essentially\nCongress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic\nclass in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, I think have the power to\ndo all kinds of things here, and I think that would be\nthe way I would wash it. - The transparency. I mean, Elon, just by\nwho he is incentivized to be transparent and show\nthe bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's gonna be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just\nmakes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. - These people are spending our money. - [Lex] Yeah. - These people have enormous\ncontempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here's the thing\nyou hear in Washington, here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear\nis, \"This is impossible, they'll be able to do nothing.\" And then, yeah, I walk them\nthrough this and they're like, it starts to dawn on them that\nthis is a new kind of thing. And then they're like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in\nentitlements and the debt and the military.\" And so like, yeah, you've\ngot like this silly, fake whatever, you know,\nNPR funding or whatever, and like, it's a rounding\nerror and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever,\n$500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging\nstations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they bill eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And costs you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn't matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer\nis like, \"What the fuck?\" (Lex laughing) - What do you mean?\n- It's $30 billion. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then the experts are like, and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's surrounding error.\" No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this\ncavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you're\nabout the 3 trillion. - Yeah.\n- Okay. Then there's the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the\nfederal budget and percentage? No, it's not. But $30 billion divided\nby 30, do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like, what's that math expert? - $100. - $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic\nrelationship with your wife. There's like 100 things\nthat that person can do with $100 that they're not doing 'cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where\nthe money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that $30\nbillion program is not something that is like a very\nimportant thing to go after, is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer-\n- Yeah. - Is just off the charts. And then that's just\none of those programs, there's like 100 of those programs and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of\nthis stuff is running well, like the one thing we know is that none of this\nstuff is running well. Like we know that for sure, right? And we know these people\naren't showing up to work and like we know that all this crazy stuff is happening, right? And like, you know, do you remember Elon's\nstory of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. Okay so Pennsylvania is\nlike a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness, and death, right? And the federal government\nhas just like, let it happen, these incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing\nlaw enforcement thing that they needed to do in\nPennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling\nraw milk with armed raids. - [Lex] Right. - And it turns out it\nreally pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places\n'cause they don't have cars. But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the\nreasons why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law\nenforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, like the system's not working. And so you add up, just\npick $130 billion programs. All right, now you're okay. Math major, 100 times 100. - 10,000. - $10,000. Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. - But it's also not just about money. That's really, obviously money\nis a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude- - [Marc] Yes. - That then in sort of, in\nthe ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody\nwants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that corruption\ncan, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy 'cause you don't wanna be transparent about having done nothing all\nyear, all this kind of stuff. And you now wanna reverse that, so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government,\nbecause the amazing thing if you're to steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can\ndirectly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting. As long as there's no\nbureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. - Yeah. So here's the trick, this blew my mind 'cause I was, you know, once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in\ngovernment called impoundment. And so if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning\nis a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires\nCongress to authorize money to be spent by the\nexecutive branch, right? So the executive branch\ngoes to Congress says, \"We need money X.\" Congress does their thing. They come back and they\nsay, \"You can have money Y.\" The money's appropriated from Congress, the executive branch\nspends it on the military or whatever they spend it\non, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations\nto nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an\nadditional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which\nis the executive branch not only needs Congress to\nappropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is\nnot allowed to underspend. - Yeah, I'm aware of\nthis. I'm aware of this. - And so there's this thing\nthat happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal\nyear, which is September 30th, and it's the great budget flush. And any remaining money\nthat's in the system that they don't know how\nto productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively. - Yep. - To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn't wanna spend the\nmoney can't not spend it. - Yeah. - Like, okay, A, that's not\nwhat's in the constitution. And there's actually quite\na good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that's played\nout in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I\nthink an open mind, you're like, \"All right, this is not\nwhat the founders meant.\" And then number two, again,\nwe go back to this thing of contempt, like, can\nyou imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you're\ndoing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've\nsold your soul, right? Like it's just like, I actually\nthink you sort of had it in a really good point,\nwhich is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. - Yeah.\n- Right. 'Cause it makes them bad people. And they didn't start out\nwanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this like- - Yeah, everywhere.\n- Everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged\nwhat I've seen so far. - It seems like a lot of people\nwill try to slow 'em down, but yeah-\n- For sure. - I hope they get far.\n- Yeah. - Another difficult topic, immigration. - [Marc] Yeah. - What's your take on the, let's say, heated H-1B visa debate\nthat's going on online and legal immigration in general? - Yeah, I should so start by saying, I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I'm not planning to be,\nthis is not an issue that I'm working on or\nthat I'm going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing.\nSo my firm is doing, so like, I'm not in this in the new\nadministration or the government. I'm not planning to be, so\npurely just personal opinion. So I would say I would\ndescribe as a complex or nuanced, hopefully\nnuanced view on this issue that's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I kind of thought\nabout this, you know, I didn't say anything about\nit all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a\nlot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a\nvery different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because\nof the combination of where I came from and\nthen where I ended up. And so, oh, let's start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration\nargument many, many times the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been\nin DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of\ntrying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more\nhigh-skilled immigration. And, you know, I think that\nargument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, has paid off for the\nUS in many, many ways. And we can go through it,\nbut I think it's the argument everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's, right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. - So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you\ncan get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity\nof the US companies. - Yeah, and then it's not just good for the them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry,\nit's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that\nthen create many more jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would've previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Like everybody wins,\nthere are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely\nglorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be\na moral right argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against\nit is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right, I mean that-\n- Right. - That's the thing. And like I said, I've made\nthat argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd also say, look,\nI would say number one, I believe a lot of it,\nI'll talk about the parts I don't believe, but\nI believe a lot of it. And then the other part is,\nlook, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, like\nmy own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends, you know,\nare just this like amazing, you know, panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And you know, I've worked,\nI dunno at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And hopefully, over time, it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And you know, it's been amazing and they've done many of\nthe most important things in my industry and it's\nbeen really remarkable. So that's all good. And then, you know, there's\njust the practical version of the argument, which\nis we are the main place these people get educated anyway, right? The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, this is the old kind of Mitt\nRomney, staple a green card to every, you know, at least, you know, maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologist\nwe could quibble about, but you know, the roboticist\nfor sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- - At least I won you\nover on something today. - Well, no, I'm\nexaggerating for effect, so- - Oh. (Marc laughing) And I lost you,\nI had you for half a second. - I haven't gotten to the\nother side of the argument yet. - [Lex] Okay, thank you.\n- So surely, we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. - The rollercoaster is going up. - The rollercoaster is\nrationing slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists\nshould all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot\nof merit to that, obviously. Like, look, we want the\nUS to be the world leader in robotics. What step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the\ngreat robotics people, right? Like, you know, very,\nunlike the underpants. No, it's like a very\nstraightforward formula, right? - Yeah. - All right, that's all\nwell and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that you also hear from,\nyou know, these same people, and I have made this\nargument myself many times, which is, we need to do this because we don't have\nenough people in the US who can do it otherwise, right? We have all these unfilled\njobs, we've got all these, you know, all these companies\nthat wouldn't exist. We don't have enough good founders, we don't have enough engineers, we don't have enough scientists. Or then the next version\nof the argument below that is our education\nsystem is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way, 'cause like our education\nsystem is good enough for foreigners to be able\nto come here preferentially in like a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native-born people. So there's like a weird, there's\nlittle cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into and kind of wonder about, and we'll come back to that one. But like, at least, yes, our\neducation system has its flaws. And then underneath that is\nthe argument that, you know, Vivek made, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, you know, native-born\npeople in the country, you know, don't work hard enough, and spend too much time\nwatching TV and TikTok and don't spend enough\ntime studying differential, you know, equations. And again, it's like, all\nright, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair amount to that. Like there's a lot of American\nculture that is, you know, there's a lot of frivolity,\nthere's a lot of, you know, like, I mean, we have\nwell-documented social issues in many fronts, many things that cut\nagainst having a culture of just like straightforward\nhigh achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those\nare the basic arguments. But then I have this kind of\nother side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought\nprocess, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And you know, it's interesting,\nthere's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin\nto, you know, high tech. And so it's like, all right,\nwhy is that exactly, right? And then I know this, I'm an aberration. Like I was the only one\nfrom anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right? I know what an aberration I am, and I know exactly how\nthat aberration happened, and it's a very unusual,\nyou know, set of steps, including, you know,\nmany that were just luck. But like, there is in\nno sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like, not at all. There is also like, in no sense\na talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from\nthe South into high tech. There is no flow from the\nSunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the Deep South into high tech. Just like, literally it's like the blank. There's this whole section of the country that just where the people\njust like for some reason don't end up in tech. Now, that's a little bit strange, 'cause these are the people\nwho put a man on the moon. These are the people who built\nthe World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the Second\nIndustrial Revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network, and built, you know,\nlogistics and transportation in the auto in, I mean,\nthe auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people's\nparents and grandparents and great grandparents\nsomehow had the wherewithal to like build all of\nthis like amazing things, invent all these things. And then there's many,\nmany, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism\nwhere you had people who grew up in the middle of\nnowhere, Philo Farnsworth, who invented the television,\nand just like, you know, tons and tons of others,\nendless stories like this. Now you have a, like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, okay, like what is happening on\nthe blank spot of the map? And then of course, you\nalso can't help noticing that the blank spot on the\nmap, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, \"Oh,\nwell, that's interesting. Like how did that happen?\" Right? And so either you really,\nreally, really have to believe the very, very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you\nhave to believe that like, that basically culture, the\nwhole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country\nis so like, deeply flawed, either inherently flawed\nor culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they are not able to do the\nthings that their, you know, parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess\non what else is happening? - You mean what, affirmative action? - Affirmative action. Okay. (laughs) This is\nvery, think about this, this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. - Right. - Nor does it have any victims at all. - That could explain\nmaybe disproportionate, but like, surely it doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. - What educational institution\nin the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? - But what institution rejected\nfarm boys from Wisconsin? - All of them.\n- All of them. - Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this\nis because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago, these were big court cases. And you know, 'cause the\nidea of affirmative action has been litigated for\nmany, many, many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly\nin the past had upheld that it was a completely\nlegitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative action that\nlike really matter, right? One is the admissions into\neducational institutions, and then the other is jobs, right? Getting hired. Like, those are the two biggest areas. The education one is like super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time, for all, you know, people have written and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments\nfor why it's important, there's many arguments as\nto how it could backfire. It's been this thing. But the Supreme Court upheld\nit for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer, I don't\nhave the exact reference in my head, but there was a\ncase in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O'Connor famously\nwrote that, you know, although it had been 30\nyears of affirmative action, and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended,\nshe said that, you know, well, basically we need to\ntry it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically\nthe issues it's intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming\nup on the 25 years, right? It's a couple years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases is, it's a Harvard case and I think a University\nof North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those\ncases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions\nactually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit\nas cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it's a ring of power. And if you're an admissions\nofficer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power\nto do what you want, and you can justify any of\nit under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases,\nit had been a black box where you didn't have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically\nrequired showing the work. And there was like all kinds\nof like phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there\nwere text messages in there that will just curl your hair of people, of students being spoken of and just like crude racial stereotypes that would just make you\nwant to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. But also, there was\nstatistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is\nthat at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs\nfor SAT that are as wide as 400 points, right? So different groups. So a specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points\nhigher than other ethnicities in order to actually\nget admitted into these. I mean, this is not even about, I mean, white people are a part of this, but like Asians are like\na very big part of this. And actually the Harvard\ncase is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students\nwho were being turned away. And it's basically, I\nmean it's the cliche now in the valley and in\nthe medical community, which is like if you want a super genius, you hire an Asian from Harvard 'cause they are guaranteed\nto be freaking Einstein. 'Cause if they weren't, they were never getting admitted, right? Almost all the qualified\nAsians get turned away. So they've been running this,\nit's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been\na third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really\nchanged the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthey can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a\nsingle education institution in America that is conforming\nwith the Supreme Court ruling. I think they're all\nflagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. - Mostly 'cause of\nmomentum probably, or what? - They are trying to make\nthe world a better place. They're trying to solve\nall these social problems. They are trying to have\ndiverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They're trying to make\ntheir faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they're good people. - [Lex] Right. - They're trying to have\nthe press write nice things about them. Like it's nearly impossible for them. And you know, to be clear,\nlike nobody has been fired from an admissions office for,\nyou know, 25 years of prior, what we now, the Supreme Court now is\nruled to be illegality. And so they're all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so like I, you know, the numbers are moving a little bit, but like, I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they're\ncompliant with the Supreme Court. Like who's in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university's rule of the\nSupreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules\nthe universities, right? Well, another example of that is, I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right\nnow went to either Harvard or Yale, right? Like the level of\nincestuousness here is... Anyway, so there's that. And so this has been running\nfor a very long time. So one is the Harvard and\nUSC cases kind of gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the\nother thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was\nhappening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at\nall the top institutions for Jewish applicants was\nthey were being managed down, either being actively\nmanaged down as a percentage of the base. And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely\nexplicit, basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative\npercentage of the US population, which is 2%. And you know, there's\na whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago,\nJews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big\ncampaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became\n30% of these institutions 'cause there's so many\nsmart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been\ntrying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish\npeople I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, right? And so all of a sudden, so basically, the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this\nin terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in\nterms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? And then, of course, there's the thing that you\nbasically can't talk about, which is all the white\npeople are being excluded. And then it turns out it's\nalso happening to Black people, and this is the thing that like blew my freaking\nmind when I found out about it. So I just assumed that\nlike, this was great news for like American Blacks, because like, you know, obviously\nif you know Whites, Asians and Jews are being excluded,\nthen, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was\nto get the Black population up. And so this must be great\nfor American Blacks. So then I discovered this New\nYork Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? (laughs) - [Lex] Uh-oh. - And again, and by the way,\nthis is in The New York Times, this is not in like, you know, whatever, National Review,\nthis is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that\nwere quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the dean of the\nAfrican-American Studies, you know, community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme\nCourt appointee under, I think she was a close\nfriend of Hillary Clinton. And there was, for a long time, she was on the shortlist\nfor Supreme Court. So one of the top, you know, jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black was sort\nof legendarily successful in the academic and\nlegal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the\nauthorities in this story and the story that they tell, (laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education institutions and\nit's happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government, which\nis at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard\nwere not American-born Blacks. They were foreign-born Blacks, specifically, Northern\nAfrican off generally Nigerian or West Indian, right? And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very\nsuccessful Nigerian-Americans as a group like way outperformed, they're, you know, this a\nsuper smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said\nin the story is Harvard is basically struggling to\neither, whatever it was, identify or recruit, make successful, whatever it was,\nAmerican-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were\nusing high-skill immigration, as an escape hatch to go get\nBlacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs in the last 20 years have had\nthis exact characteristic. There's large numbers of\nBlack people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \"It's obviously not us that\nare getting these slots, we're literally competing with people who are being imported.\" And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action,\nyou are trying to make up for historical injustice\nof American Black slavery. So the idea that you're import\nsomebody from, you know, Nigeria that never\nexperienced that, you know, is like tremendously\ninsulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see\nwhere I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year\nsocial engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into, right? And so it turns out it's\nnot a victim-free thing, there's like 100%, there's victims. 'Cause why? There's only so many, for sure. There's only so many education slots. And then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs, right? You know, Google only\nhires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers, right? And so that's the other side of it, right? And so you're a farm\nboy in Wisconsin, right? You know, Black American\nwhose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship,\n300 years ago, in Louisiana or a, you know, Cambodian\nimmigrant in, you know, the Bronx and you are a kid or a Jewish\nimmigrant or a, you know, or from a very successful Jewish family and you know, your entire, you\nknow, for three generations, you and your parents and\ngrandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those\ngroups know is the system that has been created\nis not for them, right? It's designed specifically\nto exclude them. And then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, \"Yeah, let's bring\nin more foreigners,\" right? And so anyway, so the\nshort version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the, quote,\n\"high-skill immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also\nhaving the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another\nword for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative\naction conversation. And you need to actually\ndeal with this at substance and to see what's actually\nhappening to people. you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for\nhigh-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took\nover both the education process and the hiring process.\n- Okay, so first of all, that was brilliantly laid\nout, the nuance of it. So just to understand, it's\nnot so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to\nbe more people saying, yay, we need more American-born hires. - So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on\nthis and not saying anything, and what I was... (Lex laughing) Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of- - Yeah, that was very Zen. - Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of\nit, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the\ndog that didn't bark, right? And the dog that didn't\nbark was, I did not, and you tell me if you saw one, I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart\nkids who are already here into these educational\ninstitutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. - That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.\n- But it was like literally, it was like the proponents\nof high-skilled immigrant. And again, this was me\nfor a very long time. I mean, I kind of took\nmyself by surprise on this because I was on, you\nknow, I had the much, say, simpler version of this\nstory for a very... And like I said, I've been\nin Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But you know, I've been on\nthe other side of this one, but I was literally sitting\nthere being like, all right, which of these like super\ngeniuses who, you know, many of whom by the\nway are very, you know, successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled\nimmigrants, you know, which of these super\ngeniuses are gonna like, say actually we have this like\nincredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about native-born\nAmericans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure. Those four groups. - But also-\n- Yes. - White people. - Yeah, and also white people. - People that are making the\ncase for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're\nmaking that case are often not making it in a way that's like, making it in quite a radical way. - Yeah.\n- Let's put it this way. - Yeah, but you have\nthis interesting thing, you have a split between\nthe sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. - Right. - Right, and I'm using air\nquote for people listening to audio. I'm making quotes\nin the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can.\n- Yep. - One side has all the certified experts. The other side just has a\nbunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite\nknow how to explain it. And what was so unusual\nabout the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of Supreme Court, is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time, actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record, they actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, 'cause if you don't have\nexperts, what do you have? You know, something is wrong, but you have primarily\nan emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, you know, that\na certified expert can? And no, you can't, like, you\nknow, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. Yeah, and so it's just\nlike, all right, now, by the way, look, I think there are ways\nto square the circle, I think there's a way to\nhave our cake and eat it too, like I think there'd be\nmany ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with\nhigh-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is\nunder much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for\nuniversities to do that, they are still doing it,\nbut they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part, that's happening\nfor a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate\nlawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court\nrulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just as a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let add one more nuance to it that makes it even more complicated. - Yeah. - So the cliche is we're gonna\nbrain drain the world, right? You've heard that? We're gonna take all the smart people from all over the world,\nwe're gonna bring them here, we're gonna educate them, and\nthen we're gonna keep them, and then they're gonna\nraise their families here, create businesses here,\ncreate jobs here, right? - In the cliche, that's\na super positive thing. - Yeah. Okay, so what happens to\nthe rest of the world? - They lose? - Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious,\nhighly conscientious, highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that\nmany and they all come here and they all aren't where\nthey would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So it's almost impossible\nfor us here to have that conversation, in part because we become\nincredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just\nsimply all the same, which is a whole thing\nwe could talk about. But it also, we are purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the\nworld, not the other way around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow\nof high-skilled immigration over time, there's only\nfour permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration\nplaces people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. - Oh, Australia. - It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four\ncountries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk\nabout this I've discovered because the Eurozone\nis, whatever, you know, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over\ntime have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I\nthink it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've\nbeen migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this\nreally hit the fan was in Greece, right? So, you know, Greece falls\ninto chaos, disaster, and then, you know, you're\nrunning the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic\ndevelopment plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. Like, what are you gonna do, right? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. Not because, in part, because of this, 'cause we enthusiastically\nrecruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining\nUkraine for a long time. But also, of course,\nyou know, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, you know, when it comes\ntime for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it\ngonna have the talent base even that it had five years ago is like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, like\nwe have brain drained a lot of really smart people outta Russia, a lot of them are here, right? Over the last, you know, 30 years. And so there's this thing, it's actually really funny\nif you think about it. Like, the one thing that\nwe know to be the height of absolute evil that the\nWest ever did was colonization and resource extraction, right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and\nthe English and you know, everybody else went and had\nthese colonies and then went in and we, you know, took all the oil and we took all the diamonds,\nor we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason we realized\nthat's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's\ncompletely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious\nand beautiful and wonderful and you know, the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral\njustice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one\nsecond what we're doing to the countries that we're\npulling all these people out of. And this is one of these\nthings like, I don't know, like maybe we're just gonna live in this delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't care what happens, but like, I think there may come, this is like one of these submarines 10 feet under the waterline. Like, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly\nrealize, \"Oh, my God, what are we doing?\" 'Cause like, we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? Like we need these other\ncountries to like flourish. Like we don't wanna be the\nonly successful country in the middle of just like\ncomplete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and\nwe extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it. - Well, this is so deeply\nprofound, actually. So what is the cost\n\"winning\" quote, unquote, if these countries are drained\nin terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics,\nwhat does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually\nwant them to be strong in the way we understand\nstrong, not just in every way. So that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. - Yep. - It's interesting, this is one of those\ntruths where you just speak and it resonates, and I\ndidn't even think about it. - [Marc] Yeah, exactly. - So you were sitting\nduring the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that said-\n- Yeah. - There's still to use\nsome good to the H-1B? - Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's- - Come all the way around. (laughs) - There's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance,\nwhich is mostly the valley, we don't use H-1Bs anymore,\nmostly we use O-1s. So there's a separate class of these, and the O-1 is like this, it turns out the O-1 is\nthe super genius visa. So the O-1 is the basically our founder, like when we have somebody\nfrom anywhere in the world and they've like invented a\nbreakthrough new technology, and they wanna come to\nthe US to start a company, they come in through an O-1 visa. And that actually is like\na, it's a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, but it's like a pretty high\nbar. And they do a lot of work and there's like a, you have\nto put real work into it and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened\nwith the H-1B visa program is that it has gone to\nbasically two categories of employers. One is the basically a small\nset of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies\nthat you would think. And then the other is, it goes to these, they call kind of the mills,\nthe consulting mills, right? And so there's these set\nof companies with names, I don't wanna pick on\ncompanies, but you know, names like Cognizant that, you know, hire, basically have their business model is bring in primarily\nIndians in large numbers, and you know, they often have, you know, offices next to company-owned housing. And they'll have, you know,\norganizations that are, you know, they'll have,\nyou know, organizations that are literally thousands\nof Indians, you know, living and working in the US and they do basically call it\nmid-tier, like IT consulting. So you know, these folks,\nthey're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a year or $100,000 a year, not the, you know, 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, like in practice, the startups, basic like\nlittle tech as we call it, or the startup world,\nmainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point and mainly can't, 'cause the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of\nunderlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, you know, Amazon, like Amazon's a\nin like I love Amazon, but like they're a big powerful company. You know, they've got, you\nknow, more money than God. They've got resources, they've got long-term\nplanning horizon, they do big, you know, profound things over,\nyou know, decades at a time. You know, they could, you know, or any of these other companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you know, you'll\nnotice they don't do that. You know, they bring in, you know, 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, like,\nthere's lots of questions around them and whether\nthey should, you know, whether that's even a\nethical way to, you know, I don't wanna say they're\nunethical, but there's questions around like exactly what\nthe trade-offs are there. Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, you know, nobody\nreally wanted to be opened, you know, to play devil's\nadvocate on all this in terms of like national\nimmigration issues, you know, none of this is like a top end issue just 'cause the numbers are small, right? And so, you know, I don't think, you know, the administration has said like, this is not like a priority\nof theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is like, there is actually a lot of\ncomplexity and nuance here. I have a lot of friends,\nlike I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues\nwho are, you know, who came over on H-1Bs,\nor O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens and you know, every single\none that one of them was not every single one, a lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the honor of immigrants throughout\nthis whole period. And they said to me,\nit's like, \"Well, Marc, you know, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance\nof high-skilled immigration to the US?\" And I was like, I think\nyou can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent and be like, do you\nwanna inflame the issue or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right? And I think the answer\nis to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one\nmore positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up\non the university some more. Do you know about the National\nMerit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? - Not really, can you explain? - So there's a system that was\ncreated during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when... It was when people in\ngovernment actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an ideas that sounds today. And so it's basically a\nnational talent search for basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify\nbasically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of\nother characteristics. So there's no race, gender,\nor any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory\nSAT that you take, and then the SAT. So it uses those scores,\nthat is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. So they use the SAT as a\nproxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to like 1% of\nthe population of the kids, 18 year olds any given year\nwho scored highest on the PSAT, and then they get down to\nlike further qualify down to the 0.5% that also\nreplicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right? So it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the\nbest and the brightest. How many of our great and\npowerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities\nall have sports teams, they all have national scouting,\nthey have full-time scouts who go out and they go\nto every high school and they try to find all\nthe great basketball players and bring them into the\nNCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities\nuse the National Merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids\nand just bring them in? - Let me guess, very few. Zero.\n- Zero. (laughs) - As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that\nsame level of scouting for talent internally. - Go get the smartest ones. I'll give you one more\nkicker on this topic if I haven't beaten it to death. You know, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a\nhighly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like\nthe whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the\ncollege board that runs it. And it has been essentially\nlike everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so the in two ways, number one, it's been dumbed down where\nan 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost\nimpossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, right? And so, it's been\ndeliberately dumbed down. And then two is they have tried to pull out a lot of what's\ncalled the g-loading. And so they've tried to detach\nit from being an IQ proxy 'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable, right? So the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has\nreally started to work. And one of the things you\nsee is the Asian spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is\nbecause it's more coachable now. And the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the coaching\nthing is really difficult 'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents\ncan afford coaching, right? And I don't know about\nyou, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT\nwas until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. So, number one, there's issues there, but the other issue there is\nthink about what's happened by the dumbing down,\n800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It's like the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they\nhave AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. 'Cause what you want\nis you want, whatever, if it's gonna be 100,000\nkids, I don't know what it is, it's gonna be 50,000\nkids a year scoring 800. You also then want kids\nto be able to score 900 and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200, and you wanna ultimately get to, you know, you'd like to ultimately\nidentify the top 100 kids and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the\ntest has been reduced, so that it actually is\nnot useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption that's taken place\nthroughout this entire system where we have been heading\nin the reverse direction from wanting to actually go\nget the best and brightest and actually put them in the\nplaces where they should be. And then just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System\nis it's comp, like I said, it's completely race\nblind, it's gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic. It's only done on test scores. You know, and you can make\nan argument about whether that's good or bad, but\nit is, you know, for sure, you know, it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed\nmerit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose\nto do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it like incredibly striking and an enormous moral\nindictment of the current system that there are no universities\nthat do this today. So back to the immigration\nthing, just real quick. It's like, okay, we aren't even trying\nto go get the smart kids out of the center of-\n- Yeah. - And even if they think that they can get into these\nplaces, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for\nthe smart Black people. And like, it's just like,\nI don't know how, like, I don't know how that's moral. Like I don't get it at all. - As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times and I've always gotten\nperfect on math, 800. And I'm not that I'm not special like, it doesn't identify genius. I think you wanna search for genius and you wanna create\nmeasures that find genius of all different kinds,\nspeaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and\nover, defend immigrants. Yes. But say we should hire\nmore and more native-born. - Well, you asked me in the beginning like what's the most optimistic\nforecast, right, that we could have? And the most optimistic\nforecast would be, my God, what if we did both? (laughs) - So that's the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. - Well, it would diffuse the entire issue. - [Lex] Yeah. - If everybody in the center\nin the South of the country and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they\nwere getting a fair shake, like it would diffuse the issue. Like how about diffusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical... Sorry, I don't mean to really get out over my skis here, but- - I think your profile on X\nstates, \"It's time to build.\" It feels like 2025 is\na good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for\nanybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build\nsomething useful in the world or maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch\napps, services, whatever, ship software products. So maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? - So I mean, a big part\nof the answer I think is we're in the middle\nof a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking\nabout this on your show, but like AI coding, I mean,\nthis is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the investment of software. And I'm sure you, and you\nknow, we're involved in various of these companies, but\nyou know, these tools, you know, from a variety of companies are just like absolutely revolutionary and they're getting better by\nleaps and bounds every day. And you know, all this, but like the thing with coding, like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever. But like for sure, we\ncan make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate\nthe results of coding. And so, you know, there's all\nthese methods of, you know, synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is gonna get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean\nanybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and\nlook at AI coding demos, you know, little kids\nmaking apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. I mean I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary. You know, in a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain\nyourself, you know, start using these things, get\na huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more\nquickly than you could before. - That's actually a tricky\none in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like\nyou still need to learn how to code, it becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately\nbe a one person company and get quite far. - I agree with that, up to a point. So I think, for sure,\nfor quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are gonna be the best at\nactually having AI's code things, 'cause they're gonna understand\nwhat I mean, very basic. They're gonna understand\nwhat's happening, right? And they're gonna be able\nbe able to evaluate the work and they're gonna be able to, you know, literally like manage AIs better. Like even if they're not\nliterally handwriting the code, they're just gonna have\na much better sense of what's going on. So I definitely think\nlike 100% my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds of coding classes, and he'll keep doing that\nfor certainly through 18. We'll see after that. And so like for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you\ncan do with an AI is say, teach me how to code, right? And you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, I'll name names,\nyou know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing at\nKhan Academy for free. And then we, you know, we\nhave this company, Replit, which is was originally\nspecifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that's just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this and yeah, that, I mean, the\nAI's gonna be able to teach you to code, AI, by the way, is as you know, spectacularly good at\nexplaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools\nhave these features now where you can talk to the code base and so you can like literally like ask the code base\nquestions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and\npaste code into ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it\nwhat's going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so yeah, there's\ndozens of ways to do this. By the way, you can also, I mean even more broadly than code. Like, okay, you wanna make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art\ngeneration, sound generation, dialogue generation,\nvoice generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like,\nyou don't need designers, you know, you don't need, you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then, you know, a big is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's interfacing\ninto other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments\nor something like that. And, you know, AI's fantastic\nat writing glue code. So, you know, really,\nreally good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you\nfigure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write\na business plan for you. So it's just this, it's\nlike everything happening with AI right now, it's just, it's like this latent superpower and there's this incredible\nspectrum of people who have really figured out\nmassive performance increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't\neven aware it's happening. And there's some gearing to\nwhether you're a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races. And I think there are lots\nof professional coders who are still like, eh... You know, the blacksmiths were\nnot necessarily in favor of, you know, the car business. So yeah, there's the old\nWilliam Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just\nnot evenly distributed yet.\" And this is maybe the most\npotent version of that that I've ever seen. - Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" - Right.\n- It is very common. The programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true. I consider myself\nreasonably good programmer, and my productivity has\nbeen just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming\nis more efficient, more productive, more fun,\nall that kind of stuff. - I would also say code is, you know, code has of anything in\nlike industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the\neasier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's\nunlimited demand for code. Like, in other words, like\nthere's always some other idea for a thing that you can do,\na feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, like overwhelmingly, you know, the amount of code that\nexists in the world is a fraction of even\nthe ideas we have today. And then we come up with\nnew ideas all the time. And so I think that\nlike, (laughs) you know, I was in the late '80s, early '90s, when sort of automated\ncoding systems started to come out, expert systems,\na big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called the \"Decline and Fall of the\nAmerican Programmer,\" you know, that predicted that\nthese new coding systems were gonna mean we wouldn't\nhave programmers in the future. And of course, the number\nof programming jobs exploded by like a factor of 100. Like, my guess is we'll have\nmore coding jobs probably by like an order magnitude\n10 years from now. That will be different,\nthey'll be different jobs. They'll involve orchestrating\nAI, but there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry\nwill just explode in size. - Are you seeing the size\nof companies decrease in terms of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? - All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. - [Lex] Oh, for the big tech? - And little tech.\n- And little tech. - Everybody's trying to\nhire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it's 100%. I mean, there's a handful\nof company, you know, there's a little bit,\nthere's customer service, you know, we have some\ncompanies and others 'cause I think it's\nKlarna that's publicizing a lot of this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. But like for engineering jobs, like, it's just an explosion of hiring that at least, so far, there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am\nlooking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first\ncompany to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. So basically, the companies that we see are\nbasically one of two kinds. We see the companies that are basically sometimes\nuse weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies,\nI sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point\non whatever they're doing. - (laughs) Sure. - Right? And it's on the slide, right?\n- Yeah. - So they've got the, you know, whatever, da, da, da, da, da, and then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is, 'cause they had already\npreviously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the\nsix bullet point in the slide, which is how you're\ngetting all these products that have like the AI button\nup in the corner, right? The little sparkly button. - Yep.\n- Right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which\nI'm like, I don't need that. Like, I need you to answer\nmy email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay, so we see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then we see the strong\nform, which is the companies that are building from\nscratch for AI, right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally\nan AI email system, as an example, so just- - Oh, nice. I can't wait. - Yeah, they're gonna completely. So the very obvious idea,\nvery smart team, you know, it's gonna be great. And then, you know,\nNotion, just, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a\nproduct. And so now companies are gonna basically come through, sweep through, and they're gonna do\nbasically AI-first versions of basically everything. And those are like\ncompanies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. - Yeah, Cursor is an example of that. They basically said, okay,\nwe're gonna rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. - What if we knew from scratch\nthat we could build on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the Full Employment Act\nfor startups and VCs is, it just like if a\ntechnology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development\nprocess over from scratch, 'cause you need to\nreconceptualize the product, and then usually what that\nmeans is you need a new company 'cause most incumbents just won't do that. And so, yeah. So that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for is the\ncompany where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned\nas a result of AI, right? So I'm looking at, I'm\nwaiting for the company where it's like, no, we're\ngonna have, like, you know, and the cliche, here's a\nthought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're gonna have like the human executive team, and then we're gonna have the\ntheis be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of engineering\nsupervising 100 instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right by the way, or maybe the VP of\nengineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs, right? 'Cause one of the things that\nAI should be pretty good at is managing 'cause it's\nlike not, you know, it's like a process-driven,\nit's the kind of thing that AI's actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so should it be an AI executive team? You know, and then, of\ncourse, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, right? You know, and then maybe\nthe most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set\none of these things loose and let it basically\nbuild itself a business? And so I will say like\nwe're not yet seeing those, and I think there's a little bit of, the systems aren't quite\nready for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, like a founder who's really willing to break all the rules and\nreally willing to take the swing. And those people exist, and\nso I'm sure we'll see that. - And some of it is, as you\nknow, with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have\na AI-first email client, seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail\nis really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google\ncan't do it, because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer\nthe entirety of the system. 'Cause feels like Google's\nperfectly positioned to do it. Same with like, you have\nPerplexity, which I love, like Google could technically\ntake on Perplexity and do it much better,\nbut they haven't, not yet. So it's fascinating why\nthat is for large companies. I mean that is an\nadvantage for little tech, they could be agile. - Yeah, that's right.\n- They can move fast. - Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can't-\n- Right. - This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in\n\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which is sometimes when big\ncompanies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too much glass. It would specifically, it would interfere with\ntheir existing customers and their existing businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly,\nthey shouldn't do that, right? And so they just get, this is Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they're well-run, not\nbecause they're poorly run. But they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing against\nthe existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Like every once in a while, one breaks the pattern\nand actually does it. But for the most part, like this is a very predictable\nform of human behavior, and this fundamentally\nis why startups exist. - It feels like 2025 is\nwhen the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. Like, it's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI. Who do you think wins the AI race? - I would say, I'm not gonna predict, I'm gonna say there's\nquestions all over the place. And then we have this\ncategory question we call the trillion-dollar\nquestion, which is like, literally depending on how it's answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there's like, I don't know, 5 or $6 trillion questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I'll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small models. Another is open models\nversus closed models. Another is whether you can\nuse synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political\ntrillion-dollar questions. You know, policy\nquestions, which, you know, the US and the EU have both\nbeen flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is\nabout to really succeed at. Yeah, and then there's\nprobably another, you know, half dozen big important\nquestions after that. And so these are all just\nlike, say, this is an industry that's in flux in a way\nthat I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious\nexample of the flux is you know, sitting here\nless than three years ago, sitting here in December of '22, we would've said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today,\nit's like, you know, there's at least six, you know, world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of\nthe most shocking things to me, is like, it turns out that once\nyou know that it's possible to build one incredibly\nsmart Turning-test-passing large language model,\nwhich was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it\nturns out within, you know, a year, you can have five more. There's also a money\ncomponent thing to it, which is to get the money\nto scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There's basically right now\nonly two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers\ngiving you the money, which you turn around and\nroundtrip back to them. Or, you know, foreign\nsovereigns, other, you know, country sovereign wealth\nfunds, which can be, you know, difficult in some\ncases, for companies to access. So there's maybe another\ntrillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here's one. So Sam Altman has been\npublic about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a nonprofit,\nbeing a for-profit. The way that is legally done is that, and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and and other legal entities, government entities,\nscrutinizes very carefully, 'cause the US takes foundation\nnonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so the way that historically, the way that you do it\nis you start a for-profit and then you raise money\nwith the for-profit to buy the assets of the\nnonprofit at fair market value. And, you know, the last\nfinancing round at OpenAI was, you know, 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the\nflip is going to happen, the for-profit has to\ngo raise $150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. You know, raising 150\nbillion is a challenge. So, you know, is that even possible? If that is possible, then\nOpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, you know, I don't know. And then, you know,\nobviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the\nmarket leader today, you know, there's big important questions there. You know, Microsoft has this\nkind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind, but you know, they're\nvery good at catching up. Amazon, you know, is\nprimarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. - And then there's the other questions, like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly,\nopen versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. And then test on compute\nwith chain of thought. They're all of that. And it's just fascinating. And these are, I think it's fair to say,\ntrillion-dollar questions. - Yeah, these are big, like\nlook, you know, it's like, okay, here's a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations, right? Like, so if you are trying to\nuse these tools creatively, you're thrilled because\nthey can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this\nincredible stuff, right? They're creative. The flip side of that is if\nyou need them to be correct, they can't be creative. And that's, you know,\nthe term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And you know, there have been,\nyou know, court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court\ncitations, case citations. The judge is like, \"Wait a\nminute, this doesn't exist.\" And the very next is, \"Did\nyou write this yourself?\" And the lawyer goes, \"Er-\" (laughs) - I mean that's why with Elon, with Grok-\n- Yes. - Looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? - Yeah, that's right. And my sense is this very\ncontentious topic at the industry, my sense is if to the extent that there is a domain in\nwhich there is a definitive and checkable provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to\ngenerate synthetic data. You should be able to do\nchain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do\nreinforcement learning, and you should be able\nto ultimately, you know, eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that's a trillion-dollar\nquestion right there as to whether that's true. But then there's question of like, okay, is that gonna work in\nthe more general domain? Like, so for example, one\npossibility is these things are gonna get truly superhuman\nlike math and coding. But at like discussing\nphilosophy, they're gonna just, they're basically as smart\nas they're ever gonna be. And they're gonna be kind of, you know, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they're already outta training data. Like they literally, if, you know, you talk to these people,\nlike literally the big models, the big models are like\nwithin a factor of 2X of consuming all the\nhuman-generated training data to the point that some of these big companies are\nliterally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean\nthat like you have to, if you want your model\nto better philosophy, you have to go hire like\na thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody gonna do that? And so, you know, maybe these things are\ntopping out in certain ways and they're gonna leap\nway ahead in other ways. And so anyway, so we just\ndon't, you know, this is... Actually, maybe my main\nmain conclusion is, anybody telling, you know, anybody telling you these\nbig sweeping conclusions, you know, this whole super, you know, all of these abstract\ngeneralized super intelligence AGI stuff like, you know, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like, that's to abstract like,\nit's gotta actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have\nto be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem\nright now with the, you know, the big models that are like\nreally good at coding and math, they're like actually very\nexpensive to run, you know, they're quite slow. Another trillion-dollar\nquestion, future chips, which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean, all the global issue. Oh, another trillion-dollar\nquestion censorship, right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly, what are you\ntraining these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long did they give you these... How often do they give you these incredibly preaching moral lectures? Here's a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries\nwant their country to run its education system,\nhealthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing\nCalifornia politics, right? 'Cause that's kind of what\nthey have on offer right now. And I think the answer\nto that is not very many. So there's like massive\nopen questions there about like what, you know, and by\nthe way, like what morality of these things are gonna\nget trained on as a- - And that one we're cracking wide open with what's been happening\nover the past few months. Censorship on every\nlevel of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to be expand\nthe Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. - So what I experienced,\nyou know, going back to how we started, what I\nexperienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at like large scale, and then the war on the crypto\nindustry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared\nintent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under\nthe same kind of censorship and control regime as\nsocial media and the banks. And I think this election\ntipped, in America, I think this election\ntipped us from a timeline in which things were going to\nget really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are gonna be quite good. But look, those same questions\nalso apply outside the US and you know, the EU is doing their thing, they're being extremely draconian and they're trying to lock in\na political censorship regime on AI right now that's so harsh that even American AI\ncompanies are not even willing to launch new products\nin the EU right now. Like, that's not gonna last, but like, what happens there, right? And what are the trade-offs? You know, what levels of censorship are American companies\ngonna have to sign up for if they wanna operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them,\n(laughs) so that they can't? So big questions. - Quick questions. So you're very active on X. A very unique character, flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a meme, I\ndon't remember it exactly, but that Elon posted\nsomething like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I\nthink, you know, doing the, I take a big step back and\nfuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside\nyour mind when you're tweeting? - To be clear, a reference from the comedy\nclassic \"Tropic Thunder.\" - \"Tropic Thunder,\" yeah. Legendary movie. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Any Zoomers listening\nto this who haven't seen that movie, go watch it immediately. - Yeah, there's nothing\noffensive about it. - Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise's greatest performance. (Lex laughing) So-\n- Yeah. - Yeah, no, look, I should\nstart by saying like, I'm not supposed to be\ntweeting at all, so- - Yeah.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So, but, you know. - So how do you approach that? Like how do you approach what to tweet? - I mean, I don't. I don't well enough. It's mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there's a glory to it and there's an issue with it,\nand the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global\ncommunication, you know, X in particular is, you know, the town square on all these,\nyou know, social issues, political issues, everything\nelse, current events. But I mean, look, there's\nno question of the format. The format of at least\nthe original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I was tweeted something. It turned out that it's\nstill politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news\nin each time zone in India for a single tweet. So like, the single tweet outta context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously, X now has the\nmiddle ground where they, you know, they now have\nthe longer form essays. And so, you know, probably\nthe most productive thing I can do is longer form things. - You're not gonna do it though, are you? - [Marc] I do, I do,\nfrom time-to-time. I do. - Sometimes.\n- I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean,\nlook, but, and yeah, and obviously, X is doing great. And then, like I said,\nlike Substack, you know, has become the center for a\nlot, you know, a lot of the, I think the best kind of,\nyou know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly\nintellectual content, you know, tons of current events\nstuff there as well. And then, yeah, so, and then there's a bunch\nof other, you know, a bunch of new systems\nthat are very exciting. So I think one of the\nthings we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive\nreinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen with that. And it's happened on X, but it's now gonna happen\non other platforms. And then the other is crypto's gonna come right back to life. And actually that's\nvery exciting, actually, that's worth noting is that's another\ntrillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal\neconomic system for that, right? 'Cause it's a programmable money, it's a very easy way\nto plug in and do that. And there's this transaction\nprocessing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto\nAI intersection, you know, is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was gonna be\nimpossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do. - Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite\nthings about Yann LeCun? (Marc laughing) I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree\non a lot of things, but I personally like\nvigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the\ngladiators go at it, and- - No, he's a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn't\nsay we're super close, but you know, casual friends. I worked with him at Meta, you know, he is the chief scientist\nat Meta for a long time and is still, you know, works with us. And obviously is a legendary\nfigure in the field and one of the main people\nresponsible for what's happening. My serious observation would be that it's the thing I keep,\nI've talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does\nis he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree\nwith this, he is the smartest and most credible critic\nof LLMs is the path for AI. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's not, you know, there's certain, I would say troll-like characters who are just like crapping everything. But like Yann has like very\ndeeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. And I actually, like,\nI try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,\nI try to have a mental model of like the two different\nsides of a serious argument. And so I've tried to like\ninternalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult 'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like\nthat could be a big problem. But like, we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the\nbullish people, you know, to really kind of test\ntheir level of knowledge. So I like to kind of grill people. Like, you know, I was got\nmy CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like to the extent I can\nunderstand Yann's points, I can use them to, you know,\nto really surface a lot of the questions for the\npeople who are more bullish. And that's been, I think,\nvery, very productive. Yeah, just, and it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, who is actually like a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he\nwill provoke the evolution of these systems to be much\nbetter than they would've been. - Yeah, he could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the\nLLM path to AGI, you know, his basic notions that\nthere needs AI needs to have some physical understanding\nof the physical world, and that's very difficult\nto achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations\nof LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source.\n- Yes. - Which is a whole nother-\n- Yes. - Which you have been as well. - [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah. - And that's been just\nfascinating to watch. - [Marc] And anti-doomer. - Anti-doomer?\n- Yeah. - Yeah, he's-\n- He's very anti-doomer. - He embodies... He also has many wolves inside. - [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes, he does. Yes, does. - So it's been really,\nreally fun to watch. - The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. - [Lex] Yeah. - The other two of the\nthree godfathers of AI are like radicals, like full-on left, you know,\nfar left, you know, like, I would say like either\nMarxists or borderline Marxists. And they're like, I think, quite extreme in\ntheir social political views. And I think that feeds\ninto their doomerism, and I think, you know, they are lobbying for\nlike draconian government, I think what would be ruinously\ndestructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Yann as a\ncounterpoint to those two. - Another fun question, our\nmutual friend Andrew Huberman. - [Marc] Yes. - First maybe, what do you\nlove most about Andrew? And second, what score\non a scale of 1 to 10 do you think he would give you\non your approach to health? - Oh, three. - Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.\n- (laughs) Exactly. - That's good. (laughs)\n- Exactly. Well, so he convinced me\nto stop drinking alcohol, which was a big-\n- Successfully? - Well, it was like other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world.\n- Yeah. - And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night, it was like a major, like, it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly\nnegatively impacted my emotional health. (Lex laughing) I blame him-\n- Yeah. - For making me much\nless happy as a person. But much, much, much healthier. - Yeah.\n- Physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have no interest in\nhis sleep shit. Like, no. This whole light, natural light, no, we're not doing it. - You're too hardcore for this? - I don't see any natural light in here. - [Lex] It's all covered. It's all horrible. - And I'm very happy. I would be very happy\nliving and working here 'cause I'm totally happy\nwithout natural light. - In darkness.\n- Yes. - It must be a metaphor for something. - Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have\na blue screen in your face for three hours and\nthen go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why you should wanna take shortcuts. - I now understand what they\nmean by toxic masculinity. All right. (both laughing) So let's see. You're exceptionally\nsuccessful by most measures, but what to you is the\ndefinition of success? - I would probably say it is\na combination of two things, I think it is contribution. So, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately, you know, and specifically\nit mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not\nmean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said, \"Pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to\nsatisfaction or fulfillment. And so I think about happiness as the first ice cream\ncone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice\ncream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of\nthe walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Right, and so happiness is\nthis very fleeting concept, and the people who\nanchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I dunno how to put it useful. - So that's a good place\nto arrive at in life. - Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah. You know, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But like, if you're sitting in a room by yourself and you're like, all right. Or you know, four in the\nmorning, it's like, all right, have I lived up to my\nexpectation of myself? Like if you have, you know,\nthe people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and, you know, generally seem\nvery, I dunno how to put it, pleased with, you know,\nproud, calm, at peace. The people who are, you\nknow, sensation seekers, you know, some of the sensations\nby the way, some sense, you know, there's certain\nentrepreneurs, for example, who are like into every\nform of extreme sport and they get, you know, huge\nsatisfaction out of that. Or, you know, there's sensation seeking in sort of useful and productive ways. You know, Larry Ellison\nwas always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, there's\na lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know,\ndrugs, (laughs) you know, like you know, sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun\nat first and then backfire. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM- - [Marc] Yeah.\n- And I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM- - Yeah.\n- With a blue screen. - That's good. Exactly. - Staring at cursor.\n- Exactly. - As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an\namazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and\njust to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called,\n\"Honestly, with Bari Weiss.\" She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys... See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. - [Marc] Thank you. - So this question is designed for many of the questions today\nwere designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause\nthat you're not sure. So it felt like the\npause, the uncertainty, there was some kind of\nongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching\nfor wisdom and meaning? - I guess I'd put it this way. There's a lot to just\nunderstand about people that I feel like I'm only\nstarting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler\nconcept than God. (laughs) So that's what I've spent a\nlot of the last, you know, 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my\nfirst like whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I'm spending 30\nyears figuring out people, which turns out to be quite\na bit more complicated. And then, I don't know,\nmaybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look,\nI mean just, you know, like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is like\nvery, you know, complicated and, you know, mystifying. I mean, every time I, you\nknow, pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, you know, \"Daddy, how many galaxies\nare there in the universe?\" And you know, how many galaxies are\nthere in the universe? - 100 billion?\n- Okay. Like how? (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - Like-\n- Yeah. - Like how that freaking possible? Like it's such a\nstaggering concept that I- - I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from\nElon from a while back. Elon, said, \"As a friend called it, this\nis the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies, a billion light years across.\"\n- Yeah. - So these are all galaxies.\n- Yeah. Like how was it that big? Like how the hell, and like, you know, I can read the textbook\nand the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion\nyears and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all\nrights, the Big Bang. All right, like what was\nbefore the Big Bang? (laughs) - Do you think we humans will\never colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? - Sure. Yeah, I mean,\nin the fullness of time. Yeah. - So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across a thousand of-\n- In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah, you know, all the problem, all the\nchallenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it'll take a long time. - You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? - No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately\nwe have Elon giving us, (Lex laughing) giving us the backup plan. So I don't know, like,\nI grew up, you know, real Midwest, sort of\njust like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an\nengineer and a scientist. I'm like, \"Oh, that definitely\ndoesn't make sense.\" I'm like, \"I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll figure everything out.\" And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against\nthese things, you know, you bump up against these things and you're just like, \"All right,\" I like, \"Okay, I guess there's\na scientific explanation for this, but like, wow.\" And then there's like, \"All right, where did that come from?\" Right, and then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean,\nand even just, you know, experiences that we all have on earth, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, I guess I just say I'm kind\nof radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that\nI'll probably never know. The other thing though, that's happened, and maybe the more practical\nanswer to the question is I think I have a much\nbetter understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great... I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, \"If a man does\nnot have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\" And so there's this class,\nit's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing\npoint of view, which is, \"Yes, I'm an atheist,\nbut it's very important that the people believe in something.\" Right? And Marx had like the\nnegative view on that, which is religions the\nopiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like\nright-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it's deeply important that the people be Christian\nor something like that. And on the one hand it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right because, you know, what have we learned in the last 100 years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's\nthis political philosopher who's super interesting on\nthis named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the sort\nof mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was like born in, I think, like 1900, and like died in like '85. So he saw the complete run\nof communism and Nazism and himself, you know, I think he fled Europe and\nyou know, the whole thing. And you know, his sort of\nbig conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but like in the deep way of religions. Like, you know, we call\n'em political religions, but they were like actual religions. And you know, they were\nwhat Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, \"God is dead. We've killed him, and we won't\nwash the blood off our hands for 1,000 years,\" right? Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just\nmass murder and death. And like, you read his stuff now and you're like, \"Yep,\n(laughs) that happened.\" Right? And then, of\ncourse, as fully, you know, elite moderates, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing\nthat for ourselves right now, but of course, we are. And you know, I would argue\nthat Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the\nlast 10 years, you know, we have been in a\nreligious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full\nscale religious frenzy and has had all of the\ncharacteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to, you know, sin. Wokeness has said, every, I think, has said every single aspect of an actual religion other\nthan redemption, right? Which is maybe like the\nmost dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's\nno forgiveness, right? And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would've\nzeroed right in on that, would've said that. And, you know, we just\nlike sailed right off. I mentioned earlier like\nwe somehow rediscovered the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity\npolitics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, like there is\nsomething very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and\nneeds to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles\nwith the specifics of it. - I think I speak for a lot of people that it's been a real joy and for me, an honor to get to\nwatch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You're in that 30-year part of your life, and it's been an honor\nto talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That's only, how long is that? - Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so- - I'll accept being one of the short ones. (both laughing) - For the listener. Marc looks like he's ready\nto go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. (laughs) Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Thomas Sowell. \"It takes considerable knowledge\njust to realize the extent of your own ignorance.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time.",

    "title": "The Future of Prediction Market: A Web3 Social Media Revolution | annotated by vitali",
    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

And then if this doesn't\nget fixed, at some point, we enter a hyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil and- - The following is a conversation\nwith Marc Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. Marc is a visionary\ntech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the\ntech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential\nvoices in the tech world, including at the intersection\nof technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the\nbest possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small\ntech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario\ntrajectory for America. - The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.\n- The roaring '20s. I mean, look, couple things. It is remarkable over\nthe last several years with all of the issues\nincluding, you know, not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every\nother thing that's happened. It's really amazing, the United\nStates just kept growing. If you just look at\neconomic growth charts, the US just kept growing,\nand very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing,\nGermany has stopped growing, and you know, some of those countries may be actually growing\nbackwards at this point. And there's a very long\ndiscussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's of course, plenty of things that are\nwrong with our country, but the US is just flat\nout primed for growth. And I think that's a consequence\nof many factors, you know, some of which are lucky and\nsome of which through hard work. And so the lucky part is\njust, you know, number one, you know, we just have like\nincredible physical security by being our own continent. You know, we have incredible\nnatural resources, right? There's this running joke now that like, whenever it looks like\nthe US is gonna run out of some like rare earth\nmaterial, you know, some farmer in North Dakota\nlike kicks over a hay bale and finds like a $2 trillion deposit. Right, I mean, we're just like blessed, you know, with geography\nand with natural resources. Energy. You know, we can be energy\nindependent anytime we want. This last administration\ndecided they didn't wanna be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has\ndeclared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There's no question we\ncan be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It's purely a question of choice, and I think the new\nadministration's gonna do that. And oh, and then I would\nsay two other things. One is, you know, we\nare the beneficiaries, and, you know, you're an example of this. We're a beneficiary. We're the beneficiary of,\nyou know, 50, 100, 200 years of like the basically\nmost aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people, you know, moving to the US and\nraising their kids here. And so we just have, you know, we're by far the\nmost dynamic population, most aggressive. You know, we're the most\naggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country, and have been for a long\ntime, and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the\nadvanced technology leader. You know, we have our\nissues and we have a... I would say particular\nissue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for, you know, anything\nin software, anything in AI, anything in, you know,\nall these, you know, advanced biotech, all these\nadvanced areas of technology, like we're by far the leader. Again, in part 'cause many\nof the best scientists and engineers in those fields, you know, come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for a just a monster boom. You know, I could see\neconomic growth going way up. I could see productivity\ngrowth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a\nglobal tour, if you like, but like, basically, all of our competitors\nhave like profound issues and, you know, we could kind\nof go through them one by one, but the competitive\nlandscape just is, it's like, it's remarkable how much better positioned\nwe are for growth. - What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical questions. You know, I travel across the world and there's something\nabout the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be\nthe Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? - Yeah. So is this a family\nshow or am I allowed to swear? - You could say whatever\nthe fuck you want. - (laughs) Okay. So the great TV show, \"Succession,\" the show, of course, which\nyou were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.\n- Yes. - The best line from \"Succession\"\nwas in the final episode of the first season\nwhen the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral\nhomeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle,\nyou know, for some wedding. And Logan is just like\ncompletely miserable, have to having to, you know, 'cause he is been in\nNew York for 50 years, he's totally miserable\nbeing back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here and go back to America where\nwe can fuck without condoms.\" (both laughing) - Was that a metaphor or... Okay.\n- Exactly. Right. And so no, but it's exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what, like-\n- Yeah. - Everybody watching that\ninstantly starts laughing 'cause you know what it means,\nwhich it's exactly this. I think there's like an\nethnographic, you know, way of it. There's a bunch of\nbooks on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all\nthe different derivations of all the different ethnic\ngroups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. Right, and what we have is\nthis sort of amalgamation of like, you know, the\nNortheast, you know, Yankees who are like super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are\nsuper aggressive, you know, we've got the, you know, the Southerners and the Texans, you know, and you know, the sort of, you\nknow, whole kind of blended, you know, kind of\nAnglo-Hispanic thing, you know, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, you know, capable characters. You know, the Texas Rangers,\nyou know, we've got the, yeah, we've got the California, you\nknow, we've got the, you know, the wild, we've got the\nincredibly, you know, inventive hippies, but we also\nhave the hardcore engineers. We've got, you know, the best, you know, rocket scientists in the world. We've got the best, you\nknow, artists in the world, you know, creative professionals,\nyou know, the best movies. And so yeah, there is, you know, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, you\nknow, in my view to some extent, you know, attempts to\nbasically sand all that off and make everything basically\nboring and mediocre. But there is something\nin the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just\nneed people to stand up at a certain point and say, you know, \"It's time to build, it's time to grow, you know,\nit's time to do things.\" And there's something\nin the American spirit that just like roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I actually saw, you know, I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s, you know, 'cause the '70s were like horribly depressing, right? In the US. Like they were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has\nfelt a lot like the '70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating,\nyou know, negative attitude and everybody's upset about everything. And, you know, and then by\nthe way, like energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization, right? You know, the low point for\nin the '70s was, you know, Jimmy Carter who just passed away. He went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech. And it was like the weakest possible, trying to like rouse people\nback to a sense of like passion, he completely failed. And, you\nknow, we had the, you know, the hostages in, you know,\nIran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly\nnews, it was, you know, lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then, you know, Reagan came in and, you know, Reagan was a\nvery controversial character at the time, and, you know, he came in\nand he is like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're gonna do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and, you know, roared really\nhard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what... I think, you know, we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. - And I just did a super long\npodcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible\nprofessor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic.\n- Yes. - And one of which maybe\nyou can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual\nfreedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just\nin general, individualism. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and as you know this, America has this incredible\nstreak of individualism, you know, individualism in\nAmerica probably peaked, I think between roughly call\nit the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably\ncall it 1931 or something, you know, and there was\nthis like incredible rush. I mean, that period, you know, we now know that period as the\nSecond Industrial Revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then, you know, that led to, you know, ultimately then therefore\nbeing able to, you know, not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II\nand then win the Cold War. And yeah, you know, massive\nindividualistic streak. By the way, you know,\nMilton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring.\n- Yep. - As they were then, you know, he is a singular figure and many of us, you\nknow, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of\npeople who worked with him and you know, he was a singular figure, but all of his lessons, you know, live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's\nnot just individualism, and this is, you know, this\nis one of the big things, it's like playing out\nin a lot of our culture and kind of political fights\nright now, which is, you know, basically this feeling, you\nknow, certainly that I have and I share with a lot\nof people, which is, it's not enough for America\nto just be an economic zone. And it's not enough for\nus to just be individuals, and it's not enough to\njust have line go up, and it's not enough to\njust have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also, you know,\nthere's more to a country than just that. And you know, quite frankly,\na lot of it is intangible. A lot of it is, you know,\ninvolve spirit and passion. And you know, like I said, we have more of it than\nanybody else, but, you know, we have to choose to want it. The way I look at, it's\nlike all of our problems are self-inflicted. Like, you know, decline is a choice. You know, all of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, you know, basically people telling us, people in positions of\nauthority telling us that, you know, \"We shouldn't,\nyou know, stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous,\nwe shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, you know, we shouldn't this,\nthat, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about\neverything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think\npeople are done with it. - If we could go on a\ntangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book \"The Ancient City.\"\n- Yes. - By, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa\nDenis Fustel de Coulanges, I don't know. - That was amazing. - Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said, this is an\nimportant book to understand who we are and where we come from. - So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by\nthis guy as a (indistinct). I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language\npronunciations for the day. He was a professor classics\nat the Sorbonne in Paris, you know, the top university,\nactually in the 1860s, so actually, right around\nafter the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a\nparticular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the\nbook as he had apparently read, and, you know, sort of absorbed and memorized every\npossible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about\nGreek and Roman culture, and that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none\nof that has changed, right? And so he had access to the\nexact same written materials that we have access to, and you know, we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he\ndid is he went back further. He reconstructed the people\nwho came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their\nlife and society was like. And these were the\npeople who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you\nmay have heard of these are the people who came\ndown from the steppes. And so they came out of what's\nnow like Eastern Europe, like around sort of the\noutskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of\nswept through Europe. They ultimately took over\nall of Europe, by the way, you know, almost many of the\nethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years\nthat follow, you know, are Indo-European. And so like, you know, they were this basically this warrior, basically class that like\ncame down and swept through and you know, essentially, you know, populated much of the world. And there's a whole\ninteresting saga there. But what he does, and then they basically, from there came basically\nwhat we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind\nof evolutions off of that. And so what he reconstructs\na sort of what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind\nof original social state. And the significance of that\nis the original social state is this is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no\ntechnology, (laughs) right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got the clothes on your back, you've got your, you know, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you know, predates\nbasically all concepts of technologies as we\nunderstand 'em today. And so these are people\nunder like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social\npatterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern\nbasically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero\nconcept of individual rights and essentially no\nconcept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set\nof tribes would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what\nNietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality,\nanything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it's very clear why that is, right? It's 'cause strong equals\ngood equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is it more important\nfor you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, you know, live as a slave on your\nknees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted\nthat moral framework. But it, you know, the\noriginal framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally\nobligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. (laughs) Right, you were morally required to. Like, if you didn't do\nit, you were a bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time\nwith no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives\nis that it's a collective you know, and people are\nsharing and of course, that limited how big they could get 'cause you know, the\nproblem with communism is it doesn't scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it\nwork at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately\ntied into their religion. And their religion was,\nit was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors\nis extremely important because it was basically the\nancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the\npeople who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of nature 'cause of course, nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city\nhad their ancestor gods, and then they had their nature gods. Okay, so fast-forward to today, like we live in a world that\nis like radically different, and the book takes you\nthrough kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans, through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because\nthe conventional view of the progress through time\nis that we are, you know, the cliche is the arc of the\nmoral universe, you know, bend towards justice, right? Or so-called wig history,\nwhich is, you know, that the arc of progress\nis positive, right? And so, you know, what\nyou hear all the time, what you're taught in school\nand everything is, you know, every year that goes by,\nwe get better and better and more and more moral\nand more and more pure and a better version of ourselves, our Indo-European ancestors would say, \"Oh, no, like you people\nhave like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically your civilization, and you have diluted\nthem down to the point where they barely even matter. You know, and you're having, you know, children outta a wedlock and you're, you know, you\nregularly encounter people of other cities and you\ndon't try to kill them.\" And like, how crazy is that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an\nincredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious,\nhighly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can't resist noting\nthat as a consequence of basically going through\nall the transitions we've been through, going all the way through\nChristianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We're in a secular society,\nyou know, that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but you know, largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved,\nmodern secular, you know, expert, scientists and so\nforth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact\nsame religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had,\nspecifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics\nand nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, worked our way all the way\nback to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show\nthat like, you know, in some ways we have fallen\nfar from the family tree, but in some cases, we're exactly the same. - You kind of described this\nprogressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. - Identity politics is\nworshiping ancestors, right?\n- Yeah. - It's tagging newborn\ninfants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've\nrecognized it on sight. We somehow think it's like\nsuper socially progressive. - Yeah. And it is not. - I mean, I would say obviously not. You know, get nuanced, which\nis where I think you're headed, which is look like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent\nsociety every generation, and have no regard whatsoever\nfor what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea, right? That's like the Cambodians\nwith Year Zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up\neverything that came before and create something new\nin the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing, you know,\nenormous destruction. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, there is like a deeply\nimportant role for tradition. And the way I think\nabout that is the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And you know, this is what\nIndo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled\nwisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and\npowerful lessons learned. And that's why I think\nit's fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is 'cause that's part of the history and you know, part of the learning that got us to where we're today. Having said that, there are\nmany cultures around the world that are, you know, mired\nin tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that's the default human\ncondition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in\nsocieties in which, you know, there's like absolute\nseniority by age, you know, kids are completely... You know, like in the\nUS, like for some reason, we decided kids are in\ncharge of everything, right? And like, you know,\nthey're the trendsetters and they're allowed to\nlike, set all the agendas and like set all the politics\nand set all the culture and maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. 'Cause it's the old\npeople who are in charge of everything, you know,\nthey're gerontocracies, and it's all a bunch of\n80-year-olds running everything, which by the way, we have a\nlittle bit of that too, right? And so what I would say is like, there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is\ncommunitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you\nknow, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, I mean, it just\ndoesn't get you anywhere. Like, it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a society living\nin the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in\nall the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, you know, I think it probably, this is one of those things\nwhere extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. - So the beautiful picture you\npainted of the roaring '20s, how can the Trump\nadministration play a part in making that future happen? - Yeah, so look, a big part of this is getting the government\nboot off the neck of the American economy, the\nAmerican technology industry, the American people. You know, and again, this\nis a replay of what happened in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know, for what started out looking\nlike, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you\nknow, we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I describe as sort of a\nform of soft authoritarianism. You know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's not like, you know, you\nget thrown into Lubyanka. You know, for the most part, it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know,\nincredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vetocracy, right? What's required to get anything done? You know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything,\nany one of them can veto it. You know, there's a lot of (indistinct)\npolitical system works. And then, you know, just this\ngeneral idea of, you know, progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses\nis bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome,\nyou know, basically anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. Anybody who's wrong\nabout anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this\nvery kind of, you know, grinding repression. And then coupled with\nspecific government actions such as censorship regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, you know, critical American industries and then, you know,\ncongratulating yourselves on the back for doing it, or, you know, having these\nhorrible social policies, like let's let all the\ncriminals outta jail and see what happens, right? And so, like we've just\nbeen through this period, you know, I call it a\ndemoralization campaign. Like we've just been through\nthis period where, you know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being\nthis comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible\nand if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration\nreached kinda the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many\nfronts at the same time. And so just like relieving that and getting kind of back\nto a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic,\nconstructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind,\nthere's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is gonna, I think,\ncause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of\nthings proactively that, yeah. And then there's a lot\nof things proactively that could be done. - So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically\npermeated government and permeated big companies? - Disclaimer at first, which is I don't wanna predict\nanything on any of this stuff 'cause I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics\nor Washington at all. But I would just say that\nthe plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration\nand that they plan to take, you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're gonna do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they're gonna do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they're gonna move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. Like, I mean, you know, we just saw a great example\nof this with what, you know, with what Mark Zuckerberg\nis doing, you know, and obviously I'm\ninvolved with his company, but you know, we just saw it\nkind of in public, the scope, and speed of the changes, you know, are reflective of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry, right? And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump\nor anti-Trump, like, there's just like a giant vibe shift mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a\ngroup of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still, you know, people who at least vocally\nwere still very anti-Trump, but I said, you know, \"Has anything changed since November 6th?\" And they immediately said, \"Oh, it's completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. You know, woke is over.\" You know, they said that\nall kinds of projects are gonna be able to get\nmade now they couldn't before that, you know, Hollywood's gonna start\nmaking comedies again. You know, like, they were just, just like an incredible\nimmediate environmental change. And as I talk to people kind\nof throughout, you know, certainly throughout the economy,\npeople who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which\nis just this last 10 years of misery is just over. I mean, the one that I'm\nwatching that's really funny. I mean, Facebook's getting a lot, Meta's getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is\nBlackRock, which I'm not, you know, and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so, you know, the Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock was like first in as a major, you know, investment CEO on like\nevery dumb social trend and rule set, like every... All right, I'm going for it.\nEvery retardant, (laughs) every retarded thing you can imagine.\n- Yeah. - Every ESG and every, like, every possible saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed\nideological positions. And, you know, he was coming\nin, he literally was like, had a aggregated together\ntrillions of dollars of shareholdings that he did not, you know, that were his customer's rights. And he, you know, seized\ntheir voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been like backpedaling\nfrom that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example, last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, you know, he pulled out\nof the crazy energy stuff. And so, like, you know, he's\nbacking away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard\nPryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where\nhe could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (Lex laughing) (laughs) And so, you know,\neven there doing that, and just the whole thing, I mean this, I dunno if you saw the court\nrecently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of\ndirectors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel\nand I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional\nattorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight\nface that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who\nliterally wrote a book called \"The Diversity Myth.\"\n- Yeah. - And he literally looked\nlike he'd swallowed a live goldfish and that-\n- Yeah. - And this was imposed, I mean, this was like so\nincredibly offensive to him that like, it was just\nabsolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (Lex laughing) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange\nimposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that, you know, so like these things basically are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other\nside of it is basically, you know, finally being able\nto get back to, you know, everything that, you know,\neverybody always wanted to do, which is like, run their\ncompanies, have great products, have happy customers,\nyou know, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society. - It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. - Well, so it was very, you\nknow, there was a moment. So you know, Peter, of course, you know, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but you know, there are other\nmen on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it,\nand we're like, all right, like, okay, LGBT, and we keep\ncoming back to the B, right? And it's like- (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - You know, it's like-\n- All right. - You know, I'm willing to do\na lot for this company, but- (both laughing) - It's all about sacrifice for diversity. - Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay,\nlike is there a test? - Right.\n- Right. You know, so.\n(Lex laughing) - Oh, yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? - [Marc] The questions\nthat got asked, you know. - What are you willing to do-\n- Yeah, and- - The greater good? - I've become very good at asking lawyers\ncompletely absurd questions with a totally straight face. - And do they answer with a\nstraight face, like lawyers- - Sometimes.\n- Okay. - I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. - So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon\nValley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to\npreference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? Like what percent of them\nare feeling this vibe shift and are interested in\ncreating the roaring '20s in the way they've described? - So first, we should\nmaybe talk population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley and the way to just measure that is just look at\nvoting records, right? And what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically, my entire time there has\nbeen overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that\nis political donation records. And again, you know,\nthe political donations in the Valley, you know,\nrange from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. And so, you know, I just\nbring it up 'cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there\nis a very big question of what's happening in\nLos Angeles right now. I don't wanna get into the fire, but like, it's catastrophic. And, you know, there was\nalready a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people\nin LA are really thinking about things right now as\nthey're trying to, you know, literally save their houses\nand save their families. But, you know, even in San Francisco, you know, there was a big shift\nto the right in the voting in '24. So, we'll see where\nthat goes, but you know, you observe that by just looking\nat the numbers over time. The part that I'm more\nfocused on is, you know, and I don't know how to\nexactly describe this, but it's like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people, right? You know, and I don't have a list, but like, you know, it's\nall the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top\nengineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, you know, the people who kind of\nbuilt and run the companies. And they're, you know,\nI don't have numbers, but I have a much more\ntactile feel, you know, for what's happening. So the big thing I have\nnow come to believe is that the idea that people\nhave beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most\nhigh-status people just go along. And I think maybe the\nmost high-status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the\nmost focused on status. And the way I would\ndescribe that is, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the\nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely\ninteresting articulation. You know, he was an\ninsane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. (both laughing) But-\n- Shots fired, man. - But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing\nwhere he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that's just stuck in my\nmind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept, you just called over-socialization. And so, you know, most\npeople are socialized, like most people are, you\nknow, we live in a society, most people learn how\nto be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There's something about\nmodern Western elites where they're over-socialized and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, you know, think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little\nbit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence\nof where I grew up. Like even before I had the\nviews that I have today, there was always just this\nweird thing where it's like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree\non every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in The New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? (laughs) Right? But why does everybody like\nsnap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I\ncame to Silicon Valley, and it's just as true\ntoday 30 years later. And so I think most\npeople are just literally, I think they're taking their cues from, it's some combination of\nthe press, the universities, the big foundations. So basically, it's like\nThe New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and you know, I don't\nknow, you know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and you know, maybe the President if\nyour party is in power. And like, whatever that is, everybody who's sort of\ngood and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the\ntwo interesting things about that is, number one, there's no divergence among\nthe organs of power, right? So Harvard and Yale believed\nthe exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believed the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and\nthe Rockefeller Foundation believed the exact same thing. Google, and, you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believed the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there's never conflict\nin the moment, right? And so, you know, The New York Times and The Washington Post\nagreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the\nspecifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically, we in the valley, we're\non the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood's\non the tail end of that, in the same way New York's\non the tail end of that, the same way the media's\non the tail end of that. It's like some sort of\ncollective hive mind thing. And I just go through that to say like, I don't think most people in my orbit, or you know, let's say the top\n10,000 people in the Valley, or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're sitting\nthere thinking basically, I have rocks... I mean, they probably think\nthey have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core\nof rocks solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch\nreality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they\nconform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time, they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd. - Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that, there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking to\npeople really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens\nat the dinner parties? Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four\npeople who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the\nmind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention\nwithin New York Times with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that\novertook Marc Andreessen's face. - So look, I'll just\ntell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences,\nno, there's none of that. What there is that all of the\nheretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation is either\ndiscussed a one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real-life social network. There's a secret handshake,\nwhich is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like\nknow each other a little bit, but like not well. And like you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to\nthe other person openly or whether you have to\nlike be fully conformist. It's a joke. - Well, yeah, humor- - [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke.\n- Yep. - If the other person laughs,\nthe conversation is on. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - If the other person doesn't laugh, back slowly away from the scene, (laughs) I didn't mean anything by it. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then by the way, it\ndoesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke\nthat's just up against the edge of one of the, use the\nSam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. You know, it has to be up\nagainst one of the things, you know, one of the things\nthat you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point,\nwhat happens is you have a peer-to-peer network, right? You have a one-to-one\nconnection with somebody, and then you have your own, your little conspiracy\nof a thought criminality, and then you've probably\nbeen through this, you have your network\nof thought criminals, and then they have their\nnetwork of thought criminals, and then you have this\nlike delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together, right? - And the fundamental mechanism\nof the dance is humor. - Yeah, it's humor like it, right? Well, of course.\n- Memes. Yeah. - Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor's a way\nto have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss\nserious thing without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right? So that's part of it, which is one of the reasons\nwhy comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can't. 'Cause, you know, they\ncan always fall back on, oh, yeah, I was just going for the laugh.\n- Yeah. - But the other key\nthing about humor, right? Is that laughter's involuntary, right? Like, you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision whether you're gonna laugh. And everybody can tell when\nsomebody's fake laughing, right? And this, every professional\ncomedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something truthful. Like, people don't laugh at\nlike, made-up bullshit stories. They laugh 'cause like\nyou're revealing something that they either have not\nbeen allowed to think about or have not been allowed\nto talk about, right? Or is off limits. And all of a sudden,\nit's like the ice breaks and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny and like I laugh, and then, of course,\nthis is why, of course, live comedy is so powerful is 'cause you're all doing\nthat at the same time, so you start to have, you\nknow, the safety of numbers. And so the comedians have like the all, it's no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has\nbeen as successful as he has 'cause they have this\nhack that the, you know, the rest of us who are\nnot professional comedians don't have, but you have\nyour in-person version of it. Yeah, and then you've got the question of whether you can sort of\njoin the networks together. And then you've probably\nbeen to this is, you know, then at some point\nthere's like a different, there's like the alt dinner party, the (indistinct) dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are like the happiest\nmoments of everybody's lives, 'cause they're just like,\neverybody's just ecstatic, 'cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed, like for every third sentence that comes outta my mouth, and we can actually\ntalk about real things. So that's the live version of it. And then, of course, the other\nside of it's the, you know, the group chat phenomenon, right? And then basically the same\nthing played out, you know, until Elon bought X and until\nSubstack took off, you know, which were really the\ntwo big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute\nconformity on the social networks, like literally enforced by\nthe social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through\ncancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming, right? But then group chats grew\nup to be the equivalent of samizdat, right? Anybody who grew up in the\nSoviet Union under, you know, communism, note, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It is like, how do you\nknow who you could talk to? And then how do you\ndistribute information? And like, you know, again, that was the hard\nauthoritarian version of this. And then we've been living\nthrough this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, with\nsome of the same patterns. - And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient\nto build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. - Yeah, exactly. Well,\nand this is the thing, and well, this is kind of the running joke about groups, right? The running kind of\nthing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, every group chat, if you've noticed this like, this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up\nbeing about memes and humor. And the game of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable. - [Lex] Yeah. - As you can get without\nactually tripping it, right? And like literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest\nwhere, but it's walking, they walk right up the line\nand they're constantly testing. And every once in a while\nsomebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, \"Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, we gotta wait until\nnext year to talk about that.\" You know, they walk it back. And so it's that same thing, and yeah. And then group chats is a\ntechnological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. 'Cause basically, it was number one, it was, you know, obviously\nthe rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of\nthe new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination\nof WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is\nthose were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough, I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably\nfour or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages,\nI think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of the\ndisappearing messages, right? And so it's like, you know, I\noften get behind on my thing, so I set to seven-day, you\nknow, disappearing messages and my friends who, you know, are like, no, that's way too much risk. - Yeah.\n- It's gotta be a day. And then every once in a\nwhile somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something\nlike particularly inflammatory. - Yeah, 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that\nbothers me about WhatsApp, the choices between 24 hours\nand, you know, seven days, one day or seven days.\n- (laughs) Right. - And I have to have an existential crisis about deciding.\n- Yes. - Whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Now, of course,\nwhat's happening right now is the big thaw, right? And so the vibe shift. So what's happening on the\nother side of the election is, you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the\ncontinued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new\nplatforms that are emerging. You know, like I think\nit may be, you know, I don't know that everything\njust shifts back into public, but like a tremendous amount\nof the verboten conversations, you know, can now shifts\nback into public view. And I mean, quite frankly,\nthis is one of those things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those, you know, what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like\nnet better for society that those things happen in\npublic instead of private. You know, do you really want, like, yeah. Like does she wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it's just, look, it's just I think,\nclearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. - I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea\nthat we're talking about. I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction\nof people have that? To me, the preference falsification\nis really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? 'Cause like that the dynamical system that is the difference between\nthose two is fascinating. Like, throughout history, the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting, 'cause everybody was following, you know, the line until not.\n- Right. - But for sure, privately,\nthere was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where like this is the\nbureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really\nbothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden, there's a trigger that allows\nthe vibe shift to happen. To me, like the interesting\nquestion here is, what is the landscape of\nprivate thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how\nmuch dormant energy is there for this roaring '20s? What people are like, no more\nbullshit, let's get shit done. - Yeah, so we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- - [Lex] Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly, this is one\nof the all-time great books. Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book, but it's completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply\nhistorically informed. So it's called \"Private\nTruths, Public Lies.\" And it's written by a social science\nprofessor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his\na definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls preference falsification. And so preference\nfalsification is two things, preference falsification... And you get it from the title of the book, \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So preference falsification\nis when you believe something and you can't say it, or/and this is very important,\nyou don't believe something and you must say it, right? And the commonality there is\nin both cases, you're lying. You believe something internally, and then you're lying about it in public. And so the thing, you know, and there's sort of the\ntwo classic forms of it. There's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe\ncommunism is rotten, but I can't say it version of it. But then there's also the famous parable of the real-life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good\nbook on this topic, which is \"The Power of the Powerless,\" you know, who is an\nanti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the, you know, the president Czechoslovakia\nafter the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book, and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of\nthe world unite, right? And so he describes what he calls the parable of the greengrocer, which is your greengrocer\nin Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been... 50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your story that says, \"Workers of\nthe world, unite,\" right? And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear\nthat the workers of the world are not going to unite. (laughs) Like of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been\nat that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be\nin your window every morning, because if it's not in\nyour window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are gonna come by and they're gonna get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays\nin the window all day long. But he says, the thing\nis, every single person, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the slogan knows that it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the store knows that the greengrocer is\nonly putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to\ngo through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the\nsystem and lying in public. And so it turns into\ndemoralization campaign. In fact, it's not ideological\nenforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake, everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're\nenforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they are\nenforcing compliance, right? And compliance with the regime. And fuck you, you will comply, right? And so anyway, that's\nthe other side of that. And of course, we have\nlived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening\nto this could name a series of slogans that\nwe've all been forced to chant for the last decade, that everybody knows at\nthis point are just like, simply not true. I'll let the audience, you know, speculate on their own group chats. (both laughing) - Send Marc your memes\nonline as well, please. - Yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so anyway, so it's the\ntwo sides of that, right? So it's \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending\nthat from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire\nsociety experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages\nquestion, which is like, okay, what happens in a society\nin which people are forced to lie in public about\nwhat they truly believe? What happens number one\nis that individually they're lying in public, and that's bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have\nan accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how\nmany people agree with them. And this is how you, and\nagain, this literally is like how you get something\nlike the communist system, which is like, okay, you\nend up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be\nwilling to go along with it, but I'm not gonna be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the people who agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a\nmovement, you're gonna get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're gonna win the revolution, right? And so the question of like\nwhat the percentage actually is like a really critical question. And then, basically, in any\nsort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know\nuntil you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put at\nthe test in the same way. This is exactly what's happened\nfor the last two years, like 100% of exactly what's happened. It's like straight outta this book, which is somebody, Elon,\nsticks his hand up (laughs) and says, \"The workers of the\nworld are not going to unite.\" - Yeah.\n- Right. Or the emperor is actually\nwearing no clothes, right? You know that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is\nstanding there by themselves, and everybody else in\nthe audience is like, \"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna\nhappen to that guy,\" right? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn't know, the\nfirst guy doesn't know, other people don't know, like,\nwhich way is this gonna go? And it may be that's a minority position and that's the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that's a majority position and you are now the\nleader of a revolution. And then basically, of\ncourse, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that\ndoesn't get killed, (laughs) the second guy does... Well, a lot of the time\nthat guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn't get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing, all right? Now, you've got two. Two leads to four, four leads\nto eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia\nand Eastern Europe in '89, when it goes, it can go, right? And then it rips. And then what happens\nis very, very quickly, if it turns out that you\nhad a large percentage of the population that actually believed\nthe different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, \"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority.\" And at that point, like you\nwere on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. Right, now. The other part of this is the distinction between the role of the\nelites and the masses. And here the best book is called \"The True Believer,\" which\nis the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this 'cause the elites do idea\nformation and communication. But the elites, by definition\nare a small minority. And so there's also this giant\nrole played by the masses, and the masses are not\nnecessarily thinking these things through in the same\nintellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure\nexperiencing these things in their daily lives,\nand they for sure have at least very strong\nemotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the\nelites lined up with, or either the current elites change or a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually\na different better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the, you know, to\nfollow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is\nalso happening right now. And again, case study\none of that would be Elon and you know, who turns out, you know, in truly massive following. - And he has done that over and over in different industries, not\njust saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit\nin the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. - Yeah. And it's like, well,\nbut then there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, and this is where, you know, there are many specific\nthings about Elon's genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit,\nbut in his mind it's true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else. He's not right all the time. But at least my through\nline with him both in what he says in public and\nwhat he says in private, which by the way are\nthe exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about\nwhat he believes in private, or at least he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's 100% consistent\nin my experience. By the way, there's two guys who are 100% consistent like that I know. Elon and Trump. (both laughing) - Yeah.\n- Whatever you think of them. - [Lex] Yeah. - What they say in\nprivate is 100% identical to what they say in public. Like, they're completely transparent, they're completely honest\nin that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful\nleaders of these movements, 'cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost\neveryone else actually believes, but nobody was actually\nwilling to say out loud. And so they can actually\ncatalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this\nframework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party, as I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind\nof conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one\nwho was saying them. And so the again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes, like we're\ngoing this other direction. That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual\nmechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me\nthat we have been living through exactly this. We've been living through\neverything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav\nHavel described, (laughs) you know, Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've been living\nthrough the, you know, the true believer elites\nmasses, you know, thing with, you know, with a set of like\nbasically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the loyalty masses anymore, and a set of new elites that\nare running away with things. And so like, we're living through this like\nincredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a\nmoral of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really\nbad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they\nhave to do, you know, to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. - So one of the ways to avoid\nthat in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between\nwhat's said in private and what's said in public small. - Yeah. It's like, well, this\nis sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep\npeople from saying things, which means we can keep\npeople from thinking things. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know, by the way, that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean,\nagain, the hard form, you know, Soviet Union\nowning a mimeograph, pre-photocopiers, there\nwere mimeograph machines that were used to make samizdat\nand underground newspapers, which is the mechanism\nof written communication of radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death, right? So that's the hard version, right? You know, the soft version\nis somebody clicks a button in Washington and you are\nerased from the internet, right? Like, which, you know, good\nnews, you're still alive. Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your\nfamily now, you know, they hates you and won't\ntalk to you, but you know, you know, whatever the version\nof cancellation has been. And so like, does that work? Like maybe it works for a while, like it worked for the\nSoviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially\nwhen it was coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like\nincredible speed and ferocity. 'Cause to your point, there's\nall this bottled up energy. Now, your question was like,\nwhat are the percentages? Like what's the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. It's like you've got 20%, like true believers in\nwhatever is, you know, the current thing, you know, you got 20% of people who are just like\ntrue believers of whatever they, you know, whatever's\nin the new, like I say, whatever's in The New York\nTimes, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation,\nlike they're just believe. And by the way, maybe\nit's 10, maybe it's five, but let's say generously it's 20. So you know, 20% kind of\nfull-on revolutionaries. And then you've got, let's\ncall it 20% on the other side that are like, \"No, I'm\nnot on board with this. This is crazy. I'm not signing up for this.\" But, you know, they view themselves as they're in a small minority, and in fact, they start\nout in a small minority, 'cause what happens is the\n60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people. And it's not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying\nto go to work each day and do a good job and be a good\nperson and raise their kids and, you know, have a little\nbit of time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, political activism or any of this stuff. It's just not their thing. But that's where the over\nsocialization comes in, it's just like, okay, by\ndefault, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the\nradical revolutionaries, at least for a while. And then the counter elite\nis in this other 20%. And over time, they build\nup a theory and network and ability to resist and a\nnew set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's\na contest and then, right? And then the question is,\nwhat happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kinda my point, it's not even really does\nthe 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like,\nokay, what is the thing that 60% now decides to\nbasically fall into step with? And I think that, in the valley, that 60% for the last\ndecade decided to be woke and, you know, extremely, I would say, (laughs) on\nedge on a lot of things. And you know, that 60%\nis pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it. - And I would love to\nsee where that pivot goes 'cause there's internal battles\nhappening right now, right? - So this is the other thing, okay, so there's two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is, he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you're gonna have\nis you're now gonna have people in the other direction. You're\ngonna have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't, (laughs) right?\n- Right. - So it's gonna swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's\nnot the only part of this, but you know, he's just a\nconvenient shorthand for, you know, for a lot of this. But, you know, whatever it is, you'll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, right? Or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled\nthat person, right? Where of course, they were\nfull on a part of the mob, like, you know, kind of at\nthat moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference\nfalsification happening in the other direction. And his prediction, I think,\nbasically is you'll end up with the same quote,\n\"problem\" on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. You know, how far is American\nsociety willing to go on any of these things? I don't know. But like, there is some question there. And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this, you\nknow, elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those\npeople are still in power and they're in very, you\nknow, important positions. And The New York Times is\nstill The New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard. And like, those people haven't\nchanged like at all, right? And bureaucrats in the governments and, you know, senior democratic, you know, politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there, you know, right now feeling like reality\nhas just smacked them hard in the face 'cause they\nlost the election so badly. But they're now going into a, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War, right? And that form of the Civil\nWar is completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize\n'cause we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half\nof them are saying, \"No, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak, we were too soft. You know, we must become\nmore revolutionary. We must double down and we\nmust, you know, celebrate, you know, murders in the street of health insurance executives.\" And that right now is like a real fight. - If I could tell you\na little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a\nhistorian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking\nabout having a podcast, on doing a podcast. And he eventually said that,\n\"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I\njust don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are\nthe particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would\nsurprise a lot of people if I said who it is. You know, this is a\nperson who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80-plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Okay? Nevertheless, he just\ndoesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just\nhave a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk\nto your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are\nfeeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts,\nhow quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you\nmentioned 20, 60, 20 matters and the contents of the\nprivate groups matters, and the dynamics of how\nthat shifts matters. 'Cause it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. There's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these\nnew vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold. - Yeah. So he's a friend of yours, I respect that you don't wanna name him. I also respect you\ndon't wanna beat on him, so I would like to beat\non him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? - Yes. He should use it. - So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate\nindictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart\nof our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it's, by the way, it's\nlike across the board, it's like all the top universities. It's like, 'cause the\nsiren song for right? What it's been for 70 years,\nwhatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure\nsystem, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an\nacademic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what\nyou actually think, right? Then you can do your\nwork and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these\npeople have done to it. Like it's gone, like that entire thing was\nfake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely, completely giving up the\nentire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually\n100% by taxpayer money. - What's the inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this,\nwhat can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? - That the population at large is gonna realize the\ncorruption in their industry and it's going to withdraw the funding? - (laughs) It's okay. So desperation. (laughs)\n- No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next.\nOkay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources\nof federal funding. The big one is a federal\nstudent loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of\ndollars at this point. And then only spiraling, you know, way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know\nthat when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as\nmuch as 70% of the money for central uses. - [Lex] Yeah. - Number three is tax exemption\nat the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit\ninstitutions as opposed to, let's say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close\nto a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources\nof federal taxpayer money, and then for the state\nschools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild, 'cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at University of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed\nand I'm cheering for them, but the problem is, you're now inserting. Suppose you and I wanna\nstart a new university and we wanna hire all the\nfree thinking professors, and we wanna have the\nplace that fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. I'll give you the most direct reason, we can't get access to that money, we can't get access to\nfederal student funding. Do you know how\nuniversities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They're not accredited by\nthe Department of Education. Instead, what happens is, the Department of Education\naccredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that\ndo the accreditation. Guess what the composition of\nthe accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to\nfederal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic\nthey are about accrediting a new university? Right, and so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone... I mean, it's just obvious now. It's just gone like sideways in basically any possible\nway it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting beaten\nup on campus for being, you know, the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every\npossible way at this point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these\nthings without replacing them. And there's no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's\nlike everything in life. I mean, in a sense, this is\nlike the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when\na company does a bad job, is they go bankrupt and another company\ntakes its place, right? And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that\nis what happens is this is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? 'Cause things are tested and tried, and then you, you know, the things that are good survive. And so these places\nhave cut themselves off. They've been allowed to cut\nthemselves off from both, from evolution at the institutional level and evolution of the\nindividual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable\nin their current form. - I disagree with you on that. Maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can\nrevolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford\nand MIT are important. - Oh, but that logic\ndoesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. - Underpants gnome, can you\nexplain what that means? - Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started\nwatching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is \"South Park.\" - Yes.\n- And there is- - Wow. - And there is a, which by the way is a little\naggressive for a nine-year-old. - Very aggressive. - But he likes it. So he's learning all kinds of new words. - And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. - I told him, I said, \"You're\ngonna hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\" - Right. (laughs) Education. - And I said, \"You know\nhow we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I said, \"Not using a word that you learn in here\ndoes not count as lying.\" - [Lex] Wow.\n- \"And keep that in mind.\" - This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. - And of course, in the\nvery opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls\nthe other kid a dildo. Right, we're off to the races. - Yep. Let's go. - \"Daddy, what's a dildo?\" - [Lex] Yep. (both laughing) - So, you know, \"Sorry son, I don't know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So the-\n- Underpants gnome. - So famous episode of \"South\nPark,\" the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat... All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing the underpants. And it's just like, well,\nwho on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it's\nthe underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants\ngnomes that come to town and they've got this\nlittle underground warrant of tunnels in storage places\nfor all the underpants. And so they go out at night,\nthey steal the underpants, and the kids discover that, you\nknow, the underpants gnomes, and they're, you know,\n\"What are you doing? Like what's the point of this?\" And so the underpants gnomes\npresent their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit.\n- Yeah. - [Marc] Step two, question mark. (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So you just proposed the underpants gnome-\n- Yeah. - Which is very common in politics. Oh, so the form of this in politics is we must do something.\n- Yeah. - This is something,\ntherefore we must do this. But there's no causal logic chain in there at all to expect\nthat's actually gonna succeed 'cause there's no reason to believe that it is.\n- Yeah, but- - And it's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the\nhost of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I hear this, I have friends\nwho are on these boards, right?\n- Yeah. - Very involved in these places, and I hear this all the\ntime, which is like, \"Oh, these are very important. We must fix them.\" And so therefore, they're fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. - If there's that pressure\nthat you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty primary, fire a lot of the administration and realign and reinvigorate\nthis idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't... Because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is\naligned with this very idea that you're talking about. It's this meaning like\nintellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface it's aligned, underneath it's become corrupted. - If we say free speech and\nacademic freedom, often enough, sooner or later, these tenured\nprofessors will get brave. - Wait, do you think the universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions\nfor educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit\nthat's outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create\ninstitution like that? - How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? - Right. You invent something new? - You open a new restaurant. - Yeah. - Like how often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that's just absolutely horrible, and it's poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you\ngo back and it's fantastic? Charlie Munger actually\nhad the best comment on, this great investor, Charlie Munger, has great comment. He was once asked, he's like,\nyou know, his, you know, General Electric was going\nthrough all these challenges and he was asked to do Q&A. It said, \"How would you fix the culture at General Electric?\" And he said, \"Fix the\nculture at General Electric?\" He said, \"I couldn't even fix\nthe culture at a restaurant.\" (Lex laughing) Like, it's insane. Like obviously you can't do it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nobody in business\nthinks you can do that. Like, it's impossible. Like it's not, now look, having said all that, I\nshould also express this 'cause I have a lot of friends\nwho work at these places and are involved in various\nattempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong, I\nwould love to be wrong. I would love for the\nunderpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how\nto do. I would love to fix it, I'd love to see them come back\nto their spoken principles, I think that'd be great. I'd love to see the professors\nwith tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I\nmean, it would be fantastic. You know, my partner and I have done like a lot of\npublic speaking on this topic, it's been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay,\nlike these challenges have to be confronted directly. By the way, let me also\nsay something positive. You know, especially post-October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart\npeople who are major donors and board members of these\ninstitutions like Marc Rowan, you know, who are really\ncoming in trying to, you know, I think legitimately\ntrying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He's working overtime to try to do this. Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question\nwould just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? - I'm a person that\nbelieves in leadership. If you have the right leadership- - [Marc] Right. - The whole system can be changed. - So here's a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? - You know how I think runs it? - [Marc] Yeah. - Whoever the fuck says they run it, that's what great leadership is. Like a president has that power.\n- But how does- - President of university has the leverage 'cause they can mouth off like Elon can. - Can they fire the professors? - They can fire them through\nbeing vocal publicly, yes. - Can they fire the professors? - What are you talking about legally? - [Marc] Can they fire- - No, they cannot fire the professors. - Then we know who runs the university. - The professors? - Yeah, professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they're, of course, in a radicalization\nfeedback cycle driving- - You said feral students?\n- The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows\nis that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them\nbecause they cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same\nthing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They cannot outlast you. I mean it's the whole thing\nthat, it's the resistance. Like they can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. - That's definitely a crisis\nthat needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that\nI'm defending academia here. I agree with you that\nthe situation is dire but I just think that\ninstitutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been\ngrilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation\nyou said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's- - I didn't say Dairy Queen\nis a great restaurant. - Let the listener take- - I said Dairy Queen\nis the best restaurant. - The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc\nAndreessen is saying today- - I don't wanna-\n- Put that into cont- - You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard.\n- Yeah. - They can get like\n4,000 calories in a cup. - They can and they're delicious. - [Marc] It's amazing. - They're truly delicious-\n- They're really fantastic. And they'll put anything in there you want.\n- All right- - Okay, so, but anyway, lemme just close by saying, look, my friends at the university\nsystem, I would just say, \"Look like, this is the challenge.\" Like I would just pose\nthis as the challenge. Like to me, like this is, having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation\nthat actually has to happen. This is the bar that\nactually has to be hit. These problems need to\nbe confronted directly, 'cause I think there's been way too much, I mean, I'm actually worried\nkinda on the other side, there's too much happy talk\nin these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers\ncome to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is\ngoing through, you know, no fault of any of ours,\nbut like the fuse is going and there's some window of time here to fix this and address\nit and justify the money 'cause it just, normal taxpayers sitting in\nnormal towns in normal jobs are not gonna tolerate\nthis for that much longer. - You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep\ninto the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to\nspeak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were\nthere when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of\ncensorship on social media. So take me to, through\nthat history, if you can, the use of censorship. - So I was there on the\nground floor in 1993. (both laughing) - There's multiple floors to\nthis building, apparently. - There are.\n- (laughs) Yeah. - So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. - That is fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. Actually, 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. - Did you have the courage to\nspeak up back then? (laughs) - I did not have any problems\nspeaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, you know, I\nwas legitimate, you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research\nproject actually funded by the federal government\nat a public university. So, you know, I don't\nthink my boss was like in any way outta line,\nbut it was like, yeah, like this web browser thing is great, but like could it just make\nsure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for\na second, as a technologist, I had a issue, which is this\nwas like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm (laughs) that I was going to have to design. And then apparently a variety of other, apparently body parts people are also sensitive about.\n- Yeah. - And then I politely declined to do this. - For just the technical\ndifficulties of it. - Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm a, you know,\nI'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days the internet\ngenerally was, you know, a free-fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting\nas sort of pre-'93, the internet was such a\nspecific niche community. Like, it was like the million\nkind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually like\ndidn't really have a lot of, you know, issues that people\nwere like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn't\nwanna start the process. So I think the way to think\nabout this, so first of all, you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I've been involved with\nthis at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007, so I've seen everything\nin the last, you know, almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I've been involved in most of the other companies over time, so I was an angel investor in Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover\nof Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we\nwere the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk\nspecifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you\nlike the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah, so basically the\nway to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that\ncan have zero censorship. And by the way, that also\nmirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited\nfree speech either. The US First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from\nthe Supreme Court over time. You know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're not\ncovered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are gonna\nstart an internet company and have a service, we can't\nhave that stuff either, right? 'Cause it's illegal or\nit will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always gonna\nhave a censorship engine. I mean, hopefully, it's not\nactually in the browser, but like you're gonna have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now\nyou have a machine right now. Now you have a system where\nyou can put in rules saying, we allow this, we don't allow that. You have enforcement, you\nhave consequences, right? And once that system is in place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now\nanybody in that company or anybody associated with that company, or anybody who wants to\npressure that company will just start to say, \"Okay,\nyou should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\" And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like\nvery, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided\nwith the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. You know, it's the kids that\nwere in school between like, you know, for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and like, they came out\nlike super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started\nmounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that\nthese companies were, you know, very subject to being controlled and the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors\nwere almost all Democrats and, you know, there's\ntremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from\nthe first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people\nand other, you know, law enforcement\nintelligence people came in and worked, and you know, they were all Democrats for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they, you know, picked it up and put it\non, and then they just ran. And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech\nconversation started exactly like you'd expect, which is,\nwe can't have the N-word. And which the answer is fair enough, let's not have the N-word. Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right? And Jordan Peterson has\ntalked a lot about this. The definition of hate\nspeech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, right? So we can't have things that make, you know, people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like me that are\ndisagreeable raise their hands and say, \"Well, that idea right there\nmakes me uncomfortable.\" But of course, that doesn't\ncount as hate speech, right? So, you know, the ring\nof power is on one hand and not on the other hand. And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently like\ncompletely anodyne comments that are completely\nlegitimate on television or on the Senate floor all\nof a sudden our hate speech can't be said online. So that, you know, the\nring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the\nstuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little\nbit of that early on, but of course, that really\nkicked in with Trump. So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by like three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence\nof the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you\nknow, a ring of power that was even more powerful, right? Because, you know, hate\nspeech, it's like, okay, at some point, if\nsomething offensive or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with\nmisinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, what do we know for 800 years or whatever Western civilization, it's that, you know,\nthere's only a few entities that can determine the\ntruth on every topic. You know, there's God, you\nknow, there's the king. We don't have those anymore and the rest of us are\nall imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any\ngroup of experts is gonna sit around the table and decide\non the truth is, you know, deeply anti-Western and\ndeeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation\nkind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax\ninto just full-blown, we're gonna use that weapon\nfor whatever we want. And then of course, then the\nculminating moment on that, that really was the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was we're gonna censor all theories that the COVID virus might\nhave been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies\nlike that was the point where people for the first\ntime, this is like what, three years ago for the\nfirst time they were like, and that was when it sunk in\nwhere it's just like, okay, this has spun completely outta control. But anyway, that's how\nwe got to where we are. And then basically that spell lasted that complex existed and\ngot expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and so when I am super\nproud of those guys, 'cause they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were gonna be\na free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And, you know, they\ntried to just beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by\nthe way, from, you know, let's say certain of the\nplatform companies, you know, basically threatening them.\nAnd they stood up to it. And, you know, sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum\nof speech and conversation, you know, anywhere on planet Earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way, it's great. And then obviously Elon, you\nknow, with X was the, you know, the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. - And there's also like singular moments, I think you've spoken about\nthis, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. - [Marc] Yes. - There's certain moments that just kinda shake\neverybody up, the right person, the right time, just it's a wake-up call. - So that there, and\nI will tell you, like, and I should say Jon Stewart\nattacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him, but I would say, I would say\nlong run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of \"The Daily Show\" when he was on it, you know, for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance\non the Colbert Show. And I don't know how\nbroadly this is, you know, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don't know how,\nif people remember this, but I will tell you in the\nrooms where people discuss what his misinformation and these policies, that\nwas a very big moment. That was probably actually\nthe key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I\nwould say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who\ndon't recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, like, you know, you absolutely\nmust lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep\nall the schools closed. You absolutely must have\neverybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a\nmask like the whole thing. And then one of those was,\nyou absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you're a fascist\nNazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person, right? And that was like uniform\nand that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don't know if\nthey planned it or not, 'cause Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much of it was a bit, but he went on there and\nhe just had one of these, like the Emperor's wearing no\nclosed things where he said, \"It's just not plausible that you had the COVID\nsuper virus appear 300 yards down the street from the\nWuhan Institute (laughs) of lethal coronaviruses.\" Like, it's just not plausible that certainly that you\ncould just rule that out. And then there was another\nkey moment, actually, the more serious version\nwas I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big\npiece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is like\none of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been like\nalt, you know, renegade, there had been, you know, people\nrunning around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was\nlike in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember let's say a board meeting at one of these companies after that, where basically, you know, everybody looked around\nthe table and was like, \"All right, like, I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore.\" And, you know, and then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \"Well, wait a minute, why were we censoring\nthat in the first place?\" And okay, like, and then, you know, the\ndownstream, not that day, but the downstream\nconversations were like, \"Okay, if we made such\na giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective\nmistake censoring that, then what does that say about\nthe rest of our regime?\" And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. - I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made\nwas a courageous act. - [Marc] Yeah, I agree. - I think we need to have\nmore of that in the world. And like you said, Elon,\neverything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg\ndid on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? - He has become, I think, an outstanding\ncommunicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for\na lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he's, you know,\nhe's one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And you know, as you do\nwith all of your episodes, like when somebody sit\nand talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody 'cause it's really hard to\nbe artificial for that long. And, you know, he's now\ndone that repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then, look, again, I would maybe put him in\nthe third category now with, certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put\nhim up there now with, you know, kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that. Like he said on that show\nwhat he really believes, he said all the same things\nthat he says in private. Like, I don't think there's\nreally any discrepancy anymore. I would say he has\nalways taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running\na company the size of Meta and to running services\nthat are that large. And I think, you know, his\nconception of what he's doing, which I think is correct,\nis he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. And then, you know, the\ncompany has, you know, many tens of thousands of\nemployees and many investors, and it's a public company,\nand he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so, you know, he has\nnot felt like he has had, let's just say, the complete\nflexibility that Elon has had. And, you know, people could\nargue that one way or the other, but, you know, he talked about a lot. He's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm gonna put\nmyself right back up there. Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this.\nLike, I've also learned a lot. Like, my views on things\nare very different than they were 10 years\nago on lots of topics. And so, you know, I've\nbeen on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as, or better\nthan anybody else I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show\nabout something very important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a set of decisions\nthat you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and\nso forth and it's valid, but you are under tremendous\nexternal pressure as well. And by the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've got your executives\nin some cases coming at you. You've got your board in\nsome cases coming at you. You've got your\nshareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire\nnonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you and, you know, that's\nthe really, you know, stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation\nof the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, then again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they\nclearly didn't wanna do and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I say, like I've known every CEO of Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the\njob, it was just daily beatings. Like it just getting punched in the face every single day, constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting (laughs) physically\npunched in the face, and then-\n- Getting better and better. Yeah. - You know, and he's very good\nat, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people\nto have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate\nwith like, I would say, extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in\nhis job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a\nlot about him that he has, you know, risen to this\noccasion the way that he has. And by the way, I should\nalso say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, you know, legitimate\nthing for people to say, but you know, it's like, \"Oh, you're only doing\nthis because of Trump, or, you know, whatever.\" And it's just like, no, like\nhe has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them\nout for a very long time. And so I think what\nyou saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the moment thing that could change at any time. - So what do you think it's like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal\npressure and external pressure? What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? - That's a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like, it's not a thing, right? And again, legitimately so, like CEOs get paid a lot,\nlike the whole thing. There's a lot of great things about it. So it's not like they\nshould be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that\nthey are human beings. And it is the case that\nit is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job is because your words\ncarry tremendous weight and you are dealing with\nextremely complicated issues, and you're under a tremendous\namount of emotional, you know, personal, emotional stress. And, you know, you often end\nup not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like, keep up an exercise routine\nand all those things. And you know, you come under family stress 'cause you're working all the time. Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO of our last company before\nwe started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life\nwas even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was like supposed\nto be like having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you get that a lot. But the key thing is like, you\ncan't talk to people, right? So I mean, you could talk to\nyour spouse and your kids, but like, they don't understand that they're networking in your company. They don't understand, have\nthe context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And they can't resist. Like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily\nrely on what they say. It's very hard in most\ncompanies to talk to your board because they can fire you. Now, Mark has the situation\n'cause he has control, it actually turns out he\ncan talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about\nmany things that he does that most CEOs won't talk\nto their boards about because we literally,\nbecause we can't fire him. But a general, including\nall the CEOs of Twitter, that none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the board members, they're gonna fire you, you\ncan't talk to the shareholders 'cause they'll just like\ndump your stock, right? Like, okay, so every once in a while, what you find is basically the\nbest-case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a\nlittle bit outta that. But even that's fraught with peril 'cause can you really talk\nabout confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it's just a very\nlonely isolating thing to start with. And then on top of that,\nyou apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal, external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand\nmost forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. - Hmm.\n- Right. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external\npressure you can withstand, and by that I mean\ninvestors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative article,\nyou know, negative headline and you know, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many\nof those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot withstand\nis the internal crack. And what I always look for in high-pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the\ninternal team cracks. Because I know the minute that happens, we're in a different regime. (laughs) Like, it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid. Like we're in a different regime and like the whole thing\ncan unravel in the next week 'cause then people turn, I mean this, I guess this is what's happening\nin Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire\nchief turned on each other, and that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get\nput back together again. It is over, it is not\ngoing to work ever again. And that's what happens\nto inside companies. And so somebody like Mark is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's been very good at\nmaintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,\na lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing\nI'd say, as I said, that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And especially, although not\nall one is government pressure. Is that when your\ngovernment comes for you? Like yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out\nof them in short order. - Can you just linger on that 'cause it is maybe educating\nand deeply disturbing? You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again\nthis government pressure. So you think they've crossed a line into essentially criminal\nlevels of pressure? - Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs) but yes, absolute criminality. - Can you explain how\nthose possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? - So I just start with\nis a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good 'cause it needs\nto be in the public record. And so there's three forms of things that are in the public record\nthat people can look at. So when is the Twitter Files,\nright, which Elon put out with the set of journalists\nwhen he took over. And I will just tell\nyou, the Twitter Files are 100% representative of what I've seen at every\nother one of these companies. And so you can just see\nwhat happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies,\nyou know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind\nof pressure that they got. So that's number one. That's stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven't. The second is Mark referenced\nthis in the Rogan podcast. There's a congressman Jim Jordan, who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, you\nknow, whatever three years have done a full-scale\ninvestigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have\nnow been made public and you can download those reports. And there's like 2,000 pages\nworth of material on that. And that's essentially\nthe Facebook version of the Twitter Files just arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself\ntalking about this on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just\ndefer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is\nbasically the government, you know, over time and then\nculminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years, just decided that the First\nAmendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that\nfederal laws around free speech and around conspiracies\nto take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure. They just like literally\narbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, you know, threaten repercussions and force them to censor. And you know, there's\nthis whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment\nonly applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't\napply to companies. It's like, well, there's actually a little\nbit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely\napplies to the government. Like 100%, the First Amendment\napplies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship\nregime that was put in place. There was no due process\nput in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just\nlike flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. And then there are\nspecific federal statutes, it's 18 241 and 18 242. And one of them applies to federal employees,\ngovernment employees, and the other one\napplies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United\nStates Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional\nrights are enumerated, for example, in the First\nAmendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes\naway rights that you have, they don't need to be\nspecifically enumerated rights in the Constitution order\nto still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have\nthe rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right, and so de-banking\nqualifies as a right, you know, right to access to the financial system,\nis every bit something that's subject to these\nlaws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, which is we've talked\nabout two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we've talked about the companies. The government employees\nfor sure have misbehaved. The companies, there's a very\ninteresting question there as to whether they are victims\nor perpetrators or both. You know, they will defend\nand they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims,\nnot perpetrators, right? They're the downstream\nsubjects of pressure, you know, not the cause of pressure, but there's a big swath of\npeople who are in the middle and specifically the ones that\nare funded by the government that I think are in\npossibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of these\nthird-party censorship bureaus. I mean the one that is\nsort of is most obvious is the so-called Stanford\nInternet Observatory that got booted up there\nover the last several years. And they basically were funded\nby the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in\nthis very interesting spot where there could be, you know, very obvious theory under\nwhich they're basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they're\nalso very exposed on this and have behaved in just\nflagrantly illegal ways. - So fundamentally, government should not\ndo any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? - Can't. Not allowed. - It really is disturbing. I mean it probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the the old will to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection 'cause you can't put a check\non power for government, right? - There are so many ways\nthat they can get you, like there are so many ways\nthey can come at you and get you and, you know, the thing\nhere to think about is a lot of times when people\nthink about government action, they think about legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It's like this, you know, fancy little bill sneaked\nalong and goes this- - I'm just the bill. Yeah.\n- Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. Like that doesn't actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly\nwhat we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about\ngovernment power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the\nequivalent of legislation, but having not gone through\nthe legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that\nthe DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They're regulated and there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche\nyou'll hear a lot, which is, \"Oh, private companies can\ndo whatever they want.\" It's like, \"Oh, no, they can't.\" They're subject to tens of\nthousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes\ndown when you don't comply with regulations is profound. Like they can completely\nwreck your company with no ability for you\nto do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole\nprogram a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency\nfor payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were gonna\nbuild into every product, and they were gonna be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government\nand they went to the, all these different try to\nfigure out how to make it, so it's like fully compliant\nwith anti-money laundering and all these, you know,\ncontrols and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters\nto the big banks saying, \"We're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every\naspect of your business is going to come under\ngreatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\" which is, of course, the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner\nrestaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov\ncocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? And like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a law, it's\nnot even a regulation, it's just like straight\ndirect state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they're just like flat\nout telling you what to do, which is, of course,\nwhat a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. And so anyway, so what\nthese companies experienced was they experienced the\nfull panoply of this, but the level of intensity\nwas in that order, it was actually, legislation\nwas the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important and then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were\nultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people\nwho don't do it, right? So like as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, you have to decide. You don't wanna live in\nthat regime. I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people\non the right got very angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. You know, maybe some people on the left will now not want their, you know, Democratic nominees to\nbe so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written\nin the FT just now saying, we just need like broad\nafter what we've been through in the last decade, we need to broad base\ntruth and reconciliation, you know, efforts to really\nget to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like ultimately, we need\npeople to go to jail 'cause we need to set\nobject lessons that say that you don't get to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to\nthe new administration, and I don't wanna speak for them and I don't wanna predict\nwhat they're gonna do, but they for sure have\nthe ability to do both of those things and you know,\nwe'll see where they take it. - Yeah, it's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants\nthis kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people\nthat are participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's\nthat kind of protection. Nobody wants that. - So I use the metaphor, the ring of power.\n- Yeah. - And for people who\ndon't catch the reference, that's \"Lord of the Rings.\" And the thing with the Ring of Power and \"Lord of the Rings,\"\nit's the ring the Gollum has in the beginning and\nit turns you invisible. And it turns out it like unlocks all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically, the moral\nlesson of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which was, you know, written by a guy who thought very deeply\nabout these things is, yeah, the ring of power is\ninherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they're like, \"Gandalf, just put on the\nring and like fix this.\" Right, and he will not put the ring on even to like end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. And then, you know, as it starts, the character of Gollum is\nthe result of, you know, like a normal character\nwho ultimately becomes, you know, this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. And so, I mean, I think you said something\nactually quite profound there, which is the ring of power\nis infinitely tempting. You know, the censorship\nmachine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, like\nyou are going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting\n'cause it's so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people\nfeel any of this today. They should. I don't know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years\nlater, you know, you would hope that you would realize that\nyour soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being, you know, extremely authoritarian\nand anti-democratic and anti-Western. - Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the\nmost powerful human on Earth. - I'm not sure about that. - You don't think he is? - Well, he doesn't have the nukes so. - Nukes. (Marc laughing) Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? - Yeah. - How can he and/or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting\naspects of this power? - I mean, I think the\ndanger is there with power. It's flat out there. I would say with Elon, we'll see. I would say with Elon, and\nI would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would\nsay so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost\nevery front for like, you know, the last 30 years. (Lex laughing) But including all this stuff recently, like I think he's been a\nreal hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say,\nI guess the sort of case that he has this level of\npower is that some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are, you know, are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is, I do think a lot of how\nElon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's the companies\nhe's running directly where I think he's doing very well, and we're investors in multiple\nof them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements, and then it's the downstream\neffects of his statements. So like for example, it's, you know, for the last couple weeks,\nit's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this\nrape gang scandal, you know, this rape organized child\nrape thing in the UK. And you know, it's a preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren't willing to talk about it, it kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden\nthere's now in the UK this like massive explosion\nof basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's\nkind of woken up and being like, \"Oh, my God,\nyou know, this is really bad.\" And there will be now, you know, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know,\nhe played the role of the boy who said, the emperor\nhas no clothes, right? But here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about\nsomething that was true, right? And so had he said it about\nsomething that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody\nover there instantly, they were like, \"Oh, yeah,\nhe's right,\" right? (laughs) Like nobody seriously\nsaid they're just arguing the details now. So number one, it's like,\nokay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far... Put it this way. Like, how worried are we about\nsomebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say,\nespecially in the last decade of what we've been through where everybody's been lying\nall the time about everything, I'd say, I think we\nshould run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the\nmoney and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like it,\nthere's a clear-cut case that the more money in\npolitics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic\nof public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary\noutspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost. You'll notice that money and\npolitics has all most vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Trump spent far, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don't know, something like 3 billion total in Trump, I think spent again like a\nthird or a fourth of that. And so the money in politics kind of topic has kind of vanished from\na popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit\nnow that Elon is spending. You know, but again, it's like, okay, he's spending,\nbut the data would seem to indicate in the last, at\nleast in the last eight years, that money doesn't win\nthe political battles. It's actually like the\nvoters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there I\nwould say like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and use in a definitive way. - And I don't know if\nthose parallels there, but I could also say\njust on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that's not always the case. So that's a good thing there.\n- Yeah. - If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. (laughs) Who gets to put on the ring? - [Marc] Frodo. - Frodo, yeah.\n- Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of\n\"Lord of the Rings\" right, is even Frodo would've been, you know, even Frodo would've been corrupted, right? But, you know, nevertheless,\nyou had somebody who could do what it took at at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because it's sort of our\npost-Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort of this post-secularized\nChristian context in the West now, and it's, you know, we\nconsider Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe\nessentially all the same things. We just dress them up\nin sort of fake science. (Lex laughing) So the one thing that we're all told, we're all taught from early is that the best people in\nthe world are the people who care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know,\nall of our figures are people who care about all of, you know... Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared\nabout all of humanity. Like it's this universe, the person who cares the\nmost about everybody. And with Elon, you have a\nguy who literally, like, is, he talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly\nthe same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us through\nmulti-planetary civilization, so that we can survive a\nstrike on any one planet, so that we can extend the\nlight of human consciousness into the world and, you\nknow, into the universe and have it persist, you know, in the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. (both laughing) - Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. - Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear. - You said that we\nalways end up being ruled by the elite of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? - So this comes from a\nItalian political philosopher from about 100 years ago named Robert... I'm gonna mangle it from, let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. And then I learned about\nit through a famous book on politics, probably the\nbest book on politics written in the 20th century called \"The Machiavellians\"\nby this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in \"The Machiavellians,\" he resurrects what he calls is this sort of Italian realist school of political philosophy from the '10s and '20s. And\nthese were people, to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who\nwere trying to understand the actual mechanics of how\npolitics actually works. So to get to the actual sort\nof mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, Michels\nhad this concept ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law of oligarchy, and I mean take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy 'cause it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there's basically three\nforms of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of many. There's oligarchy, which\nis rule of the few. And there's monarchy,\nwhich is rule of the one. And you can just use that\nas a general framework of any government you're gonna be under is gonna be one of those,\njust mechanical observation without even saying\nwhich one's good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that\nMichels asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like is there actually\nsuch a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually\nlike direct government? And what he did was he mounted this sort of\nincredible historical exploration of whether democracies had\never existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most\ndemocratic private organization in the world that he\ncould find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist\nGerman autoworkers union that was like wholly\ndevoted to the workers of the world uniting, you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization\nout of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and\nhe is like, \"Oh, nope.\" There's a leadership class. You know, there's like six guys at the top and they control everything (laughs) and then they lead the rest\nof the membership along, you know, by the nose, which is, of course, the\nstory of every union. The story of every union is\nalways the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers' union, right? Like, you know, there's\na guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number\ntwo is his son, right? Like, that's not like a, you\nknow, an accident, right? So the iron law oligarchy\nbasically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling\nelite structurally. And he said, \"The reason for that is because the masses\ncan't organize,\" right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is\n25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize,\nthe majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in\npolitics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a\nsmall organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence... I forget the name of it. It was called like The Workers' Revolt or something like that. There was like a two-year period where they basically experimented\nwith direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition\nsystem, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. You know, anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes\nit's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe, and it's caused enormous\ndamage to the state. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And so of course, they didn't\ngive us a direct democracy, they gave us a representative\ndemocracy, right? And so they built the\noligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch\nand the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson\nof \"The Machiavellians\" is you can deny that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think\nabout how to make a system work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that\nis actually what's happening. - And lucky for us, the founders saw this\nand figured out a way to, given that there's going\nto be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite-\n- Yes. - So it doesn't get out of hand. - And it was very clever. Right? And you know, some of this was\nbased on earlier experiments. By the way, you know, these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of like Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance\nhistory, you know, \"The Federalist Papers,\" they\nargue this a great length. You can read it all. You know, they ran like a\none of the best seminars in world history trying\nto figure this out. And they went through all this and yeah. And so they thought\nthrough it very carefully, but just, I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did it just through the three\nbranches of government, right? Executive, legislative and judicial, sort of balance of powers. But the other way, they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done earlier. I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, right? And so the, you know,\nthe House and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population,\nand the Senate is not, right? The small states have\njust as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get\nreelected every two years to make it very responsive\nto the will of the people. And they made the decision\nto have the Senate get reelected every six years\nso that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose\none or the other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does\nit live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And you know, there's lots of open\nquestions there, but you know, this system has survived\nfor coming on 250 years with a country that has been\nspectacularly successful. But I don't think, at least,\nyou know, I don't think any of us would trade the\nsystem for any other one. And so it's, yeah, one of the\ngreat all-time achievements. - Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were\nall pretty young relative to our current set of leaders.\n- They were. Many in their 20s at the\ntime, and like super geniuses. This is one of those things\nwhere it's just like, all right, something happened where there\nwas a group of people where, you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einsteins of politics. Yeah. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical\npractice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused\non what would actually work, which is, you know, I\nthink the way to think about these things. - There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. - They were shape rotators,\nnot word cells. (laughs) - I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were center to them, you're center to a lot of memes. - [Marc] I was. - You're the meme dealer\nand the meme popularizer. - That's true. That meme I get some credit for and then the current thing is, the other one I get some credit for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. - Take credit and run with it. - [Marc] Yep. - If we can just linger\non the Machiavellians. It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned looking\nat the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've\nseen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting\nthings you can sort of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? - Yeah, so a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this\na bit with the universities, which is you can apply a\nMachiavellian-style lens to the... It's why I posed the\nquestion to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the\nuniversity, the trustees, the administration, the\nstudents or the faculty? And you know, the true\nanswer is some combination of the three or of the\nfour, plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera, right? And so you know, there's a mechanical\ninterpretation of that. I mean, companies operate\nunder the exact same, you know, set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like the CEO runs the\ncompany basically up to the day that either the shareholders\nor the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt,\nit's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it's very hard for the\nCEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if The New\nYork Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand\nis who can get who fired? You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper\ncolumnist who makes, you know, $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes, you\nknow, $200 million a year. And it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before\nI have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. - Did anyone ever get fired\nfrom the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? (laughs) So Bill like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. - No, 'cause what happens\nis they wear it with a... And yeah, I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, right? Which is, you know, if\nthey're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably\npriding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to legitimate criticism and, you know, they're\nobviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight\nto the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. You know, and I happen to know the CEO, and I think he's quite a good CEO, but I like, well, this is a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer\nrun his own company, right? Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating\nplaying out right now. Not to dwell on these fires, but you see the pressure\nreveals things, right? And so if you've been\nwatching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, like whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical\nsocial revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It's endorses every crazy\nleft-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of\nall the people who, you know, are currently burning\nthe city to the ground. It's just like endorsed\nevery single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, for the first time, I think put his foot down right\nbefore the November election and said, we're getting... He said, \"We're gonna get outta this thing where we just always\nendorse the Democrat.\" And we said, we're not\nendorsing, I think he said, \"We're not endorsing for the presidency.\" And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like our billionaire backer who's... And I don't know what he spends, but like, he must be burning 50 or 100\nmillion dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. He paid 500 million for\nit, which is amazing. Back when people still thought\nthese things were businesses. And then he's probably\nburned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another\n50, 100 million a year to do this. And the journalists at\nthe LA Times hate him with the fury of 1,000 suns. Like they just like absolutely\nfreaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones that\ncan get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, you know,\nmost horrible things about him. And they wanna constantly run\nthese stories attacking him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in\nLA are having right now to this fire, and to this just like\nincredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head\nendorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour,\nhe's basically just, he's decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his\nown newspaper. (laughs) Very smart guy. He is not a press tour and\nhe is basically saying, yeah, yes, we did all that and we\nendorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and\nwe're gonna completely change. And his paper is, you know,\nin a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn't been him. (laughs) It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, the\nowner is showing up saying, \"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge.\" And the reporters are\nsaying, \"No, you're not.\" And like it is freaking on. And so again, if the, the\nMachiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power\nactually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and super powerful who even\nowns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full-scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist? - And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there. - And firing people.\n- Firing people. Yeah. - You know, he has removed\npeople and he has set new rules. I mean, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying he's now at long last actually\nexercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other\nowners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know, so\nhe's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really\ninteresting open question. Like, you know, in a fight\nbetween the employees and the employer, like\nit's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. - And just to stay on\njournalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just wanna say put him in\nthe category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever\nseen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. - What do you think is like\nthe most impressive example? - Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to, like, I mean, it's like kicking\nthe beehive or whatever, you know, what's gonna follow and do that. I mean that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia\nand then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer\njust tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. And just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people\nlike that out in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be\ncourageous themselves. - Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? - I knew of Neri, his wife, who's a brilliant\nresearcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she's amazing. - Well, the reason I ask\nif you knew about Bill is because a lot of people\nhad not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before some of the\ncampaigns he's been running since in public, and with\nHarvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he was so-called activist\ninvestor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected\nfor probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out, they weren't for the most part battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national\nstories, but in the business and investing world, the\nactivist investor is a very, it's like in the movie \"Taken.\" It's a very specific set of skills. (both laughing) - Yeah. - On how to like really take control of situations.\n- Yeah. - And how to wreck the people\nwho you're going up against. And there's been\ncontroversy over the years on this topic, and there's\ntoo much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid is,\nyou know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly\nmanaged or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that\nmeans the existing management is become entrenched and\nlazy, mediocre, you know, whatever. Not, you're responding to the\nneeds of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically\ngo in with a minority position and then they rally support\namong other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show\nup and they force change. But they are the\naggressive version of this. And I've been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these-\n- Oh-oh. - Where it is amazing\nhow much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don't have formal control. So it would be another chess\npiece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens\nis the effective analysts, a large amount of time, they end up taking over\ncontrol of companies even though they never own more than like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it\nturns out with Bill's, it's such a fascinating case. 'Cause he has that like complete skillset. - (laughs) Yeah. - And he has now decided\nto bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of\nthese places, you know, and some of these battles\nare still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of\npeople who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now\nwith infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that\nkind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook, like in real time. And so Liam Neeson skillset is\ngetting more broadly diffused just by being able to\nwatch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody\nwho's really affecting how all this is playing out. - But even skillset\naside just courage and- - Yes, including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, 'cause like he hasn't been, I'll give you an example. Like my firm venture\ncapital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I\nfeel like I can't do or say 'cause I feel like I would\nbe bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where\nhe worries about that. And so a couple things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship\nwith his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors...\nI know this for a fact. His investors have been\nremarkably supportive of him doing that. 'Cause as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. And so it is the same thing he does in the his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip\nof the spear on something that actually a lot\nmore people agree with. - Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. - And just again, our, you know, how I started is a lot of\npeople are just fed up. - You've been spending a\nbunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new\nadministration in many ways, including interviewing\npeople who might join. So what's your general\nsense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new administration? - So I should start by saying I'm not a member of\nthe new administration. I'm not like in the room\nwhen a lot of these people are being selected. - I believe you said unpaid intern. - I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and I,\nyou know, when helpful, but I'm not making the decisions,\nnor am I in a position to, you know, speak for the administration. So I don't wanna say anything that would cause people\nto think I'm doing that. It's a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is outta office, and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll recall,\nthere was a fair amount of controversy over the\nend of the first term. - Oh, yeah. - The specific concern was, you know, the first Trump administration, you know, they will all say this is like, they didn't come in with a team, right? So you know, they didn't\ncome in with a team and most of the sort of institutional base of the Republican Party\nwere Bush Republicans. And many of them had\nbecome never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time\nputting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time\ngetting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them 2 to 3\nyears to kind of even get the government in place. And then they basically only\nhad the government in place, you know, for basically like\n18 months, and then COVID hit. You know, and then sort of\nthe aftermath and everything, and all the drama and\nheadlines and everything. And so the concern, you know, including from some various smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he gonna be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? 'Cause maybe people got burned out. Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing\nto go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people\nin the first term came under, like, you know, with their\nown withering legal assaults, and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a\nlot of stuff happened, lots of investigations,\nlots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots\nof debanking, by the way. A lot of the officials in the\nfirst Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. - Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. - In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and\nchildren with our ring of power. And so there's like\nthis legitimate question as to like, whether, okay, what will the team for\nthe second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing\nwith the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks\nbetter than the first term and not 'cause the\npeople in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like, influx of like incredibly\ncapable people that have shown up that wanna be part of this, and you just didn't have\nthat the first time. And so they're just\ndrawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than\nthey had the first time. And they're drawing on people\nwho know what the game is. Like they're drawing\non people now who know what is gonna happen and\nthey're still willing to do it. And so they're gonna\nget, I think, you know, some of the best people\nfrom the first term, but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get\nthe first time around. And then second is\nthere's a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they're just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned\nhow everything works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view and now they're 10 years older and they're ready to\ngo serving government. And so there's a\ngenerational shift happening. And actually one of the\ninteresting things about the team that's forming up is\nit's remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members,\nand then many of the second and third level people are\nlike in their 30s and 40s, you know, which is a big change\nfrom the gerontocracy that, you know, we've been under\nfor the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has\nbeen outstanding, you know, and we could sit here and\nlist tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people\nwho are running, you know, it's everything from the people who are running all the\ndifferent departments at HHS. It's the people running, you know, the number two at the\nPentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got, actually two of\nmy partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah, like many, many\nparts of the government, the people are like, really impressive. - Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the\nhuman being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's kind of circles\nof sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically\nsuck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good\nposition to speak to the degree that's happening versus\nhiring based on merit and just getting great teams. - Yeah, so look, I just\nstart by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are, you know, very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. Like he definitely seems\nvery aware of that. So that's one thing. I would just say that the, I\nthink the way to look at that, I mean, and look, like I said, I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say that it's again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished\npeople in the business world and in the medical field. I just, you know, Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH, so I was actually, I was\npart of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. - Nice. Jay's amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. - So I literally got, this is a story. I got to the transition\noffice for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the\ninterview interviewing teams, and they gave us, I didn't\nknow who the candidates were, and they gave us the\nsheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I\nsaw Jay's name, and I, like, I almost physically fell outta my chair. - Yeah. - And I was just like... (laughs) You know, and\nI happen to know Jay, I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like, talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure- - Yeah.\n- Over the last five years. - And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and\nthoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly- - Very serious, very\nanalytical, very applied. And yes, 100%. Tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look\nback at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you\nknow, none of us are perfect, but like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And, you know, we would all\nbe much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just like an\nincredibly capable guy. And look, and then he\nlearned from all that, right? He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody\nlike that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly. It's just a gigantic upgrade. You know, and then Marty\nMakary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a\nCDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been\nspending time with Dr. Oz, so, you know, and I'm not, like, again, I'm not on these teams. I'm not in the room. But like, I've been\nspending enough time trying to help that, like his level of insight into the healthcare system,\nit's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy\nwho's been like in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this\nstuff and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for,\nyou know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, he's like a walking\nencyclopedia on these things. And you know, very dynamic, you know, very charismatic, very\nsmart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have\nsomebody like that in there. And so anyway, they're\njust, I have like 30 of these stories now across\nall these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast\nto the last four years. And it, not even, these people\nare not in the same ballpark. They're just like wildly better. And so it, you know, the pound for pound is\nmaybe be the best team in the White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team\nlike this or something. But there's a lot of really\ngood people in there now. - Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to DOGE? What's the most wildly successful\nnext two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also, can you think\nabout the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges\nwould it be facing? - Yeah, so start by\nsaying, again, I'm not... Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer, I'm not on DOGE, (laughs)\nI'm not a member of DOGE. - We should say there's\nabout 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring. No, I'm just kidding. - Both the angels and\nthe devils on my shoulder are-\n- Okay. All right, cool. - So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE. I'm not in charge of DOGE.\n- Yeah. - Those guys are doing\nit, I'm not doing it. But you know, again,\nI'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, I mean, the basic outlines\nare in public, right? Which it's a time limited, you\nknow, basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the\nexecutive branch, right? And so the implementation\nwill happen through the White House. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is the three kind of streams,\nyou know, kind of target sets, and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. And so, you know, the headline\nnumber, they, you know, put us the $2 trillion number and there's already, you know, disputes over that and whatever, and there's whole question there. But then there's the people thing. And the people thing is\ninteresting 'cause you get into these very kind of\nfascinating questions. And I've been doing this,\nI won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this\nfor people in government as a pop quiz, and I can stump\nthem every time, which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere\nbetween 450 and 520. And nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for\nthe federal government? And the answer is, you know,\nsomething on the order, I forget, but like 4\nmillion full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large\npeople component to this. And then by the way, there's\na related component to that, which is how many of them\nare actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings\nare still empty, right? And then there's questions\nof like, are people, you know, working from home? Or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension, and of course, the money and\nthe people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing, right? And I described earlier\nhow basically our system of government is much more\nnow based on regulations than legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that\nwent through Congress. They're from an agency that,\nthat created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is, Elon have already described, we wanna do the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the\ngovernment off people's backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. But there's also something\nelse that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set\nof Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that\nwent directly after the idea that the executive branch can\ncreate regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding\ncongressional legislation. And most of the federal\ngovernment that exists today, including most of the departments\nand most of the rules, and most of the money,\nand most of the people, most of it is not enforcing\nlaws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \"Large parts, you know, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress,\nthe way that the cartoon said that it should, that may\nnot actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to, they\ndid nothing based on this. They didn't, you know,\npull anything back in. But the new regime, if they\nchoose to, could say, \"Look, the thing that we're doing here is not, you know, challenging the laws, we're actually complying with\nthe Supreme Court decision that basically says we have\nto unwind a lot of this, and we have to unwind the regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional, we have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people.\" And that's how you get from, basically you connect the\nthread from the regulation part back to the money part,\nback to the people part. They have work going on\nall three of these threads. They have, I would say,\nincredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super\ncynical on this topic. And they're like, \"This is impossible. This could never possibly work.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I can't tell you what the secret plans are,\nbut like blow my mind.\" And all three of those,\nlike, they have ideas that are like really quite\namazing as you'd expect from, you know, from the people involved. And so over the course of the\nnext few months, you know, that'll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is, this is going to be very\ndifferent than attempts, like there have been other\nprograms like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one, and then there were others\nbefore that, Reagan had one. The difference is this\ntime, their social media. And so there has never been like, it's interesting, one of the\nreasons people in Washington are so cynical is because\nthey know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad\nspending and all the bad rules and all the, like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion\ndollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that's compounding, and\nit's now passing the size of the defense department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon it's gonna\nbe adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be\nadding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point we enter a\nhyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or\nBrazil and (indistinct), right? And so, like everybody in\nDC knows that something has to be done, and then\neverybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible\nto do anything, right? They know all the problems and they also know the sheer\nimpossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're\nnot taking into account, that what the critics are not taking into account\nis these guys can do this in the full light of day and\nthey can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism, they can expose any element\nof, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government spending. They can run victory\nlapse every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the\npeople into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our\nMachiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy,\noligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of\nthe few, rule of the one. You could think about what's\nhappening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president, rule\nof the one with some power. And then we have the\npeople who can't organize, but they can be informed\nand they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich\nhappening right now, is a way to think about it, which is you've got basically (indistinct) if you got rule of one combining with the rule of many, right? And rule of many is they\ndo get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically. And then essentially\nCongress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic\nclass in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, I think have the power to\ndo all kinds of things here, and I think that would be\nthe way I would wash it. - The transparency. I mean, Elon, just by\nwho he is incentivized to be transparent and show\nthe bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's gonna be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just\nmakes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. - These people are spending our money. - [Lex] Yeah. - These people have enormous\ncontempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here's the thing\nyou hear in Washington, here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear\nis, \"This is impossible, they'll be able to do nothing.\" And then, yeah, I walk them\nthrough this and they're like, it starts to dawn on them that\nthis is a new kind of thing. And then they're like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in\nentitlements and the debt and the military.\" And so like, yeah, you've\ngot like this silly, fake whatever, you know,\nNPR funding or whatever, and like, it's a rounding\nerror and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever,\n$500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging\nstations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they bill eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And costs you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn't matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer\nis like, \"What the fuck?\" (Lex laughing) - What do you mean?\n- It's $30 billion. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then the experts are like, and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's surrounding error.\" No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this\ncavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you're\nabout the 3 trillion. - Yeah.\n- Okay. Then there's the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the\nfederal budget and percentage? No, it's not. But $30 billion divided\nby 30, do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like, what's that math expert? - $100. - $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic\nrelationship with your wife. There's like 100 things\nthat that person can do with $100 that they're not doing 'cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where\nthe money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that $30\nbillion program is not something that is like a very\nimportant thing to go after, is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer-\n- Yeah. - Is just off the charts. And then that's just\none of those programs, there's like 100 of those programs and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of\nthis stuff is running well, like the one thing we know is that none of this\nstuff is running well. Like we know that for sure, right? And we know these people\naren't showing up to work and like we know that all this crazy stuff is happening, right? And like, you know, do you remember Elon's\nstory of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. Okay so Pennsylvania is\nlike a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness, and death, right? And the federal government\nhas just like, let it happen, these incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing\nlaw enforcement thing that they needed to do in\nPennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling\nraw milk with armed raids. - [Lex] Right. - And it turns out it\nreally pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places\n'cause they don't have cars. But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the\nreasons why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law\nenforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, like the system's not working. And so you add up, just\npick $130 billion programs. All right, now you're okay. Math major, 100 times 100. - 10,000. - $10,000. Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. - But it's also not just about money. That's really, obviously money\nis a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude- - [Marc] Yes. - That then in sort of, in\nthe ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody\nwants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that corruption\ncan, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy 'cause you don't wanna be transparent about having done nothing all\nyear, all this kind of stuff. And you now wanna reverse that, so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government,\nbecause the amazing thing if you're to steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can\ndirectly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting. As long as there's no\nbureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. - Yeah. So here's the trick, this blew my mind 'cause I was, you know, once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in\ngovernment called impoundment. And so if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning\nis a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires\nCongress to authorize money to be spent by the\nexecutive branch, right? So the executive branch\ngoes to Congress says, \"We need money X.\" Congress does their thing. They come back and they\nsay, \"You can have money Y.\" The money's appropriated from Congress, the executive branch\nspends it on the military or whatever they spend it\non, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations\nto nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an\nadditional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which\nis the executive branch not only needs Congress to\nappropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is\nnot allowed to underspend. - Yeah, I'm aware of\nthis. I'm aware of this. - And so there's this thing\nthat happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal\nyear, which is September 30th, and it's the great budget flush. And any remaining money\nthat's in the system that they don't know how\nto productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively. - Yep. - To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn't wanna spend the\nmoney can't not spend it. - Yeah. - Like, okay, A, that's not\nwhat's in the constitution. And there's actually quite\na good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that's played\nout in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I\nthink an open mind, you're like, \"All right, this is not\nwhat the founders meant.\" And then number two, again,\nwe go back to this thing of contempt, like, can\nyou imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you're\ndoing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've\nsold your soul, right? Like it's just like, I actually\nthink you sort of had it in a really good point,\nwhich is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. - Yeah.\n- Right. 'Cause it makes them bad people. And they didn't start out\nwanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this like- - Yeah, everywhere.\n- Everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged\nwhat I've seen so far. - It seems like a lot of people\nwill try to slow 'em down, but yeah-\n- For sure. - I hope they get far.\n- Yeah. - Another difficult topic, immigration. - [Marc] Yeah. - What's your take on the, let's say, heated H-1B visa debate\nthat's going on online and legal immigration in general? - Yeah, I should so start by saying, I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I'm not planning to be,\nthis is not an issue that I'm working on or\nthat I'm going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing.\nSo my firm is doing, so like, I'm not in this in the new\nadministration or the government. I'm not planning to be, so\npurely just personal opinion. So I would say I would\ndescribe as a complex or nuanced, hopefully\nnuanced view on this issue that's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I kind of thought\nabout this, you know, I didn't say anything about\nit all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a\nlot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a\nvery different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because\nof the combination of where I came from and\nthen where I ended up. And so, oh, let's start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration\nargument many, many times the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been\nin DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of\ntrying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more\nhigh-skilled immigration. And, you know, I think that\nargument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, has paid off for the\nUS in many, many ways. And we can go through it,\nbut I think it's the argument everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's, right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. - So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you\ncan get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity\nof the US companies. - Yeah, and then it's not just good for the them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry,\nit's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that\nthen create many more jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would've previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Like everybody wins,\nthere are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely\nglorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be\na moral right argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against\nit is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right, I mean that-\n- Right. - That's the thing. And like I said, I've made\nthat argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd also say, look,\nI would say number one, I believe a lot of it,\nI'll talk about the parts I don't believe, but\nI believe a lot of it. And then the other part is,\nlook, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, like\nmy own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends, you know,\nare just this like amazing, you know, panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And you know, I've worked,\nI dunno at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And hopefully, over time, it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And you know, it's been amazing and they've done many of\nthe most important things in my industry and it's\nbeen really remarkable. So that's all good. And then, you know, there's\njust the practical version of the argument, which\nis we are the main place these people get educated anyway, right? The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, this is the old kind of Mitt\nRomney, staple a green card to every, you know, at least, you know, maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologist\nwe could quibble about, but you know, the roboticist\nfor sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- - At least I won you\nover on something today. - Well, no, I'm\nexaggerating for effect, so- - Oh. (Marc laughing) And I lost you,\nI had you for half a second. - I haven't gotten to the\nother side of the argument yet. - [Lex] Okay, thank you.\n- So surely, we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. - The rollercoaster is going up. - The rollercoaster is\nrationing slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists\nshould all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot\nof merit to that, obviously. Like, look, we want the\nUS to be the world leader in robotics. What step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the\ngreat robotics people, right? Like, you know, very,\nunlike the underpants. No, it's like a very\nstraightforward formula, right? - Yeah. - All right, that's all\nwell and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that you also hear from,\nyou know, these same people, and I have made this\nargument myself many times, which is, we need to do this because we don't have\nenough people in the US who can do it otherwise, right? We have all these unfilled\njobs, we've got all these, you know, all these companies\nthat wouldn't exist. We don't have enough good founders, we don't have enough engineers, we don't have enough scientists. Or then the next version\nof the argument below that is our education\nsystem is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way, 'cause like our education\nsystem is good enough for foreigners to be able\nto come here preferentially in like a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native-born people. So there's like a weird, there's\nlittle cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into and kind of wonder about, and we'll come back to that one. But like, at least, yes, our\neducation system has its flaws. And then underneath that is\nthe argument that, you know, Vivek made, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, you know, native-born\npeople in the country, you know, don't work hard enough, and spend too much time\nwatching TV and TikTok and don't spend enough\ntime studying differential, you know, equations. And again, it's like, all\nright, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair amount to that. Like there's a lot of American\nculture that is, you know, there's a lot of frivolity,\nthere's a lot of, you know, like, I mean, we have\nwell-documented social issues in many fronts, many things that cut\nagainst having a culture of just like straightforward\nhigh achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those\nare the basic arguments. But then I have this kind of\nother side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought\nprocess, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And you know, it's interesting,\nthere's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin\nto, you know, high tech. And so it's like, all right,\nwhy is that exactly, right? And then I know this, I'm an aberration. Like I was the only one\nfrom anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right? I know what an aberration I am, and I know exactly how\nthat aberration happened, and it's a very unusual,\nyou know, set of steps, including, you know,\nmany that were just luck. But like, there is in\nno sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like, not at all. There is also like, in no sense\na talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from\nthe South into high tech. There is no flow from the\nSunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the Deep South into high tech. Just like, literally it's like the blank. There's this whole section of the country that just where the people\njust like for some reason don't end up in tech. Now, that's a little bit strange, 'cause these are the people\nwho put a man on the moon. These are the people who built\nthe World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the Second\nIndustrial Revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network, and built, you know,\nlogistics and transportation in the auto in, I mean,\nthe auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people's\nparents and grandparents and great grandparents\nsomehow had the wherewithal to like build all of\nthis like amazing things, invent all these things. And then there's many,\nmany, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism\nwhere you had people who grew up in the middle of\nnowhere, Philo Farnsworth, who invented the television,\nand just like, you know, tons and tons of others,\nendless stories like this. Now you have a, like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, okay, like what is happening on\nthe blank spot of the map? And then of course, you\nalso can't help noticing that the blank spot on the\nmap, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, \"Oh,\nwell, that's interesting. Like how did that happen?\" Right? And so either you really,\nreally, really have to believe the very, very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you\nhave to believe that like, that basically culture, the\nwhole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country\nis so like, deeply flawed, either inherently flawed\nor culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they are not able to do the\nthings that their, you know, parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess\non what else is happening? - You mean what, affirmative action? - Affirmative action. Okay. (laughs) This is\nvery, think about this, this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. - Right. - Nor does it have any victims at all. - That could explain\nmaybe disproportionate, but like, surely it doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. - What educational institution\nin the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? - But what institution rejected\nfarm boys from Wisconsin? - All of them.\n- All of them. - Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this\nis because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago, these were big court cases. And you know, 'cause the\nidea of affirmative action has been litigated for\nmany, many, many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly\nin the past had upheld that it was a completely\nlegitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative action that\nlike really matter, right? One is the admissions into\neducational institutions, and then the other is jobs, right? Getting hired. Like, those are the two biggest areas. The education one is like super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time, for all, you know, people have written and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments\nfor why it's important, there's many arguments as\nto how it could backfire. It's been this thing. But the Supreme Court upheld\nit for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer, I don't\nhave the exact reference in my head, but there was a\ncase in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O'Connor famously\nwrote that, you know, although it had been 30\nyears of affirmative action, and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended,\nshe said that, you know, well, basically we need to\ntry it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically\nthe issues it's intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming\nup on the 25 years, right? It's a couple years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases is, it's a Harvard case and I think a University\nof North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those\ncases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions\nactually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit\nas cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it's a ring of power. And if you're an admissions\nofficer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power\nto do what you want, and you can justify any of\nit under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases,\nit had been a black box where you didn't have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically\nrequired showing the work. And there was like all kinds\nof like phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there\nwere text messages in there that will just curl your hair of people, of students being spoken of and just like crude racial stereotypes that would just make you\nwant to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. But also, there was\nstatistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is\nthat at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs\nfor SAT that are as wide as 400 points, right? So different groups. So a specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points\nhigher than other ethnicities in order to actually\nget admitted into these. I mean, this is not even about, I mean, white people are a part of this, but like Asians are like\na very big part of this. And actually the Harvard\ncase is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students\nwho were being turned away. And it's basically, I\nmean it's the cliche now in the valley and in\nthe medical community, which is like if you want a super genius, you hire an Asian from Harvard 'cause they are guaranteed\nto be freaking Einstein. 'Cause if they weren't, they were never getting admitted, right? Almost all the qualified\nAsians get turned away. So they've been running this,\nit's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been\na third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really\nchanged the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthey can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a\nsingle education institution in America that is conforming\nwith the Supreme Court ruling. I think they're all\nflagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. - Mostly 'cause of\nmomentum probably, or what? - They are trying to make\nthe world a better place. They're trying to solve\nall these social problems. They are trying to have\ndiverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They're trying to make\ntheir faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they're good people. - [Lex] Right. - They're trying to have\nthe press write nice things about them. Like it's nearly impossible for them. And you know, to be clear,\nlike nobody has been fired from an admissions office for,\nyou know, 25 years of prior, what we now, the Supreme Court now is\nruled to be illegality. And so they're all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so like I, you know, the numbers are moving a little bit, but like, I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they're\ncompliant with the Supreme Court. Like who's in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university's rule of the\nSupreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules\nthe universities, right? Well, another example of that is, I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right\nnow went to either Harvard or Yale, right? Like the level of\nincestuousness here is... Anyway, so there's that. And so this has been running\nfor a very long time. So one is the Harvard and\nUSC cases kind of gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the\nother thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was\nhappening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at\nall the top institutions for Jewish applicants was\nthey were being managed down, either being actively\nmanaged down as a percentage of the base. And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely\nexplicit, basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative\npercentage of the US population, which is 2%. And you know, there's\na whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago,\nJews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big\ncampaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became\n30% of these institutions 'cause there's so many\nsmart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been\ntrying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish\npeople I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, right? And so all of a sudden, so basically, the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this\nin terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in\nterms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? And then, of course, there's the thing that you\nbasically can't talk about, which is all the white\npeople are being excluded. And then it turns out it's\nalso happening to Black people, and this is the thing that like blew my freaking\nmind when I found out about it. So I just assumed that\nlike, this was great news for like American Blacks, because like, you know, obviously\nif you know Whites, Asians and Jews are being excluded,\nthen, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was\nto get the Black population up. And so this must be great\nfor American Blacks. So then I discovered this New\nYork Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? (laughs) - [Lex] Uh-oh. - And again, and by the way,\nthis is in The New York Times, this is not in like, you know, whatever, National Review,\nthis is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that\nwere quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the dean of the\nAfrican-American Studies, you know, community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme\nCourt appointee under, I think she was a close\nfriend of Hillary Clinton. And there was, for a long time, she was on the shortlist\nfor Supreme Court. So one of the top, you know, jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black was sort\nof legendarily successful in the academic and\nlegal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the\nauthorities in this story and the story that they tell, (laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education institutions and\nit's happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government, which\nis at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard\nwere not American-born Blacks. They were foreign-born Blacks, specifically, Northern\nAfrican off generally Nigerian or West Indian, right? And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very\nsuccessful Nigerian-Americans as a group like way outperformed, they're, you know, this a\nsuper smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said\nin the story is Harvard is basically struggling to\neither, whatever it was, identify or recruit, make successful, whatever it was,\nAmerican-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were\nusing high-skill immigration, as an escape hatch to go get\nBlacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs in the last 20 years have had\nthis exact characteristic. There's large numbers of\nBlack people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \"It's obviously not us that\nare getting these slots, we're literally competing with people who are being imported.\" And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action,\nyou are trying to make up for historical injustice\nof American Black slavery. So the idea that you're import\nsomebody from, you know, Nigeria that never\nexperienced that, you know, is like tremendously\ninsulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see\nwhere I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year\nsocial engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into, right? And so it turns out it's\nnot a victim-free thing, there's like 100%, there's victims. 'Cause why? There's only so many, for sure. There's only so many education slots. And then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs, right? You know, Google only\nhires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers, right? And so that's the other side of it, right? And so you're a farm\nboy in Wisconsin, right? You know, Black American\nwhose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship,\n300 years ago, in Louisiana or a, you know, Cambodian\nimmigrant in, you know, the Bronx and you are a kid or a Jewish\nimmigrant or a, you know, or from a very successful Jewish family and you know, your entire, you\nknow, for three generations, you and your parents and\ngrandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those\ngroups know is the system that has been created\nis not for them, right? It's designed specifically\nto exclude them. And then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, \"Yeah, let's bring\nin more foreigners,\" right? And so anyway, so the\nshort version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the, quote,\n\"high-skill immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also\nhaving the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another\nword for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative\naction conversation. And you need to actually\ndeal with this at substance and to see what's actually\nhappening to people. you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for\nhigh-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took\nover both the education process and the hiring process.\n- Okay, so first of all, that was brilliantly laid\nout, the nuance of it. So just to understand, it's\nnot so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to\nbe more people saying, yay, we need more American-born hires. - So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on\nthis and not saying anything, and what I was... (Lex laughing) Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of- - Yeah, that was very Zen. - Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of\nit, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the\ndog that didn't bark, right? And the dog that didn't\nbark was, I did not, and you tell me if you saw one, I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart\nkids who are already here into these educational\ninstitutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. - That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.\n- But it was like literally, it was like the proponents\nof high-skilled immigrant. And again, this was me\nfor a very long time. I mean, I kind of took\nmyself by surprise on this because I was on, you\nknow, I had the much, say, simpler version of this\nstory for a very... And like I said, I've been\nin Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But you know, I've been on\nthe other side of this one, but I was literally sitting\nthere being like, all right, which of these like super\ngeniuses who, you know, many of whom by the\nway are very, you know, successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled\nimmigrants, you know, which of these super\ngeniuses are gonna like, say actually we have this like\nincredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about native-born\nAmericans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure. Those four groups. - But also-\n- Yes. - White people. - Yeah, and also white people. - People that are making the\ncase for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're\nmaking that case are often not making it in a way that's like, making it in quite a radical way. - Yeah.\n- Let's put it this way. - Yeah, but you have\nthis interesting thing, you have a split between\nthe sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. - Right. - Right, and I'm using air\nquote for people listening to audio. I'm making quotes\nin the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can.\n- Yep. - One side has all the certified experts. The other side just has a\nbunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite\nknow how to explain it. And what was so unusual\nabout the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of Supreme Court, is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time, actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record, they actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, 'cause if you don't have\nexperts, what do you have? You know, something is wrong, but you have primarily\nan emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, you know, that\na certified expert can? And no, you can't, like, you\nknow, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. Yeah, and so it's just\nlike, all right, now, by the way, look, I think there are ways\nto square the circle, I think there's a way to\nhave our cake and eat it too, like I think there'd be\nmany ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with\nhigh-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is\nunder much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for\nuniversities to do that, they are still doing it,\nbut they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part, that's happening\nfor a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate\nlawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court\nrulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just as a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let add one more nuance to it that makes it even more complicated. - Yeah. - So the cliche is we're gonna\nbrain drain the world, right? You've heard that? We're gonna take all the smart people from all over the world,\nwe're gonna bring them here, we're gonna educate them, and\nthen we're gonna keep them, and then they're gonna\nraise their families here, create businesses here,\ncreate jobs here, right? - In the cliche, that's\na super positive thing. - Yeah. Okay, so what happens to\nthe rest of the world? - They lose? - Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious,\nhighly conscientious, highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that\nmany and they all come here and they all aren't where\nthey would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So it's almost impossible\nfor us here to have that conversation, in part because we become\nincredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just\nsimply all the same, which is a whole thing\nwe could talk about. But it also, we are purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the\nworld, not the other way around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow\nof high-skilled immigration over time, there's only\nfour permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration\nplaces people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. - Oh, Australia. - It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four\ncountries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk\nabout this I've discovered because the Eurozone\nis, whatever, you know, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over\ntime have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I\nthink it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've\nbeen migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this\nreally hit the fan was in Greece, right? So, you know, Greece falls\ninto chaos, disaster, and then, you know, you're\nrunning the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic\ndevelopment plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. Like, what are you gonna do, right? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. Not because, in part, because of this, 'cause we enthusiastically\nrecruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining\nUkraine for a long time. But also, of course,\nyou know, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, you know, when it comes\ntime for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it\ngonna have the talent base even that it had five years ago is like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, like\nwe have brain drained a lot of really smart people outta Russia, a lot of them are here, right? Over the last, you know, 30 years. And so there's this thing, it's actually really funny\nif you think about it. Like, the one thing that\nwe know to be the height of absolute evil that the\nWest ever did was colonization and resource extraction, right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and\nthe English and you know, everybody else went and had\nthese colonies and then went in and we, you know, took all the oil and we took all the diamonds,\nor we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason we realized\nthat's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's\ncompletely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious\nand beautiful and wonderful and you know, the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral\njustice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one\nsecond what we're doing to the countries that we're\npulling all these people out of. And this is one of these\nthings like, I don't know, like maybe we're just gonna live in this delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't care what happens, but like, I think there may come, this is like one of these submarines 10 feet under the waterline. Like, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly\nrealize, \"Oh, my God, what are we doing?\" 'Cause like, we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? Like we need these other\ncountries to like flourish. Like we don't wanna be the\nonly successful country in the middle of just like\ncomplete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and\nwe extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it. - Well, this is so deeply\nprofound, actually. So what is the cost\n\"winning\" quote, unquote, if these countries are drained\nin terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics,\nwhat does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually\nwant them to be strong in the way we understand\nstrong, not just in every way. So that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. - Yep. - It's interesting, this is one of those\ntruths where you just speak and it resonates, and I\ndidn't even think about it. - [Marc] Yeah, exactly. - So you were sitting\nduring the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that said-\n- Yeah. - There's still to use\nsome good to the H-1B? - Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's- - Come all the way around. (laughs) - There's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance,\nwhich is mostly the valley, we don't use H-1Bs anymore,\nmostly we use O-1s. So there's a separate class of these, and the O-1 is like this, it turns out the O-1 is\nthe super genius visa. So the O-1 is the basically our founder, like when we have somebody\nfrom anywhere in the world and they've like invented a\nbreakthrough new technology, and they wanna come to\nthe US to start a company, they come in through an O-1 visa. And that actually is like\na, it's a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, but it's like a pretty high\nbar. And they do a lot of work and there's like a, you have\nto put real work into it and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened\nwith the H-1B visa program is that it has gone to\nbasically two categories of employers. One is the basically a small\nset of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies\nthat you would think. And then the other is, it goes to these, they call kind of the mills,\nthe consulting mills, right? And so there's these set\nof companies with names, I don't wanna pick on\ncompanies, but you know, names like Cognizant that, you know, hire, basically have their business model is bring in primarily\nIndians in large numbers, and you know, they often have, you know, offices next to company-owned housing. And they'll have, you know,\norganizations that are, you know, they'll have,\nyou know, organizations that are literally thousands\nof Indians, you know, living and working in the US and they do basically call it\nmid-tier, like IT consulting. So you know, these folks,\nthey're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a year or $100,000 a year, not the, you know, 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, like in practice, the startups, basic like\nlittle tech as we call it, or the startup world,\nmainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point and mainly can't, 'cause the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of\nunderlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, you know, Amazon, like Amazon's a\nin like I love Amazon, but like they're a big powerful company. You know, they've got, you\nknow, more money than God. They've got resources, they've got long-term\nplanning horizon, they do big, you know, profound things over,\nyou know, decades at a time. You know, they could, you know, or any of these other companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you know, you'll\nnotice they don't do that. You know, they bring in, you know, 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, like,\nthere's lots of questions around them and whether\nthey should, you know, whether that's even a\nethical way to, you know, I don't wanna say they're\nunethical, but there's questions around like exactly what\nthe trade-offs are there. Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, you know, nobody\nreally wanted to be opened, you know, to play devil's\nadvocate on all this in terms of like national\nimmigration issues, you know, none of this is like a top end issue just 'cause the numbers are small, right? And so, you know, I don't think, you know, the administration has said like, this is not like a priority\nof theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is like, there is actually a lot of\ncomplexity and nuance here. I have a lot of friends,\nlike I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues\nwho are, you know, who came over on H-1Bs,\nor O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens and you know, every single\none that one of them was not every single one, a lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the honor of immigrants throughout\nthis whole period. And they said to me,\nit's like, \"Well, Marc, you know, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance\nof high-skilled immigration to the US?\" And I was like, I think\nyou can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent and be like, do you\nwanna inflame the issue or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right? And I think the answer\nis to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one\nmore positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up\non the university some more. Do you know about the National\nMerit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? - Not really, can you explain? - So there's a system that was\ncreated during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when... It was when people in\ngovernment actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an ideas that sounds today. And so it's basically a\nnational talent search for basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify\nbasically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of\nother characteristics. So there's no race, gender,\nor any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory\nSAT that you take, and then the SAT. So it uses those scores,\nthat is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. So they use the SAT as a\nproxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to like 1% of\nthe population of the kids, 18 year olds any given year\nwho scored highest on the PSAT, and then they get down to\nlike further qualify down to the 0.5% that also\nreplicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right? So it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the\nbest and the brightest. How many of our great and\npowerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities\nall have sports teams, they all have national scouting,\nthey have full-time scouts who go out and they go\nto every high school and they try to find all\nthe great basketball players and bring them into the\nNCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities\nuse the National Merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids\nand just bring them in? - Let me guess, very few. Zero.\n- Zero. (laughs) - As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that\nsame level of scouting for talent internally. - Go get the smartest ones. I'll give you one more\nkicker on this topic if I haven't beaten it to death. You know, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a\nhighly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like\nthe whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the\ncollege board that runs it. And it has been essentially\nlike everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so the in two ways, number one, it's been dumbed down where\nan 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost\nimpossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, right? And so, it's been\ndeliberately dumbed down. And then two is they have tried to pull out a lot of what's\ncalled the g-loading. And so they've tried to detach\nit from being an IQ proxy 'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable, right? So the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has\nreally started to work. And one of the things you\nsee is the Asian spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is\nbecause it's more coachable now. And the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the coaching\nthing is really difficult 'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents\ncan afford coaching, right? And I don't know about\nyou, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT\nwas until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. So, number one, there's issues there, but the other issue there is\nthink about what's happened by the dumbing down,\n800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It's like the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they\nhave AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. 'Cause what you want\nis you want, whatever, if it's gonna be 100,000\nkids, I don't know what it is, it's gonna be 50,000\nkids a year scoring 800. You also then want kids\nto be able to score 900 and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200, and you wanna ultimately get to, you know, you'd like to ultimately\nidentify the top 100 kids and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the\ntest has been reduced, so that it actually is\nnot useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption that's taken place\nthroughout this entire system where we have been heading\nin the reverse direction from wanting to actually go\nget the best and brightest and actually put them in the\nplaces where they should be. And then just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System\nis it's comp, like I said, it's completely race\nblind, it's gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic. It's only done on test scores. You know, and you can make\nan argument about whether that's good or bad, but\nit is, you know, for sure, you know, it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed\nmerit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose\nto do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it like incredibly striking and an enormous moral\nindictment of the current system that there are no universities\nthat do this today. So back to the immigration\nthing, just real quick. It's like, okay, we aren't even trying\nto go get the smart kids out of the center of-\n- Yeah. - And even if they think that they can get into these\nplaces, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for\nthe smart Black people. And like, it's just like,\nI don't know how, like, I don't know how that's moral. Like I don't get it at all. - As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times and I've always gotten\nperfect on math, 800. And I'm not that I'm not special like, it doesn't identify genius. I think you wanna search for genius and you wanna create\nmeasures that find genius of all different kinds,\nspeaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and\nover, defend immigrants. Yes. But say we should hire\nmore and more native-born. - Well, you asked me in the beginning like what's the most optimistic\nforecast, right, that we could have? And the most optimistic\nforecast would be, my God, what if we did both? (laughs) - So that's the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. - Well, it would diffuse the entire issue. - [Lex] Yeah. - If everybody in the center\nin the South of the country and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they\nwere getting a fair shake, like it would diffuse the issue. Like how about diffusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical... Sorry, I don't mean to really get out over my skis here, but- - I think your profile on X\nstates, \"It's time to build.\" It feels like 2025 is\na good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for\nanybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build\nsomething useful in the world or maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch\napps, services, whatever, ship software products. So maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? - So I mean, a big part\nof the answer I think is we're in the middle\nof a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking\nabout this on your show, but like AI coding, I mean,\nthis is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the investment of software. And I'm sure you, and you\nknow, we're involved in various of these companies, but\nyou know, these tools, you know, from a variety of companies are just like absolutely revolutionary and they're getting better by\nleaps and bounds every day. And you know, all this, but like the thing with coding, like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever. But like for sure, we\ncan make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate\nthe results of coding. And so, you know, there's all\nthese methods of, you know, synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is gonna get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean\nanybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and\nlook at AI coding demos, you know, little kids\nmaking apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. I mean I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary. You know, in a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain\nyourself, you know, start using these things, get\na huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more\nquickly than you could before. - That's actually a tricky\none in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like\nyou still need to learn how to code, it becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately\nbe a one person company and get quite far. - I agree with that, up to a point. So I think, for sure,\nfor quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are gonna be the best at\nactually having AI's code things, 'cause they're gonna understand\nwhat I mean, very basic. They're gonna understand\nwhat's happening, right? And they're gonna be able\nbe able to evaluate the work and they're gonna be able to, you know, literally like manage AIs better. Like even if they're not\nliterally handwriting the code, they're just gonna have\na much better sense of what's going on. So I definitely think\nlike 100% my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds of coding classes, and he'll keep doing that\nfor certainly through 18. We'll see after that. And so like for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you\ncan do with an AI is say, teach me how to code, right? And you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, I'll name names,\nyou know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing at\nKhan Academy for free. And then we, you know, we\nhave this company, Replit, which is was originally\nspecifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that's just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this and yeah, that, I mean, the\nAI's gonna be able to teach you to code, AI, by the way, is as you know, spectacularly good at\nexplaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools\nhave these features now where you can talk to the code base and so you can like literally like ask the code base\nquestions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and\npaste code into ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it\nwhat's going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so yeah, there's\ndozens of ways to do this. By the way, you can also, I mean even more broadly than code. Like, okay, you wanna make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art\ngeneration, sound generation, dialogue generation,\nvoice generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like,\nyou don't need designers, you know, you don't need, you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then, you know, a big is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's interfacing\ninto other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments\nor something like that. And, you know, AI's fantastic\nat writing glue code. So, you know, really,\nreally good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you\nfigure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write\na business plan for you. So it's just this, it's\nlike everything happening with AI right now, it's just, it's like this latent superpower and there's this incredible\nspectrum of people who have really figured out\nmassive performance increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't\neven aware it's happening. And there's some gearing to\nwhether you're a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races. And I think there are lots\nof professional coders who are still like, eh... You know, the blacksmiths were\nnot necessarily in favor of, you know, the car business. So yeah, there's the old\nWilliam Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just\nnot evenly distributed yet.\" And this is maybe the most\npotent version of that that I've ever seen. - Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" - Right.\n- It is very common. The programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true. I consider myself\nreasonably good programmer, and my productivity has\nbeen just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming\nis more efficient, more productive, more fun,\nall that kind of stuff. - I would also say code is, you know, code has of anything in\nlike industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the\neasier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's\nunlimited demand for code. Like, in other words, like\nthere's always some other idea for a thing that you can do,\na feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, like overwhelmingly, you know, the amount of code that\nexists in the world is a fraction of even\nthe ideas we have today. And then we come up with\nnew ideas all the time. And so I think that\nlike, (laughs) you know, I was in the late '80s, early '90s, when sort of automated\ncoding systems started to come out, expert systems,\na big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called the \"Decline and Fall of the\nAmerican Programmer,\" you know, that predicted that\nthese new coding systems were gonna mean we wouldn't\nhave programmers in the future. And of course, the number\nof programming jobs exploded by like a factor of 100. Like, my guess is we'll have\nmore coding jobs probably by like an order magnitude\n10 years from now. That will be different,\nthey'll be different jobs. They'll involve orchestrating\nAI, but there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry\nwill just explode in size. - Are you seeing the size\nof companies decrease in terms of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? - All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. - [Lex] Oh, for the big tech? - And little tech.\n- And little tech. - Everybody's trying to\nhire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it's 100%. I mean, there's a handful\nof company, you know, there's a little bit,\nthere's customer service, you know, we have some\ncompanies and others 'cause I think it's\nKlarna that's publicizing a lot of this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. But like for engineering jobs, like, it's just an explosion of hiring that at least, so far, there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am\nlooking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first\ncompany to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. So basically, the companies that we see are\nbasically one of two kinds. We see the companies that are basically sometimes\nuse weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies,\nI sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point\non whatever they're doing. - (laughs) Sure. - Right? And it's on the slide, right?\n- Yeah. - So they've got the, you know, whatever, da, da, da, da, da, and then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is, 'cause they had already\npreviously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the\nsix bullet point in the slide, which is how you're\ngetting all these products that have like the AI button\nup in the corner, right? The little sparkly button. - Yep.\n- Right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which\nI'm like, I don't need that. Like, I need you to answer\nmy email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay, so we see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then we see the strong\nform, which is the companies that are building from\nscratch for AI, right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally\nan AI email system, as an example, so just- - Oh, nice. I can't wait. - Yeah, they're gonna completely. So the very obvious idea,\nvery smart team, you know, it's gonna be great. And then, you know,\nNotion, just, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a\nproduct. And so now companies are gonna basically come through, sweep through, and they're gonna do\nbasically AI-first versions of basically everything. And those are like\ncompanies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. - Yeah, Cursor is an example of that. They basically said, okay,\nwe're gonna rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. - What if we knew from scratch\nthat we could build on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the Full Employment Act\nfor startups and VCs is, it just like if a\ntechnology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development\nprocess over from scratch, 'cause you need to\nreconceptualize the product, and then usually what that\nmeans is you need a new company 'cause most incumbents just won't do that. And so, yeah. So that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for is the\ncompany where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned\nas a result of AI, right? So I'm looking at, I'm\nwaiting for the company where it's like, no, we're\ngonna have, like, you know, and the cliche, here's a\nthought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're gonna have like the human executive team, and then we're gonna have the\ntheis be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of engineering\nsupervising 100 instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right by the way, or maybe the VP of\nengineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs, right? 'Cause one of the things that\nAI should be pretty good at is managing 'cause it's\nlike not, you know, it's like a process-driven,\nit's the kind of thing that AI's actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so should it be an AI executive team? You know, and then, of\ncourse, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, right? You know, and then maybe\nthe most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set\none of these things loose and let it basically\nbuild itself a business? And so I will say like\nwe're not yet seeing those, and I think there's a little bit of, the systems aren't quite\nready for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, like a founder who's really willing to break all the rules and\nreally willing to take the swing. And those people exist, and\nso I'm sure we'll see that. - And some of it is, as you\nknow, with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have\na AI-first email client, seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail\nis really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google\ncan't do it, because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer\nthe entirety of the system. 'Cause feels like Google's\nperfectly positioned to do it. Same with like, you have\nPerplexity, which I love, like Google could technically\ntake on Perplexity and do it much better,\nbut they haven't, not yet. So it's fascinating why\nthat is for large companies. I mean that is an\nadvantage for little tech, they could be agile. - Yeah, that's right.\n- They can move fast. - Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can't-\n- Right. - This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in\n\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which is sometimes when big\ncompanies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too much glass. It would specifically, it would interfere with\ntheir existing customers and their existing businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly,\nthey shouldn't do that, right? And so they just get, this is Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they're well-run, not\nbecause they're poorly run. But they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing against\nthe existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Like every once in a while, one breaks the pattern\nand actually does it. But for the most part, like this is a very predictable\nform of human behavior, and this fundamentally\nis why startups exist. - It feels like 2025 is\nwhen the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. Like, it's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI. Who do you think wins the AI race? - I would say, I'm not gonna predict, I'm gonna say there's\nquestions all over the place. And then we have this\ncategory question we call the trillion-dollar\nquestion, which is like, literally depending on how it's answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there's like, I don't know, 5 or $6 trillion questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I'll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small models. Another is open models\nversus closed models. Another is whether you can\nuse synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political\ntrillion-dollar questions. You know, policy\nquestions, which, you know, the US and the EU have both\nbeen flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is\nabout to really succeed at. Yeah, and then there's\nprobably another, you know, half dozen big important\nquestions after that. And so these are all just\nlike, say, this is an industry that's in flux in a way\nthat I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious\nexample of the flux is you know, sitting here\nless than three years ago, sitting here in December of '22, we would've said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today,\nit's like, you know, there's at least six, you know, world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of\nthe most shocking things to me, is like, it turns out that once\nyou know that it's possible to build one incredibly\nsmart Turning-test-passing large language model,\nwhich was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it\nturns out within, you know, a year, you can have five more. There's also a money\ncomponent thing to it, which is to get the money\nto scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There's basically right now\nonly two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers\ngiving you the money, which you turn around and\nroundtrip back to them. Or, you know, foreign\nsovereigns, other, you know, country sovereign wealth\nfunds, which can be, you know, difficult in some\ncases, for companies to access. So there's maybe another\ntrillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here's one. So Sam Altman has been\npublic about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a nonprofit,\nbeing a for-profit. The way that is legally done is that, and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and and other legal entities, government entities,\nscrutinizes very carefully, 'cause the US takes foundation\nnonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so the way that historically, the way that you do it\nis you start a for-profit and then you raise money\nwith the for-profit to buy the assets of the\nnonprofit at fair market value. And, you know, the last\nfinancing round at OpenAI was, you know, 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the\nflip is going to happen, the for-profit has to\ngo raise $150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. You know, raising 150\nbillion is a challenge. So, you know, is that even possible? If that is possible, then\nOpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, you know, I don't know. And then, you know,\nobviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the\nmarket leader today, you know, there's big important questions there. You know, Microsoft has this\nkind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind, but you know, they're\nvery good at catching up. Amazon, you know, is\nprimarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. - And then there's the other questions, like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly,\nopen versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. And then test on compute\nwith chain of thought. They're all of that. And it's just fascinating. And these are, I think it's fair to say,\ntrillion-dollar questions. - Yeah, these are big, like\nlook, you know, it's like, okay, here's a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations, right? Like, so if you are trying to\nuse these tools creatively, you're thrilled because\nthey can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this\nincredible stuff, right? They're creative. The flip side of that is if\nyou need them to be correct, they can't be creative. And that's, you know,\nthe term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And you know, there have been,\nyou know, court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court\ncitations, case citations. The judge is like, \"Wait a\nminute, this doesn't exist.\" And the very next is, \"Did\nyou write this yourself?\" And the lawyer goes, \"Er-\" (laughs) - I mean that's why with Elon, with Grok-\n- Yes. - Looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? - Yeah, that's right. And my sense is this very\ncontentious topic at the industry, my sense is if to the extent that there is a domain in\nwhich there is a definitive and checkable provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to\ngenerate synthetic data. You should be able to do\nchain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do\nreinforcement learning, and you should be able\nto ultimately, you know, eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that's a trillion-dollar\nquestion right there as to whether that's true. But then there's question of like, okay, is that gonna work in\nthe more general domain? Like, so for example, one\npossibility is these things are gonna get truly superhuman\nlike math and coding. But at like discussing\nphilosophy, they're gonna just, they're basically as smart\nas they're ever gonna be. And they're gonna be kind of, you know, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they're already outta training data. Like they literally, if, you know, you talk to these people,\nlike literally the big models, the big models are like\nwithin a factor of 2X of consuming all the\nhuman-generated training data to the point that some of these big companies are\nliterally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean\nthat like you have to, if you want your model\nto better philosophy, you have to go hire like\na thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody gonna do that? And so, you know, maybe these things are\ntopping out in certain ways and they're gonna leap\nway ahead in other ways. And so anyway, so we just\ndon't, you know, this is... Actually, maybe my main\nmain conclusion is, anybody telling, you know, anybody telling you these\nbig sweeping conclusions, you know, this whole super, you know, all of these abstract\ngeneralized super intelligence AGI stuff like, you know, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like, that's to abstract like,\nit's gotta actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have\nto be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem\nright now with the, you know, the big models that are like\nreally good at coding and math, they're like actually very\nexpensive to run, you know, they're quite slow. Another trillion-dollar\nquestion, future chips, which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean, all the global issue. Oh, another trillion-dollar\nquestion censorship, right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly, what are you\ntraining these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long did they give you these... How often do they give you these incredibly preaching moral lectures? Here's a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries\nwant their country to run its education system,\nhealthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing\nCalifornia politics, right? 'Cause that's kind of what\nthey have on offer right now. And I think the answer\nto that is not very many. So there's like massive\nopen questions there about like what, you know, and by\nthe way, like what morality of these things are gonna\nget trained on as a- - And that one we're cracking wide open with what's been happening\nover the past few months. Censorship on every\nlevel of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to be expand\nthe Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. - So what I experienced,\nyou know, going back to how we started, what I\nexperienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at like large scale, and then the war on the crypto\nindustry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared\nintent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under\nthe same kind of censorship and control regime as\nsocial media and the banks. And I think this election\ntipped, in America, I think this election\ntipped us from a timeline in which things were going to\nget really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are gonna be quite good. But look, those same questions\nalso apply outside the US and you know, the EU is doing their thing, they're being extremely draconian and they're trying to lock in\na political censorship regime on AI right now that's so harsh that even American AI\ncompanies are not even willing to launch new products\nin the EU right now. Like, that's not gonna last, but like, what happens there, right? And what are the trade-offs? You know, what levels of censorship are American companies\ngonna have to sign up for if they wanna operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them,\n(laughs) so that they can't? So big questions. - Quick questions. So you're very active on X. A very unique character, flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a meme, I\ndon't remember it exactly, but that Elon posted\nsomething like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I\nthink, you know, doing the, I take a big step back and\nfuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside\nyour mind when you're tweeting? - To be clear, a reference from the comedy\nclassic \"Tropic Thunder.\" - \"Tropic Thunder,\" yeah. Legendary movie. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Any Zoomers listening\nto this who haven't seen that movie, go watch it immediately. - Yeah, there's nothing\noffensive about it. - Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise's greatest performance. (Lex laughing) So-\n- Yeah. - Yeah, no, look, I should\nstart by saying like, I'm not supposed to be\ntweeting at all, so- - Yeah.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So, but, you know. - So how do you approach that? Like how do you approach what to tweet? - I mean, I don't. I don't well enough. It's mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there's a glory to it and there's an issue with it,\nand the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global\ncommunication, you know, X in particular is, you know, the town square on all these,\nyou know, social issues, political issues, everything\nelse, current events. But I mean, look, there's\nno question of the format. The format of at least\nthe original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I was tweeted something. It turned out that it's\nstill politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news\nin each time zone in India for a single tweet. So like, the single tweet outta context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously, X now has the\nmiddle ground where they, you know, they now have\nthe longer form essays. And so, you know, probably\nthe most productive thing I can do is longer form things. - You're not gonna do it though, are you? - [Marc] I do, I do,\nfrom time-to-time. I do. - Sometimes.\n- I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean,\nlook, but, and yeah, and obviously, X is doing great. And then, like I said,\nlike Substack, you know, has become the center for a\nlot, you know, a lot of the, I think the best kind of,\nyou know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly\nintellectual content, you know, tons of current events\nstuff there as well. And then, yeah, so, and then there's a bunch\nof other, you know, a bunch of new systems\nthat are very exciting. So I think one of the\nthings we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive\nreinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen with that. And it's happened on X, but it's now gonna happen\non other platforms. And then the other is crypto's gonna come right back to life. And actually that's\nvery exciting, actually, that's worth noting is that's another\ntrillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal\neconomic system for that, right? 'Cause it's a programmable money, it's a very easy way\nto plug in and do that. And there's this transaction\nprocessing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto\nAI intersection, you know, is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was gonna be\nimpossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do. - Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite\nthings about Yann LeCun? (Marc laughing) I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree\non a lot of things, but I personally like\nvigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the\ngladiators go at it, and- - No, he's a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn't\nsay we're super close, but you know, casual friends. I worked with him at Meta, you know, he is the chief scientist\nat Meta for a long time and is still, you know, works with us. And obviously is a legendary\nfigure in the field and one of the main people\nresponsible for what's happening. My serious observation would be that it's the thing I keep,\nI've talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does\nis he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree\nwith this, he is the smartest and most credible critic\nof LLMs is the path for AI. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's not, you know, there's certain, I would say troll-like characters who are just like crapping everything. But like Yann has like very\ndeeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. And I actually, like,\nI try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,\nI try to have a mental model of like the two different\nsides of a serious argument. And so I've tried to like\ninternalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult 'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like\nthat could be a big problem. But like, we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the\nbullish people, you know, to really kind of test\ntheir level of knowledge. So I like to kind of grill people. Like, you know, I was got\nmy CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like to the extent I can\nunderstand Yann's points, I can use them to, you know,\nto really surface a lot of the questions for the\npeople who are more bullish. And that's been, I think,\nvery, very productive. Yeah, just, and it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, who is actually like a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he\nwill provoke the evolution of these systems to be much\nbetter than they would've been. - Yeah, he could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the\nLLM path to AGI, you know, his basic notions that\nthere needs AI needs to have some physical understanding\nof the physical world, and that's very difficult\nto achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations\nof LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source.\n- Yes. - Which is a whole nother-\n- Yes. - Which you have been as well. - [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah. - And that's been just\nfascinating to watch. - [Marc] And anti-doomer. - Anti-doomer?\n- Yeah. - Yeah, he's-\n- He's very anti-doomer. - He embodies... He also has many wolves inside. - [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes, he does. Yes, does. - So it's been really,\nreally fun to watch. - The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. - [Lex] Yeah. - The other two of the\nthree godfathers of AI are like radicals, like full-on left, you know,\nfar left, you know, like, I would say like either\nMarxists or borderline Marxists. And they're like, I think, quite extreme in\ntheir social political views. And I think that feeds\ninto their doomerism, and I think, you know, they are lobbying for\nlike draconian government, I think what would be ruinously\ndestructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Yann as a\ncounterpoint to those two. - Another fun question, our\nmutual friend Andrew Huberman. - [Marc] Yes. - First maybe, what do you\nlove most about Andrew? And second, what score\non a scale of 1 to 10 do you think he would give you\non your approach to health? - Oh, three. - Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.\n- (laughs) Exactly. - That's good. (laughs)\n- Exactly. Well, so he convinced me\nto stop drinking alcohol, which was a big-\n- Successfully? - Well, it was like other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world.\n- Yeah. - And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night, it was like a major, like, it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly\nnegatively impacted my emotional health. (Lex laughing) I blame him-\n- Yeah. - For making me much\nless happy as a person. But much, much, much healthier. - Yeah.\n- Physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have no interest in\nhis sleep shit. Like, no. This whole light, natural light, no, we're not doing it. - You're too hardcore for this? - I don't see any natural light in here. - [Lex] It's all covered. It's all horrible. - And I'm very happy. I would be very happy\nliving and working here 'cause I'm totally happy\nwithout natural light. - In darkness.\n- Yes. - It must be a metaphor for something. - Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have\na blue screen in your face for three hours and\nthen go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why you should wanna take shortcuts. - I now understand what they\nmean by toxic masculinity. All right. (both laughing) So let's see. You're exceptionally\nsuccessful by most measures, but what to you is the\ndefinition of success? - I would probably say it is\na combination of two things, I think it is contribution. So, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately, you know, and specifically\nit mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not\nmean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said, \"Pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to\nsatisfaction or fulfillment. And so I think about happiness as the first ice cream\ncone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice\ncream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of\nthe walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Right, and so happiness is\nthis very fleeting concept, and the people who\nanchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I dunno how to put it useful. - So that's a good place\nto arrive at in life. - Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah. You know, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But like, if you're sitting in a room by yourself and you're like, all right. Or you know, four in the\nmorning, it's like, all right, have I lived up to my\nexpectation of myself? Like if you have, you know,\nthe people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and, you know, generally seem\nvery, I dunno how to put it, pleased with, you know,\nproud, calm, at peace. The people who are, you\nknow, sensation seekers, you know, some of the sensations\nby the way, some sense, you know, there's certain\nentrepreneurs, for example, who are like into every\nform of extreme sport and they get, you know, huge\nsatisfaction out of that. Or, you know, there's sensation seeking in sort of useful and productive ways. You know, Larry Ellison\nwas always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, there's\na lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know,\ndrugs, (laughs) you know, like you know, sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun\nat first and then backfire. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM- - [Marc] Yeah.\n- And I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM- - Yeah.\n- With a blue screen. - That's good. Exactly. - Staring at cursor.\n- Exactly. - As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an\namazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and\njust to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called,\n\"Honestly, with Bari Weiss.\" She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys... See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. - [Marc] Thank you. - So this question is designed for many of the questions today\nwere designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause\nthat you're not sure. So it felt like the\npause, the uncertainty, there was some kind of\nongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching\nfor wisdom and meaning? - I guess I'd put it this way. There's a lot to just\nunderstand about people that I feel like I'm only\nstarting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler\nconcept than God. (laughs) So that's what I've spent a\nlot of the last, you know, 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my\nfirst like whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I'm spending 30\nyears figuring out people, which turns out to be quite\na bit more complicated. And then, I don't know,\nmaybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look,\nI mean just, you know, like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is like\nvery, you know, complicated and, you know, mystifying. I mean, every time I, you\nknow, pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, you know, \"Daddy, how many galaxies\nare there in the universe?\" And you know, how many galaxies are\nthere in the universe? - 100 billion?\n- Okay. Like how? (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - Like-\n- Yeah. - Like how that freaking possible? Like it's such a\nstaggering concept that I- - I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from\nElon from a while back. Elon, said, \"As a friend called it, this\nis the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies, a billion light years across.\"\n- Yeah. - So these are all galaxies.\n- Yeah. Like how was it that big? Like how the hell, and like, you know, I can read the textbook\nand the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion\nyears and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all\nrights, the Big Bang. All right, like what was\nbefore the Big Bang? (laughs) - Do you think we humans will\never colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? - Sure. Yeah, I mean,\nin the fullness of time. Yeah. - So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across a thousand of-\n- In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah, you know, all the problem, all the\nchallenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it'll take a long time. - You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? - No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately\nwe have Elon giving us, (Lex laughing) giving us the backup plan. So I don't know, like,\nI grew up, you know, real Midwest, sort of\njust like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an\nengineer and a scientist. I'm like, \"Oh, that definitely\ndoesn't make sense.\" I'm like, \"I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll figure everything out.\" And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against\nthese things, you know, you bump up against these things and you're just like, \"All right,\" I like, \"Okay, I guess there's\na scientific explanation for this, but like, wow.\" And then there's like, \"All right, where did that come from?\" Right, and then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean,\nand even just, you know, experiences that we all have on earth, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, I guess I just say I'm kind\nof radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that\nI'll probably never know. The other thing though, that's happened, and maybe the more practical\nanswer to the question is I think I have a much\nbetter understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great... I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, \"If a man does\nnot have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\" And so there's this class,\nit's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing\npoint of view, which is, \"Yes, I'm an atheist,\nbut it's very important that the people believe in something.\" Right? And Marx had like the\nnegative view on that, which is religions the\nopiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like\nright-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it's deeply important that the people be Christian\nor something like that. And on the one hand it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right because, you know, what have we learned in the last 100 years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's\nthis political philosopher who's super interesting on\nthis named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the sort\nof mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was like born in, I think, like 1900, and like died in like '85. So he saw the complete run\nof communism and Nazism and himself, you know, I think he fled Europe and\nyou know, the whole thing. And you know, his sort of\nbig conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but like in the deep way of religions. Like, you know, we call\n'em political religions, but they were like actual religions. And you know, they were\nwhat Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, \"God is dead. We've killed him, and we won't\nwash the blood off our hands for 1,000 years,\" right? Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just\nmass murder and death. And like, you read his stuff now and you're like, \"Yep,\n(laughs) that happened.\" Right? And then, of\ncourse, as fully, you know, elite moderates, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing\nthat for ourselves right now, but of course, we are. And you know, I would argue\nthat Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the\nlast 10 years, you know, we have been in a\nreligious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full\nscale religious frenzy and has had all of the\ncharacteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to, you know, sin. Wokeness has said, every, I think, has said every single aspect of an actual religion other\nthan redemption, right? Which is maybe like the\nmost dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's\nno forgiveness, right? And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would've\nzeroed right in on that, would've said that. And, you know, we just\nlike sailed right off. I mentioned earlier like\nwe somehow rediscovered the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity\npolitics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, like there is\nsomething very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and\nneeds to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles\nwith the specifics of it. - I think I speak for a lot of people that it's been a real joy and for me, an honor to get to\nwatch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You're in that 30-year part of your life, and it's been an honor\nto talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That's only, how long is that? - Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so- - I'll accept being one of the short ones. (both laughing) - For the listener. Marc looks like he's ready\nto go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. (laughs) Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Thomas Sowell. \"It takes considerable knowledge\njust to realize the extent of your own ignorance.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time.",

    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

    "content": "- I mean, look, we're\nadding a trillion dollars to the national debt\nevery 100 days right now, and it's now passing the size of the Defense Department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon, it's gonna be adding a\ntrillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be adding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't\nget fixed, at some point, we enter a hyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil and- - The following is a conversation\nwith Marc Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. Marc is a visionary\ntech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the\ntech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential\nvoices in the tech world, including at the intersection\nof technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the\nbest possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small\ntech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario\ntrajectory for America. - The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.\n- The roaring '20s. I mean, look, couple things. It is remarkable over\nthe last several years with all of the issues\nincluding, you know, not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every\nother thing that's happened. It's really amazing, the United\nStates just kept growing. If you just look at\neconomic growth charts, the US just kept growing,\nand very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing,\nGermany has stopped growing, and you know, some of those countries may be actually growing\nbackwards at this point. And there's a very long\ndiscussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's of course, plenty of things that are\nwrong with our country, but the US is just flat\nout primed for growth. And I think that's a consequence\nof many factors, you know, some of which are lucky and\nsome of which through hard work. And so the lucky part is\njust, you know, number one, you know, we just have like\nincredible physical security by being our own continent. You know, we have incredible\nnatural resources, right? There's this running joke now that like, whenever it looks like\nthe US is gonna run out of some like rare earth\nmaterial, you know, some farmer in North Dakota\nlike kicks over a hay bale and finds like a $2 trillion deposit. Right, I mean, we're just like blessed, you know, with geography\nand with natural resources. Energy. You know, we can be energy\nindependent anytime we want. This last administration\ndecided they didn't wanna be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has\ndeclared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There's no question we\ncan be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It's purely a question of choice, and I think the new\nadministration's gonna do that. And oh, and then I would\nsay two other things. One is, you know, we\nare the beneficiaries, and, you know, you're an example of this. We're a beneficiary. We're the beneficiary of,\nyou know, 50, 100, 200 years of like the basically\nmost aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people, you know, moving to the US and\nraising their kids here. And so we just have, you know, we're by far the\nmost dynamic population, most aggressive. You know, we're the most\naggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country, and have been for a long\ntime, and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the\nadvanced technology leader. You know, we have our\nissues and we have a... I would say particular\nissue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for, you know, anything\nin software, anything in AI, anything in, you know,\nall these, you know, advanced biotech, all these\nadvanced areas of technology, like we're by far the leader. Again, in part 'cause many\nof the best scientists and engineers in those fields, you know, come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for a just a monster boom. You know, I could see\neconomic growth going way up. I could see productivity\ngrowth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a\nglobal tour, if you like, but like, basically, all of our competitors\nhave like profound issues and, you know, we could kind\nof go through them one by one, but the competitive\nlandscape just is, it's like, it's remarkable how much better positioned\nwe are for growth. - What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical questions. You know, I travel across the world and there's something\nabout the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be\nthe Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? - Yeah. So is this a family\nshow or am I allowed to swear? - You could say whatever\nthe fuck you want. - (laughs) Okay. So the great TV show, \"Succession,\" the show, of course, which\nyou were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.\n- Yes. - The best line from \"Succession\"\nwas in the final episode of the first season\nwhen the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral\nhomeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle,\nyou know, for some wedding. And Logan is just like\ncompletely miserable, have to having to, you know, 'cause he is been in\nNew York for 50 years, he's totally miserable\nbeing back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here and go back to America where\nwe can fuck without condoms.\" (both laughing) - Was that a metaphor or... Okay.\n- Exactly. Right. And so no, but it's exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what, like-\n- Yeah. - Everybody watching that\ninstantly starts laughing 'cause you know what it means,\nwhich it's exactly this. I think there's like an\nethnographic, you know, way of it. There's a bunch of\nbooks on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all\nthe different derivations of all the different ethnic\ngroups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. Right, and what we have is\nthis sort of amalgamation of like, you know, the\nNortheast, you know, Yankees who are like super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are\nsuper aggressive, you know, we've got the, you know, the Southerners and the Texans, you know, and you know, the sort of, you\nknow, whole kind of blended, you know, kind of\nAnglo-Hispanic thing, you know, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, you know, capable characters. You know, the Texas Rangers,\nyou know, we've got the, yeah, we've got the California, you\nknow, we've got the, you know, the wild, we've got the\nincredibly, you know, inventive hippies, but we also\nhave the hardcore engineers. We've got, you know, the best, you know, rocket scientists in the world. We've got the best, you\nknow, artists in the world, you know, creative professionals,\nyou know, the best movies. And so yeah, there is, you know, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, you\nknow, in my view to some extent, you know, attempts to\nbasically sand all that off and make everything basically\nboring and mediocre. But there is something\nin the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just\nneed people to stand up at a certain point and say, you know, \"It's time to build, it's time to grow, you know,\nit's time to do things.\" And there's something\nin the American spirit that just like roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I actually saw, you know, I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s, you know, 'cause the '70s were like horribly depressing, right? In the US. Like they were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has\nfelt a lot like the '70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating,\nyou know, negative attitude and everybody's upset about everything. And, you know, and then by\nthe way, like energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization, right? You know, the low point for\nin the '70s was, you know, Jimmy Carter who just passed away. He went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech. And it was like the weakest possible, trying to like rouse people\nback to a sense of like passion, he completely failed. And, you\nknow, we had the, you know, the hostages in, you know,\nIran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly\nnews, it was, you know, lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then, you know, Reagan came in and, you know, Reagan was a\nvery controversial character at the time, and, you know, he came in\nand he is like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're gonna do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and, you know, roared really\nhard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what... I think, you know, we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. - And I just did a super long\npodcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible\nprofessor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic.\n- Yes. - And one of which maybe\nyou can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual\nfreedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just\nin general, individualism. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and as you know this, America has this incredible\nstreak of individualism, you know, individualism in\nAmerica probably peaked, I think between roughly call\nit the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably\ncall it 1931 or something, you know, and there was\nthis like incredible rush. I mean, that period, you know, we now know that period as the\nSecond Industrial Revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then, you know, that led to, you know, ultimately then therefore\nbeing able to, you know, not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II\nand then win the Cold War. And yeah, you know, massive\nindividualistic streak. By the way, you know,\nMilton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring.\n- Yep. - As they were then, you know, he is a singular figure and many of us, you\nknow, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of\npeople who worked with him and you know, he was a singular figure, but all of his lessons, you know, live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's\nnot just individualism, and this is, you know, this\nis one of the big things, it's like playing out\nin a lot of our culture and kind of political fights\nright now, which is, you know, basically this feeling, you\nknow, certainly that I have and I share with a lot\nof people, which is, it's not enough for America\nto just be an economic zone. And it's not enough for\nus to just be individuals, and it's not enough to\njust have line go up, and it's not enough to\njust have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also, you know,\nthere's more to a country than just that. And you know, quite frankly,\na lot of it is intangible. A lot of it is, you know,\ninvolve spirit and passion. And you know, like I said, we have more of it than\nanybody else, but, you know, we have to choose to want it. The way I look at, it's\nlike all of our problems are self-inflicted. Like, you know, decline is a choice. You know, all of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, you know, basically people telling us, people in positions of\nauthority telling us that, you know, \"We shouldn't,\nyou know, stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous,\nwe shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, you know, we shouldn't this,\nthat, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about\neverything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think\npeople are done with it. - If we could go on a\ntangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book \"The Ancient City.\"\n- Yes. - By, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa\nDenis Fustel de Coulanges, I don't know. - That was amazing. - Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said, this is an\nimportant book to understand who we are and where we come from. - So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by\nthis guy as a (indistinct). I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language\npronunciations for the day. He was a professor classics\nat the Sorbonne in Paris, you know, the top university,\nactually in the 1860s, so actually, right around\nafter the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a\nparticular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the\nbook as he had apparently read, and, you know, sort of absorbed and memorized every\npossible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about\nGreek and Roman culture, and that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none\nof that has changed, right? And so he had access to the\nexact same written materials that we have access to, and you know, we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he\ndid is he went back further. He reconstructed the people\nwho came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their\nlife and society was like. And these were the\npeople who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you\nmay have heard of these are the people who came\ndown from the steppes. And so they came out of what's\nnow like Eastern Europe, like around sort of the\noutskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of\nswept through Europe. They ultimately took over\nall of Europe, by the way, you know, almost many of the\nethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years\nthat follow, you know, are Indo-European. And so like, you know, they were this basically this warrior, basically class that like\ncame down and swept through and you know, essentially, you know, populated much of the world. And there's a whole\ninteresting saga there. But what he does, and then they basically, from there came basically\nwhat we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind\nof evolutions off of that. And so what he reconstructs\na sort of what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind\nof original social state. And the significance of that\nis the original social state is this is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no\ntechnology, (laughs) right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got the clothes on your back, you've got your, you know, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you know, predates\nbasically all concepts of technologies as we\nunderstand 'em today. And so these are people\nunder like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social\npatterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern\nbasically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero\nconcept of individual rights and essentially no\nconcept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set\nof tribes would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what\nNietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality,\nanything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it's very clear why that is, right? It's 'cause strong equals\ngood equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is it more important\nfor you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, you know, live as a slave on your\nknees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted\nthat moral framework. But it, you know, the\noriginal framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally\nobligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. (laughs) Right, you were morally required to. Like, if you didn't do\nit, you were a bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time\nwith no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives\nis that it's a collective you know, and people are\nsharing and of course, that limited how big they could get 'cause you know, the\nproblem with communism is it doesn't scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it\nwork at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately\ntied into their religion. And their religion was,\nit was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors\nis extremely important because it was basically the\nancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the\npeople who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of nature 'cause of course, nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city\nhad their ancestor gods, and then they had their nature gods. Okay, so fast-forward to today, like we live in a world that\nis like radically different, and the book takes you\nthrough kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans, through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because\nthe conventional view of the progress through time\nis that we are, you know, the cliche is the arc of the\nmoral universe, you know, bend towards justice, right? Or so-called wig history,\nwhich is, you know, that the arc of progress\nis positive, right? And so, you know, what\nyou hear all the time, what you're taught in school\nand everything is, you know, every year that goes by,\nwe get better and better and more and more moral\nand more and more pure and a better version of ourselves, our Indo-European ancestors would say, \"Oh, no, like you people\nhave like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically your civilization, and you have diluted\nthem down to the point where they barely even matter. You know, and you're having, you know, children outta a wedlock and you're, you know, you\nregularly encounter people of other cities and you\ndon't try to kill them.\" And like, how crazy is that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an\nincredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious,\nhighly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can't resist noting\nthat as a consequence of basically going through\nall the transitions we've been through, going all the way through\nChristianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We're in a secular society,\nyou know, that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but you know, largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved,\nmodern secular, you know, expert, scientists and so\nforth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact\nsame religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had,\nspecifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics\nand nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, worked our way all the way\nback to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show\nthat like, you know, in some ways we have fallen\nfar from the family tree, but in some cases, we're exactly the same. - You kind of described this\nprogressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. - Identity politics is\nworshiping ancestors, right?\n- Yeah. - It's tagging newborn\ninfants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've\nrecognized it on sight. We somehow think it's like\nsuper socially progressive. - Yeah. And it is not. - I mean, I would say obviously not. You know, get nuanced, which\nis where I think you're headed, which is look like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent\nsociety every generation, and have no regard whatsoever\nfor what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea, right? That's like the Cambodians\nwith Year Zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up\neverything that came before and create something new\nin the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing, you know,\nenormous destruction. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, there is like a deeply\nimportant role for tradition. And the way I think\nabout that is the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And you know, this is what\nIndo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled\nwisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and\npowerful lessons learned. And that's why I think\nit's fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is 'cause that's part of the history and you know, part of the learning that got us to where we're today. Having said that, there are\nmany cultures around the world that are, you know, mired\nin tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that's the default human\ncondition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in\nsocieties in which, you know, there's like absolute\nseniority by age, you know, kids are completely... You know, like in the\nUS, like for some reason, we decided kids are in\ncharge of everything, right? And like, you know,\nthey're the trendsetters and they're allowed to\nlike, set all the agendas and like set all the politics\nand set all the culture and maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. 'Cause it's the old\npeople who are in charge of everything, you know,\nthey're gerontocracies, and it's all a bunch of\n80-year-olds running everything, which by the way, we have a\nlittle bit of that too, right? And so what I would say is like, there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is\ncommunitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you\nknow, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, I mean, it just\ndoesn't get you anywhere. Like, it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a society living\nin the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in\nall the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, you know, I think it probably, this is one of those things\nwhere extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. - So the beautiful picture you\npainted of the roaring '20s, how can the Trump\nadministration play a part in making that future happen? - Yeah, so look, a big part of this is getting the government\nboot off the neck of the American economy, the\nAmerican technology industry, the American people. You know, and again, this\nis a replay of what happened in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know, for what started out looking\nlike, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you\nknow, we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I describe as sort of a\nform of soft authoritarianism. You know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's not like, you know, you\nget thrown into Lubyanka. You know, for the most part, it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know,\nincredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vetocracy, right? What's required to get anything done? You know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything,\nany one of them can veto it. You know, there's a lot of (indistinct)\npolitical system works. And then, you know, just this\ngeneral idea of, you know, progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses\nis bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome,\nyou know, basically anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. Anybody who's wrong\nabout anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this\nvery kind of, you know, grinding repression. And then coupled with\nspecific government actions such as censorship regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, you know, critical American industries and then, you know,\ncongratulating yourselves on the back for doing it, or, you know, having these\nhorrible social policies, like let's let all the\ncriminals outta jail and see what happens, right? And so, like we've just\nbeen through this period, you know, I call it a\ndemoralization campaign. Like we've just been through\nthis period where, you know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being\nthis comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible\nand if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration\nreached kinda the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many\nfronts at the same time. And so just like relieving that and getting kind of back\nto a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic,\nconstructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind,\nthere's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is gonna, I think,\ncause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of\nthings proactively that, yeah. And then there's a lot\nof things proactively that could be done. - So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically\npermeated government and permeated big companies? - Disclaimer at first, which is I don't wanna predict\nanything on any of this stuff 'cause I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics\nor Washington at all. But I would just say that\nthe plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration\nand that they plan to take, you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're gonna do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they're gonna do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they're gonna move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. Like, I mean, you know, we just saw a great example\nof this with what, you know, with what Mark Zuckerberg\nis doing, you know, and obviously I'm\ninvolved with his company, but you know, we just saw it\nkind of in public, the scope, and speed of the changes, you know, are reflective of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry, right? And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump\nor anti-Trump, like, there's just like a giant vibe shift mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a\ngroup of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still, you know, people who at least vocally\nwere still very anti-Trump, but I said, you know, \"Has anything changed since November 6th?\" And they immediately said, \"Oh, it's completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. You know, woke is over.\" You know, they said that\nall kinds of projects are gonna be able to get\nmade now they couldn't before that, you know, Hollywood's gonna start\nmaking comedies again. You know, like, they were just, just like an incredible\nimmediate environmental change. And as I talk to people kind\nof throughout, you know, certainly throughout the economy,\npeople who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which\nis just this last 10 years of misery is just over. I mean, the one that I'm\nwatching that's really funny. I mean, Facebook's getting a lot, Meta's getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is\nBlackRock, which I'm not, you know, and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so, you know, the Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock was like first in as a major, you know, investment CEO on like\nevery dumb social trend and rule set, like every... All right, I'm going for it.\nEvery retardant, (laughs) every retarded thing you can imagine.\n- Yeah. - Every ESG and every, like, every possible saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed\nideological positions. And, you know, he was coming\nin, he literally was like, had a aggregated together\ntrillions of dollars of shareholdings that he did not, you know, that were his customer's rights. And he, you know, seized\ntheir voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been like backpedaling\nfrom that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example, last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, you know, he pulled out\nof the crazy energy stuff. And so, like, you know, he's\nbacking away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard\nPryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where\nhe could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (Lex laughing) (laughs) And so, you know,\neven there doing that, and just the whole thing, I mean this, I dunno if you saw the court\nrecently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of\ndirectors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel\nand I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional\nattorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight\nface that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who\nliterally wrote a book called \"The Diversity Myth.\"\n- Yeah. - And he literally looked\nlike he'd swallowed a live goldfish and that-\n- Yeah. - And this was imposed, I mean, this was like so\nincredibly offensive to him that like, it was just\nabsolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (Lex laughing) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange\nimposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that, you know, so like these things basically are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other\nside of it is basically, you know, finally being able\nto get back to, you know, everything that, you know,\neverybody always wanted to do, which is like, run their\ncompanies, have great products, have happy customers,\nyou know, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society. - It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. - Well, so it was very, you\nknow, there was a moment. So you know, Peter, of course, you know, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but you know, there are other\nmen on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it,\nand we're like, all right, like, okay, LGBT, and we keep\ncoming back to the B, right? And it's like- (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - You know, it's like-\n- All right. - You know, I'm willing to do\na lot for this company, but- (both laughing) - It's all about sacrifice for diversity. - Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay,\nlike is there a test? - Right.\n- Right. You know, so.\n(Lex laughing) - Oh, yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? - [Marc] The questions\nthat got asked, you know. - What are you willing to do-\n- Yeah, and- - The greater good? - I've become very good at asking lawyers\ncompletely absurd questions with a totally straight face. - And do they answer with a\nstraight face, like lawyers- - Sometimes.\n- Okay. - I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. - So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon\nValley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to\npreference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? Like what percent of them\nare feeling this vibe shift and are interested in\ncreating the roaring '20s in the way they've described? - So first, we should\nmaybe talk population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley and the way to just measure that is just look at\nvoting records, right? And what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically, my entire time there has\nbeen overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that\nis political donation records. And again, you know,\nthe political donations in the Valley, you know,\nrange from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. And so, you know, I just\nbring it up 'cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there\nis a very big question of what's happening in\nLos Angeles right now. I don't wanna get into the fire, but like, it's catastrophic. And, you know, there was\nalready a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people\nin LA are really thinking about things right now as\nthey're trying to, you know, literally save their houses\nand save their families. But, you know, even in San Francisco, you know, there was a big shift\nto the right in the voting in '24. So, we'll see where\nthat goes, but you know, you observe that by just looking\nat the numbers over time. The part that I'm more\nfocused on is, you know, and I don't know how to\nexactly describe this, but it's like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people, right? You know, and I don't have a list, but like, you know, it's\nall the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top\nengineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, you know, the people who kind of\nbuilt and run the companies. And they're, you know,\nI don't have numbers, but I have a much more\ntactile feel, you know, for what's happening. So the big thing I have\nnow come to believe is that the idea that people\nhave beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most\nhigh-status people just go along. And I think maybe the\nmost high-status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the\nmost focused on status. And the way I would\ndescribe that is, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the\nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely\ninteresting articulation. You know, he was an\ninsane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. (both laughing) But-\n- Shots fired, man. - But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing\nwhere he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that's just stuck in my\nmind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept, you just called over-socialization. And so, you know, most\npeople are socialized, like most people are, you\nknow, we live in a society, most people learn how\nto be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There's something about\nmodern Western elites where they're over-socialized and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, you know, think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little\nbit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence\nof where I grew up. Like even before I had the\nviews that I have today, there was always just this\nweird thing where it's like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree\non every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in The New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? (laughs) Right? But why does everybody like\nsnap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I\ncame to Silicon Valley, and it's just as true\ntoday 30 years later. And so I think most\npeople are just literally, I think they're taking their cues from, it's some combination of\nthe press, the universities, the big foundations. So basically, it's like\nThe New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and you know, I don't\nknow, you know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and you know, maybe the President if\nyour party is in power. And like, whatever that is, everybody who's sort of\ngood and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the\ntwo interesting things about that is, number one, there's no divergence among\nthe organs of power, right? So Harvard and Yale believed\nthe exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believed the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and\nthe Rockefeller Foundation believed the exact same thing. Google, and, you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believed the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there's never conflict\nin the moment, right? And so, you know, The New York Times and The Washington Post\nagreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the\nspecifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically, we in the valley, we're\non the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood's\non the tail end of that, in the same way New York's\non the tail end of that, the same way the media's\non the tail end of that. It's like some sort of\ncollective hive mind thing. And I just go through that to say like, I don't think most people in my orbit, or you know, let's say the top\n10,000 people in the Valley, or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're sitting\nthere thinking basically, I have rocks... I mean, they probably think\nthey have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core\nof rocks solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch\nreality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they\nconform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time, they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd. - Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that, there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking to\npeople really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens\nat the dinner parties? Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four\npeople who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the\nmind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention\nwithin New York Times with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that\novertook Marc Andreessen's face. - So look, I'll just\ntell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences,\nno, there's none of that. What there is that all of the\nheretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation is either\ndiscussed a one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real-life social network. There's a secret handshake,\nwhich is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like\nknow each other a little bit, but like not well. And like you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to\nthe other person openly or whether you have to\nlike be fully conformist. It's a joke. - Well, yeah, humor- - [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke.\n- Yep. - If the other person laughs,\nthe conversation is on. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - If the other person doesn't laugh, back slowly away from the scene, (laughs) I didn't mean anything by it. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then by the way, it\ndoesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke\nthat's just up against the edge of one of the, use the\nSam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. You know, it has to be up\nagainst one of the things, you know, one of the things\nthat you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point,\nwhat happens is you have a peer-to-peer network, right? You have a one-to-one\nconnection with somebody, and then you have your own, your little conspiracy\nof a thought criminality, and then you've probably\nbeen through this, you have your network\nof thought criminals, and then they have their\nnetwork of thought criminals, and then you have this\nlike delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together, right? - And the fundamental mechanism\nof the dance is humor. - Yeah, it's humor like it, right? Well, of course.\n- Memes. Yeah. - Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor's a way\nto have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss\nserious thing without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right? So that's part of it, which is one of the reasons\nwhy comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can't. 'Cause, you know, they\ncan always fall back on, oh, yeah, I was just going for the laugh.\n- Yeah. - But the other key\nthing about humor, right? Is that laughter's involuntary, right? Like, you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision whether you're gonna laugh. And everybody can tell when\nsomebody's fake laughing, right? And this, every professional\ncomedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something truthful. Like, people don't laugh at\nlike, made-up bullshit stories. They laugh 'cause like\nyou're revealing something that they either have not\nbeen allowed to think about or have not been allowed\nto talk about, right? Or is off limits. And all of a sudden,\nit's like the ice breaks and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny and like I laugh, and then, of course,\nthis is why, of course, live comedy is so powerful is 'cause you're all doing\nthat at the same time, so you start to have, you\nknow, the safety of numbers. And so the comedians have like the all, it's no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has\nbeen as successful as he has 'cause they have this\nhack that the, you know, the rest of us who are\nnot professional comedians don't have, but you have\nyour in-person version of it. Yeah, and then you've got the question of whether you can sort of\njoin the networks together. And then you've probably\nbeen to this is, you know, then at some point\nthere's like a different, there's like the alt dinner party, the (indistinct) dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are like the happiest\nmoments of everybody's lives, 'cause they're just like,\neverybody's just ecstatic, 'cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed, like for every third sentence that comes outta my mouth, and we can actually\ntalk about real things. So that's the live version of it. And then, of course, the other\nside of it's the, you know, the group chat phenomenon, right? And then basically the same\nthing played out, you know, until Elon bought X and until\nSubstack took off, you know, which were really the\ntwo big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute\nconformity on the social networks, like literally enforced by\nthe social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through\ncancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming, right? But then group chats grew\nup to be the equivalent of samizdat, right? Anybody who grew up in the\nSoviet Union under, you know, communism, note, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It is like, how do you\nknow who you could talk to? And then how do you\ndistribute information? And like, you know, again, that was the hard\nauthoritarian version of this. And then we've been living\nthrough this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, with\nsome of the same patterns. - And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient\nto build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. - Yeah, exactly. Well,\nand this is the thing, and well, this is kind of the running joke about groups, right? The running kind of\nthing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, every group chat, if you've noticed this like, this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up\nbeing about memes and humor. And the game of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable. - [Lex] Yeah. - As you can get without\nactually tripping it, right? And like literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest\nwhere, but it's walking, they walk right up the line\nand they're constantly testing. And every once in a while\nsomebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, \"Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, we gotta wait until\nnext year to talk about that.\" You know, they walk it back. And so it's that same thing, and yeah. And then group chats is a\ntechnological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. 'Cause basically, it was number one, it was, you know, obviously\nthe rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of\nthe new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination\nof WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is\nthose were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough, I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably\nfour or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages,\nI think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of the\ndisappearing messages, right? And so it's like, you know, I\noften get behind on my thing, so I set to seven-day, you\nknow, disappearing messages and my friends who, you know, are like, no, that's way too much risk. - Yeah.\n- It's gotta be a day. And then every once in a\nwhile somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something\nlike particularly inflammatory. - Yeah, 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that\nbothers me about WhatsApp, the choices between 24 hours\nand, you know, seven days, one day or seven days.\n- (laughs) Right. - And I have to have an existential crisis about deciding.\n- Yes. - Whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Now, of course,\nwhat's happening right now is the big thaw, right? And so the vibe shift. So what's happening on the\nother side of the election is, you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the\ncontinued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new\nplatforms that are emerging. You know, like I think\nit may be, you know, I don't know that everything\njust shifts back into public, but like a tremendous amount\nof the verboten conversations, you know, can now shifts\nback into public view. And I mean, quite frankly,\nthis is one of those things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those, you know, what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like\nnet better for society that those things happen in\npublic instead of private. You know, do you really want, like, yeah. Like does she wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it's just, look, it's just I think,\nclearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. - I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea\nthat we're talking about. I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction\nof people have that? To me, the preference falsification\nis really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? 'Cause like that the dynamical system that is the difference between\nthose two is fascinating. Like, throughout history, the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting, 'cause everybody was following, you know, the line until not.\n- Right. - But for sure, privately,\nthere was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where like this is the\nbureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really\nbothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden, there's a trigger that allows\nthe vibe shift to happen. To me, like the interesting\nquestion here is, what is the landscape of\nprivate thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how\nmuch dormant energy is there for this roaring '20s? What people are like, no more\nbullshit, let's get shit done. - Yeah, so we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- - [Lex] Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly, this is one\nof the all-time great books. Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book, but it's completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply\nhistorically informed. So it's called \"Private\nTruths, Public Lies.\" And it's written by a social science\nprofessor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his\na definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls preference falsification. And so preference\nfalsification is two things, preference falsification... And you get it from the title of the book, \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So preference falsification\nis when you believe something and you can't say it, or/and this is very important,\nyou don't believe something and you must say it, right? And the commonality there is\nin both cases, you're lying. You believe something internally, and then you're lying about it in public. And so the thing, you know, and there's sort of the\ntwo classic forms of it. There's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe\ncommunism is rotten, but I can't say it version of it. But then there's also the famous parable of the real-life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good\nbook on this topic, which is \"The Power of the Powerless,\" you know, who is an\nanti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the, you know, the president Czechoslovakia\nafter the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book, and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of\nthe world unite, right? And so he describes what he calls the parable of the greengrocer, which is your greengrocer\nin Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been... 50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your story that says, \"Workers of\nthe world, unite,\" right? And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear\nthat the workers of the world are not going to unite. (laughs) Like of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been\nat that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be\nin your window every morning, because if it's not in\nyour window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are gonna come by and they're gonna get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays\nin the window all day long. But he says, the thing\nis, every single person, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the slogan knows that it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the store knows that the greengrocer is\nonly putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to\ngo through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the\nsystem and lying in public. And so it turns into\ndemoralization campaign. In fact, it's not ideological\nenforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake, everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're\nenforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they are\nenforcing compliance, right? And compliance with the regime. And fuck you, you will comply, right? And so anyway, that's\nthe other side of that. And of course, we have\nlived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening\nto this could name a series of slogans that\nwe've all been forced to chant for the last decade, that everybody knows at\nthis point are just like, simply not true. I'll let the audience, you know, speculate on their own group chats. (both laughing) - Send Marc your memes\nonline as well, please. - Yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so anyway, so it's the\ntwo sides of that, right? So it's \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending\nthat from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire\nsociety experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages\nquestion, which is like, okay, what happens in a society\nin which people are forced to lie in public about\nwhat they truly believe? What happens number one\nis that individually they're lying in public, and that's bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have\nan accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how\nmany people agree with them. And this is how you, and\nagain, this literally is like how you get something\nlike the communist system, which is like, okay, you\nend up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be\nwilling to go along with it, but I'm not gonna be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the people who agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a\nmovement, you're gonna get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're gonna win the revolution, right? And so the question of like\nwhat the percentage actually is like a really critical question. And then, basically, in any\nsort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know\nuntil you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put at\nthe test in the same way. This is exactly what's happened\nfor the last two years, like 100% of exactly what's happened. It's like straight outta this book, which is somebody, Elon,\nsticks his hand up (laughs) and says, \"The workers of the\nworld are not going to unite.\" - Yeah.\n- Right. Or the emperor is actually\nwearing no clothes, right? You know that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is\nstanding there by themselves, and everybody else in\nthe audience is like, \"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna\nhappen to that guy,\" right? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn't know, the\nfirst guy doesn't know, other people don't know, like,\nwhich way is this gonna go? And it may be that's a minority position and that's the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that's a majority position and you are now the\nleader of a revolution. And then basically, of\ncourse, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that\ndoesn't get killed, (laughs) the second guy does... Well, a lot of the time\nthat guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn't get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing, all right? Now, you've got two. Two leads to four, four leads\nto eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia\nand Eastern Europe in '89, when it goes, it can go, right? And then it rips. And then what happens\nis very, very quickly, if it turns out that you\nhad a large percentage of the population that actually believed\nthe different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, \"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority.\" And at that point, like you\nwere on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. Right, now. The other part of this is the distinction between the role of the\nelites and the masses. And here the best book is called \"The True Believer,\" which\nis the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this 'cause the elites do idea\nformation and communication. But the elites, by definition\nare a small minority. And so there's also this giant\nrole played by the masses, and the masses are not\nnecessarily thinking these things through in the same\nintellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure\nexperiencing these things in their daily lives,\nand they for sure have at least very strong\nemotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the\nelites lined up with, or either the current elites change or a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually\na different better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the, you know, to\nfollow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is\nalso happening right now. And again, case study\none of that would be Elon and you know, who turns out, you know, in truly massive following. - And he has done that over and over in different industries, not\njust saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit\nin the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. - Yeah. And it's like, well,\nbut then there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, and this is where, you know, there are many specific\nthings about Elon's genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit,\nbut in his mind it's true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else. He's not right all the time. But at least my through\nline with him both in what he says in public and\nwhat he says in private, which by the way are\nthe exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about\nwhat he believes in private, or at least he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's 100% consistent\nin my experience. By the way, there's two guys who are 100% consistent like that I know. Elon and Trump. (both laughing) - Yeah.\n- Whatever you think of them. - [Lex] Yeah. - What they say in\nprivate is 100% identical to what they say in public. Like, they're completely transparent, they're completely honest\nin that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful\nleaders of these movements, 'cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost\neveryone else actually believes, but nobody was actually\nwilling to say out loud. And so they can actually\ncatalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this\nframework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party, as I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind\nof conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one\nwho was saying them. And so the again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes, like we're\ngoing this other direction. That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual\nmechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me\nthat we have been living through exactly this. We've been living through\neverything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav\nHavel described, (laughs) you know, Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've been living\nthrough the, you know, the true believer elites\nmasses, you know, thing with, you know, with a set of like\nbasically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the loyalty masses anymore, and a set of new elites that\nare running away with things. And so like, we're living through this like\nincredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a\nmoral of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really\nbad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they\nhave to do, you know, to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. - So one of the ways to avoid\nthat in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between\nwhat's said in private and what's said in public small. - Yeah. It's like, well, this\nis sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep\npeople from saying things, which means we can keep\npeople from thinking things. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know, by the way, that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean,\nagain, the hard form, you know, Soviet Union\nowning a mimeograph, pre-photocopiers, there\nwere mimeograph machines that were used to make samizdat\nand underground newspapers, which is the mechanism\nof written communication of radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death, right? So that's the hard version, right? You know, the soft version\nis somebody clicks a button in Washington and you are\nerased from the internet, right? Like, which, you know, good\nnews, you're still alive. Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your\nfamily now, you know, they hates you and won't\ntalk to you, but you know, you know, whatever the version\nof cancellation has been. And so like, does that work? Like maybe it works for a while, like it worked for the\nSoviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially\nwhen it was coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like\nincredible speed and ferocity. 'Cause to your point, there's\nall this bottled up energy. Now, your question was like,\nwhat are the percentages? Like what's the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. It's like you've got 20%, like true believers in\nwhatever is, you know, the current thing, you know, you got 20% of people who are just like\ntrue believers of whatever they, you know, whatever's\nin the new, like I say, whatever's in The New York\nTimes, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation,\nlike they're just believe. And by the way, maybe\nit's 10, maybe it's five, but let's say generously it's 20. So you know, 20% kind of\nfull-on revolutionaries. And then you've got, let's\ncall it 20% on the other side that are like, \"No, I'm\nnot on board with this. This is crazy. I'm not signing up for this.\" But, you know, they view themselves as they're in a small minority, and in fact, they start\nout in a small minority, 'cause what happens is the\n60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people. And it's not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying\nto go to work each day and do a good job and be a good\nperson and raise their kids and, you know, have a little\nbit of time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, political activism or any of this stuff. It's just not their thing. But that's where the over\nsocialization comes in, it's just like, okay, by\ndefault, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the\nradical revolutionaries, at least for a while. And then the counter elite\nis in this other 20%. And over time, they build\nup a theory and network and ability to resist and a\nnew set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's\na contest and then, right? And then the question is,\nwhat happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kinda my point, it's not even really does\nthe 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like,\nokay, what is the thing that 60% now decides to\nbasically fall into step with? And I think that, in the valley, that 60% for the last\ndecade decided to be woke and, you know, extremely, I would say, (laughs) on\nedge on a lot of things. And you know, that 60%\nis pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it. - And I would love to\nsee where that pivot goes 'cause there's internal battles\nhappening right now, right? - So this is the other thing, okay, so there's two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is, he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you're gonna have\nis you're now gonna have people in the other direction. You're\ngonna have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't, (laughs) right?\n- Right. - So it's gonna swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's\nnot the only part of this, but you know, he's just a\nconvenient shorthand for, you know, for a lot of this. But, you know, whatever it is, you'll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, right? Or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled\nthat person, right? Where of course, they were\nfull on a part of the mob, like, you know, kind of at\nthat moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference\nfalsification happening in the other direction. And his prediction, I think,\nbasically is you'll end up with the same quote,\n\"problem\" on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. You know, how far is American\nsociety willing to go on any of these things? I don't know. But like, there is some question there. And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this, you\nknow, elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those\npeople are still in power and they're in very, you\nknow, important positions. And The New York Times is\nstill The New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard. And like, those people haven't\nchanged like at all, right? And bureaucrats in the governments and, you know, senior democratic, you know, politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there, you know, right now feeling like reality\nhas just smacked them hard in the face 'cause they\nlost the election so badly. But they're now going into a, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War, right? And that form of the Civil\nWar is completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize\n'cause we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half\nof them are saying, \"No, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak, we were too soft. You know, we must become\nmore revolutionary. We must double down and we\nmust, you know, celebrate, you know, murders in the street of health insurance executives.\" And that right now is like a real fight. - If I could tell you\na little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a\nhistorian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking\nabout having a podcast, on doing a podcast. And he eventually said that,\n\"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I\njust don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are\nthe particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would\nsurprise a lot of people if I said who it is. You know, this is a\nperson who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80-plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Okay? Nevertheless, he just\ndoesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just\nhave a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk\nto your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are\nfeeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts,\nhow quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you\nmentioned 20, 60, 20 matters and the contents of the\nprivate groups matters, and the dynamics of how\nthat shifts matters. 'Cause it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. There's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these\nnew vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold. - Yeah. So he's a friend of yours, I respect that you don't wanna name him. I also respect you\ndon't wanna beat on him, so I would like to beat\non him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? - Yes. He should use it. - So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate\nindictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart\nof our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it's, by the way, it's\nlike across the board, it's like all the top universities. It's like, 'cause the\nsiren song for right? What it's been for 70 years,\nwhatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure\nsystem, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an\nacademic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what\nyou actually think, right? Then you can do your\nwork and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these\npeople have done to it. Like it's gone, like that entire thing was\nfake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely, completely giving up the\nentire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually\n100% by taxpayer money. - What's the inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this,\nwhat can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? - That the population at large is gonna realize the\ncorruption in their industry and it's going to withdraw the funding? - (laughs) It's okay. So desperation. (laughs)\n- No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next.\nOkay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources\nof federal funding. The big one is a federal\nstudent loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of\ndollars at this point. And then only spiraling, you know, way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know\nthat when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as\nmuch as 70% of the money for central uses. - [Lex] Yeah. - Number three is tax exemption\nat the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit\ninstitutions as opposed to, let's say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close\nto a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources\nof federal taxpayer money, and then for the state\nschools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild, 'cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at University of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed\nand I'm cheering for them, but the problem is, you're now inserting. Suppose you and I wanna\nstart a new university and we wanna hire all the\nfree thinking professors, and we wanna have the\nplace that fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. I'll give you the most direct reason, we can't get access to that money, we can't get access to\nfederal student funding. Do you know how\nuniversities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They're not accredited by\nthe Department of Education. Instead, what happens is, the Department of Education\naccredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that\ndo the accreditation. Guess what the composition of\nthe accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to\nfederal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic\nthey are about accrediting a new university? Right, and so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone... I mean, it's just obvious now. It's just gone like sideways in basically any possible\nway it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting beaten\nup on campus for being, you know, the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every\npossible way at this point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these\nthings without replacing them. And there's no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's\nlike everything in life. I mean, in a sense, this is\nlike the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when\na company does a bad job, is they go bankrupt and another company\ntakes its place, right? And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that\nis what happens is this is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? 'Cause things are tested and tried, and then you, you know, the things that are good survive. And so these places\nhave cut themselves off. They've been allowed to cut\nthemselves off from both, from evolution at the institutional level and evolution of the\nindividual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable\nin their current form. - I disagree with you on that. Maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can\nrevolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford\nand MIT are important. - Oh, but that logic\ndoesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. - Underpants gnome, can you\nexplain what that means? - Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started\nwatching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is \"South Park.\" - Yes.\n- And there is- - Wow. - And there is a, which by the way is a little\naggressive for a nine-year-old. - Very aggressive. - But he likes it. So he's learning all kinds of new words. - And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. - I told him, I said, \"You're\ngonna hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\" - Right. (laughs) Education. - And I said, \"You know\nhow we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I said, \"Not using a word that you learn in here\ndoes not count as lying.\" - [Lex] Wow.\n- \"And keep that in mind.\" - This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. - And of course, in the\nvery opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls\nthe other kid a dildo. Right, we're off to the races. - Yep. Let's go. - \"Daddy, what's a dildo?\" - [Lex] Yep. (both laughing) - So, you know, \"Sorry son, I don't know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So the-\n- Underpants gnome. - So famous episode of \"South\nPark,\" the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat... All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing the underpants. And it's just like, well,\nwho on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it's\nthe underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants\ngnomes that come to town and they've got this\nlittle underground warrant of tunnels in storage places\nfor all the underpants. And so they go out at night,\nthey steal the underpants, and the kids discover that, you\nknow, the underpants gnomes, and they're, you know,\n\"What are you doing? Like what's the point of this?\" And so the underpants gnomes\npresent their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit.\n- Yeah. - [Marc] Step two, question mark. (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So you just proposed the underpants gnome-\n- Yeah. - Which is very common in politics. Oh, so the form of this in politics is we must do something.\n- Yeah. - This is something,\ntherefore we must do this. But there's no causal logic chain in there at all to expect\nthat's actually gonna succeed 'cause there's no reason to believe that it is.\n- Yeah, but- - And it's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the\nhost of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I hear this, I have friends\nwho are on these boards, right?\n- Yeah. - Very involved in these places, and I hear this all the\ntime, which is like, \"Oh, these are very important. We must fix them.\" And so therefore, they're fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. - If there's that pressure\nthat you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty primary, fire a lot of the administration and realign and reinvigorate\nthis idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't... Because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is\naligned with this very idea that you're talking about. It's this meaning like\nintellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface it's aligned, underneath it's become corrupted. - If we say free speech and\nacademic freedom, often enough, sooner or later, these tenured\nprofessors will get brave. - Wait, do you think the universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions\nfor educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit\nthat's outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create\ninstitution like that? - How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? - Right. You invent something new? - You open a new restaurant. - Yeah. - Like how often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that's just absolutely horrible, and it's poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you\ngo back and it's fantastic? Charlie Munger actually\nhad the best comment on, this great investor, Charlie Munger, has great comment. He was once asked, he's like,\nyou know, his, you know, General Electric was going\nthrough all these challenges and he was asked to do Q&A. It said, \"How would you fix the culture at General Electric?\" And he said, \"Fix the\nculture at General Electric?\" He said, \"I couldn't even fix\nthe culture at a restaurant.\" (Lex laughing) Like, it's insane. Like obviously you can't do it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nobody in business\nthinks you can do that. Like, it's impossible. Like it's not, now look, having said all that, I\nshould also express this 'cause I have a lot of friends\nwho work at these places and are involved in various\nattempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong, I\nwould love to be wrong. I would love for the\nunderpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how\nto do. I would love to fix it, I'd love to see them come back\nto their spoken principles, I think that'd be great. I'd love to see the professors\nwith tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I\nmean, it would be fantastic. You know, my partner and I have done like a lot of\npublic speaking on this topic, it's been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay,\nlike these challenges have to be confronted directly. By the way, let me also\nsay something positive. You know, especially post-October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart\npeople who are major donors and board members of these\ninstitutions like Marc Rowan, you know, who are really\ncoming in trying to, you know, I think legitimately\ntrying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He's working overtime to try to do this. Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question\nwould just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? - I'm a person that\nbelieves in leadership. If you have the right leadership- - [Marc] Right. - The whole system can be changed. - So here's a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? - You know how I think runs it? - [Marc] Yeah. - Whoever the fuck says they run it, that's what great leadership is. Like a president has that power.\n- But how does- - President of university has the leverage 'cause they can mouth off like Elon can. - Can they fire the professors? - They can fire them through\nbeing vocal publicly, yes. - Can they fire the professors? - What are you talking about legally? - [Marc] Can they fire- - No, they cannot fire the professors. - Then we know who runs the university. - The professors? - Yeah, professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they're, of course, in a radicalization\nfeedback cycle driving- - You said feral students?\n- The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows\nis that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them\nbecause they cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same\nthing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They cannot outlast you. I mean it's the whole thing\nthat, it's the resistance. Like they can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. - That's definitely a crisis\nthat needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that\nI'm defending academia here. I agree with you that\nthe situation is dire but I just think that\ninstitutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been\ngrilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation\nyou said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's- - I didn't say Dairy Queen\nis a great restaurant. - Let the listener take- - I said Dairy Queen\nis the best restaurant. - The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc\nAndreessen is saying today- - I don't wanna-\n- Put that into cont- - You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard.\n- Yeah. - They can get like\n4,000 calories in a cup. - They can and they're delicious. - [Marc] It's amazing. - They're truly delicious-\n- They're really fantastic. And they'll put anything in there you want.\n- All right- - Okay, so, but anyway, lemme just close by saying, look, my friends at the university\nsystem, I would just say, \"Look like, this is the challenge.\" Like I would just pose\nthis as the challenge. Like to me, like this is, having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation\nthat actually has to happen. This is the bar that\nactually has to be hit. These problems need to\nbe confronted directly, 'cause I think there's been way too much, I mean, I'm actually worried\nkinda on the other side, there's too much happy talk\nin these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers\ncome to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is\ngoing through, you know, no fault of any of ours,\nbut like the fuse is going and there's some window of time here to fix this and address\nit and justify the money 'cause it just, normal taxpayers sitting in\nnormal towns in normal jobs are not gonna tolerate\nthis for that much longer. - You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep\ninto the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to\nspeak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were\nthere when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of\ncensorship on social media. So take me to, through\nthat history, if you can, the use of censorship. - So I was there on the\nground floor in 1993. (both laughing) - There's multiple floors to\nthis building, apparently. - There are.\n- (laughs) Yeah. - So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. - That is fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. Actually, 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. - Did you have the courage to\nspeak up back then? (laughs) - I did not have any problems\nspeaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, you know, I\nwas legitimate, you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research\nproject actually funded by the federal government\nat a public university. So, you know, I don't\nthink my boss was like in any way outta line,\nbut it was like, yeah, like this web browser thing is great, but like could it just make\nsure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for\na second, as a technologist, I had a issue, which is this\nwas like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm (laughs) that I was going to have to design. And then apparently a variety of other, apparently body parts people are also sensitive about.\n- Yeah. - And then I politely declined to do this. - For just the technical\ndifficulties of it. - Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm a, you know,\nI'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days the internet\ngenerally was, you know, a free-fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting\nas sort of pre-'93, the internet was such a\nspecific niche community. Like, it was like the million\nkind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually like\ndidn't really have a lot of, you know, issues that people\nwere like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn't\nwanna start the process. So I think the way to think\nabout this, so first of all, you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I've been involved with\nthis at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007, so I've seen everything\nin the last, you know, almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I've been involved in most of the other companies over time, so I was an angel investor in Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover\nof Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we\nwere the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk\nspecifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you\nlike the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah, so basically the\nway to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that\ncan have zero censorship. And by the way, that also\nmirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited\nfree speech either. The US First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from\nthe Supreme Court over time. You know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're not\ncovered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are gonna\nstart an internet company and have a service, we can't\nhave that stuff either, right? 'Cause it's illegal or\nit will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always gonna\nhave a censorship engine. I mean, hopefully, it's not\nactually in the browser, but like you're gonna have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now\nyou have a machine right now. Now you have a system where\nyou can put in rules saying, we allow this, we don't allow that. You have enforcement, you\nhave consequences, right? And once that system is in place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now\nanybody in that company or anybody associated with that company, or anybody who wants to\npressure that company will just start to say, \"Okay,\nyou should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\" And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like\nvery, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided\nwith the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. You know, it's the kids that\nwere in school between like, you know, for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and like, they came out\nlike super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started\nmounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that\nthese companies were, you know, very subject to being controlled and the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors\nwere almost all Democrats and, you know, there's\ntremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from\nthe first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people\nand other, you know, law enforcement\nintelligence people came in and worked, and you know, they were all Democrats for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they, you know, picked it up and put it\non, and then they just ran. And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech\nconversation started exactly like you'd expect, which is,\nwe can't have the N-word. And which the answer is fair enough, let's not have the N-word. Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right? And Jordan Peterson has\ntalked a lot about this. The definition of hate\nspeech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, right? So we can't have things that make, you know, people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like me that are\ndisagreeable raise their hands and say, \"Well, that idea right there\nmakes me uncomfortable.\" But of course, that doesn't\ncount as hate speech, right? So, you know, the ring\nof power is on one hand and not on the other hand. And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently like\ncompletely anodyne comments that are completely\nlegitimate on television or on the Senate floor all\nof a sudden our hate speech can't be said online. So that, you know, the\nring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the\nstuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little\nbit of that early on, but of course, that really\nkicked in with Trump. So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by like three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence\nof the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you\nknow, a ring of power that was even more powerful, right? Because, you know, hate\nspeech, it's like, okay, at some point, if\nsomething offensive or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with\nmisinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, what do we know for 800 years or whatever Western civilization, it's that, you know,\nthere's only a few entities that can determine the\ntruth on every topic. You know, there's God, you\nknow, there's the king. We don't have those anymore and the rest of us are\nall imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any\ngroup of experts is gonna sit around the table and decide\non the truth is, you know, deeply anti-Western and\ndeeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation\nkind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax\ninto just full-blown, we're gonna use that weapon\nfor whatever we want. And then of course, then the\nculminating moment on that, that really was the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was we're gonna censor all theories that the COVID virus might\nhave been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies\nlike that was the point where people for the first\ntime, this is like what, three years ago for the\nfirst time they were like, and that was when it sunk in\nwhere it's just like, okay, this has spun completely outta control. But anyway, that's how\nwe got to where we are. And then basically that spell lasted that complex existed and\ngot expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and so when I am super\nproud of those guys, 'cause they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were gonna be\na free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And, you know, they\ntried to just beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by\nthe way, from, you know, let's say certain of the\nplatform companies, you know, basically threatening them.\nAnd they stood up to it. And, you know, sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum\nof speech and conversation, you know, anywhere on planet Earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way, it's great. And then obviously Elon, you\nknow, with X was the, you know, the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. - And there's also like singular moments, I think you've spoken about\nthis, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. - [Marc] Yes. - There's certain moments that just kinda shake\neverybody up, the right person, the right time, just it's a wake-up call. - So that there, and\nI will tell you, like, and I should say Jon Stewart\nattacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him, but I would say, I would say\nlong run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of \"The Daily Show\" when he was on it, you know, for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance\non the Colbert Show. And I don't know how\nbroadly this is, you know, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don't know how,\nif people remember this, but I will tell you in the\nrooms where people discuss what his misinformation and these policies, that\nwas a very big moment. That was probably actually\nthe key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I\nwould say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who\ndon't recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, like, you know, you absolutely\nmust lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep\nall the schools closed. You absolutely must have\neverybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a\nmask like the whole thing. And then one of those was,\nyou absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you're a fascist\nNazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person, right? And that was like uniform\nand that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don't know if\nthey planned it or not, 'cause Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much of it was a bit, but he went on there and\nhe just had one of these, like the Emperor's wearing no\nclosed things where he said, \"It's just not plausible that you had the COVID\nsuper virus appear 300 yards down the street from the\nWuhan Institute (laughs) of lethal coronaviruses.\" Like, it's just not plausible that certainly that you\ncould just rule that out. And then there was another\nkey moment, actually, the more serious version\nwas I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big\npiece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is like\none of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been like\nalt, you know, renegade, there had been, you know, people\nrunning around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was\nlike in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember let's say a board meeting at one of these companies after that, where basically, you know, everybody looked around\nthe table and was like, \"All right, like, I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore.\" And, you know, and then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \"Well, wait a minute, why were we censoring\nthat in the first place?\" And okay, like, and then, you know, the\ndownstream, not that day, but the downstream\nconversations were like, \"Okay, if we made such\na giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective\nmistake censoring that, then what does that say about\nthe rest of our regime?\" And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. - I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made\nwas a courageous act. - [Marc] Yeah, I agree. - I think we need to have\nmore of that in the world. And like you said, Elon,\neverything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg\ndid on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? - He has become, I think, an outstanding\ncommunicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for\na lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he's, you know,\nhe's one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And you know, as you do\nwith all of your episodes, like when somebody sit\nand talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody 'cause it's really hard to\nbe artificial for that long. And, you know, he's now\ndone that repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then, look, again, I would maybe put him in\nthe third category now with, certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put\nhim up there now with, you know, kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that. Like he said on that show\nwhat he really believes, he said all the same things\nthat he says in private. Like, I don't think there's\nreally any discrepancy anymore. I would say he has\nalways taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running\na company the size of Meta and to running services\nthat are that large. And I think, you know, his\nconception of what he's doing, which I think is correct,\nis he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. And then, you know, the\ncompany has, you know, many tens of thousands of\nemployees and many investors, and it's a public company,\nand he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so, you know, he has\nnot felt like he has had, let's just say, the complete\nflexibility that Elon has had. And, you know, people could\nargue that one way or the other, but, you know, he talked about a lot. He's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm gonna put\nmyself right back up there. Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this.\nLike, I've also learned a lot. Like, my views on things\nare very different than they were 10 years\nago on lots of topics. And so, you know, I've\nbeen on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as, or better\nthan anybody else I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show\nabout something very important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a set of decisions\nthat you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and\nso forth and it's valid, but you are under tremendous\nexternal pressure as well. And by the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've got your executives\nin some cases coming at you. You've got your board in\nsome cases coming at you. You've got your\nshareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire\nnonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you and, you know, that's\nthe really, you know, stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation\nof the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, then again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they\nclearly didn't wanna do and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I say, like I've known every CEO of Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the\njob, it was just daily beatings. Like it just getting punched in the face every single day, constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting (laughs) physically\npunched in the face, and then-\n- Getting better and better. Yeah. - You know, and he's very good\nat, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people\nto have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate\nwith like, I would say, extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in\nhis job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a\nlot about him that he has, you know, risen to this\noccasion the way that he has. And by the way, I should\nalso say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, you know, legitimate\nthing for people to say, but you know, it's like, \"Oh, you're only doing\nthis because of Trump, or, you know, whatever.\" And it's just like, no, like\nhe has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them\nout for a very long time. And so I think what\nyou saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the moment thing that could change at any time. - So what do you think it's like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal\npressure and external pressure? What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? - That's a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like, it's not a thing, right? And again, legitimately so, like CEOs get paid a lot,\nlike the whole thing. There's a lot of great things about it. So it's not like they\nshould be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that\nthey are human beings. And it is the case that\nit is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job is because your words\ncarry tremendous weight and you are dealing with\nextremely complicated issues, and you're under a tremendous\namount of emotional, you know, personal, emotional stress. And, you know, you often end\nup not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like, keep up an exercise routine\nand all those things. And you know, you come under family stress 'cause you're working all the time. Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO of our last company before\nwe started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life\nwas even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was like supposed\nto be like having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you get that a lot. But the key thing is like, you\ncan't talk to people, right? So I mean, you could talk to\nyour spouse and your kids, but like, they don't understand that they're networking in your company. They don't understand, have\nthe context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And they can't resist. Like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily\nrely on what they say. It's very hard in most\ncompanies to talk to your board because they can fire you. Now, Mark has the situation\n'cause he has control, it actually turns out he\ncan talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about\nmany things that he does that most CEOs won't talk\nto their boards about because we literally,\nbecause we can't fire him. But a general, including\nall the CEOs of Twitter, that none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the board members, they're gonna fire you, you\ncan't talk to the shareholders 'cause they'll just like\ndump your stock, right? Like, okay, so every once in a while, what you find is basically the\nbest-case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a\nlittle bit outta that. But even that's fraught with peril 'cause can you really talk\nabout confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it's just a very\nlonely isolating thing to start with. And then on top of that,\nyou apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal, external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand\nmost forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. - Hmm.\n- Right. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external\npressure you can withstand, and by that I mean\ninvestors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative article,\nyou know, negative headline and you know, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many\nof those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot withstand\nis the internal crack. And what I always look for in high-pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the\ninternal team cracks. Because I know the minute that happens, we're in a different regime. (laughs) Like, it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid. Like we're in a different regime and like the whole thing\ncan unravel in the next week 'cause then people turn, I mean this, I guess this is what's happening\nin Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire\nchief turned on each other, and that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get\nput back together again. It is over, it is not\ngoing to work ever again. And that's what happens\nto inside companies. And so somebody like Mark is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's been very good at\nmaintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,\na lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing\nI'd say, as I said, that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And especially, although not\nall one is government pressure. Is that when your\ngovernment comes for you? Like yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out\nof them in short order. - Can you just linger on that 'cause it is maybe educating\nand deeply disturbing? You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again\nthis government pressure. So you think they've crossed a line into essentially criminal\nlevels of pressure? - Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs) but yes, absolute criminality. - Can you explain how\nthose possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? - So I just start with\nis a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good 'cause it needs\nto be in the public record. And so there's three forms of things that are in the public record\nthat people can look at. So when is the Twitter Files,\nright, which Elon put out with the set of journalists\nwhen he took over. And I will just tell\nyou, the Twitter Files are 100% representative of what I've seen at every\nother one of these companies. And so you can just see\nwhat happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies,\nyou know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind\nof pressure that they got. So that's number one. That's stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven't. The second is Mark referenced\nthis in the Rogan podcast. There's a congressman Jim Jordan, who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, you\nknow, whatever three years have done a full-scale\ninvestigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have\nnow been made public and you can download those reports. And there's like 2,000 pages\nworth of material on that. And that's essentially\nthe Facebook version of the Twitter Files just arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself\ntalking about this on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just\ndefer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is\nbasically the government, you know, over time and then\nculminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years, just decided that the First\nAmendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that\nfederal laws around free speech and around conspiracies\nto take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure. They just like literally\narbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, you know, threaten repercussions and force them to censor. And you know, there's\nthis whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment\nonly applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't\napply to companies. It's like, well, there's actually a little\nbit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely\napplies to the government. Like 100%, the First Amendment\napplies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship\nregime that was put in place. There was no due process\nput in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just\nlike flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. And then there are\nspecific federal statutes, it's 18 241 and 18 242. And one of them applies to federal employees,\ngovernment employees, and the other one\napplies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United\nStates Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional\nrights are enumerated, for example, in the First\nAmendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes\naway rights that you have, they don't need to be\nspecifically enumerated rights in the Constitution order\nto still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have\nthe rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right, and so de-banking\nqualifies as a right, you know, right to access to the financial system,\nis every bit something that's subject to these\nlaws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, which is we've talked\nabout two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we've talked about the companies. The government employees\nfor sure have misbehaved. The companies, there's a very\ninteresting question there as to whether they are victims\nor perpetrators or both. You know, they will defend\nand they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims,\nnot perpetrators, right? They're the downstream\nsubjects of pressure, you know, not the cause of pressure, but there's a big swath of\npeople who are in the middle and specifically the ones that\nare funded by the government that I think are in\npossibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of these\nthird-party censorship bureaus. I mean the one that is\nsort of is most obvious is the so-called Stanford\nInternet Observatory that got booted up there\nover the last several years. And they basically were funded\nby the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in\nthis very interesting spot where there could be, you know, very obvious theory under\nwhich they're basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they're\nalso very exposed on this and have behaved in just\nflagrantly illegal ways. - So fundamentally, government should not\ndo any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? - Can't. Not allowed. - It really is disturbing. I mean it probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the the old will to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection 'cause you can't put a check\non power for government, right? - There are so many ways\nthat they can get you, like there are so many ways\nthey can come at you and get you and, you know, the thing\nhere to think about is a lot of times when people\nthink about government action, they think about legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It's like this, you know, fancy little bill sneaked\nalong and goes this- - I'm just the bill. Yeah.\n- Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. Like that doesn't actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly\nwhat we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about\ngovernment power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the\nequivalent of legislation, but having not gone through\nthe legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that\nthe DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They're regulated and there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche\nyou'll hear a lot, which is, \"Oh, private companies can\ndo whatever they want.\" It's like, \"Oh, no, they can't.\" They're subject to tens of\nthousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes\ndown when you don't comply with regulations is profound. Like they can completely\nwreck your company with no ability for you\nto do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole\nprogram a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency\nfor payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were gonna\nbuild into every product, and they were gonna be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government\nand they went to the, all these different try to\nfigure out how to make it, so it's like fully compliant\nwith anti-money laundering and all these, you know,\ncontrols and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters\nto the big banks saying, \"We're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every\naspect of your business is going to come under\ngreatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\" which is, of course, the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner\nrestaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov\ncocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? And like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a law, it's\nnot even a regulation, it's just like straight\ndirect state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they're just like flat\nout telling you what to do, which is, of course,\nwhat a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. And so anyway, so what\nthese companies experienced was they experienced the\nfull panoply of this, but the level of intensity\nwas in that order, it was actually, legislation\nwas the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important and then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were\nultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people\nwho don't do it, right? So like as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, you have to decide. You don't wanna live in\nthat regime. I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people\non the right got very angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. You know, maybe some people on the left will now not want their, you know, Democratic nominees to\nbe so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written\nin the FT just now saying, we just need like broad\nafter what we've been through in the last decade, we need to broad base\ntruth and reconciliation, you know, efforts to really\nget to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like ultimately, we need\npeople to go to jail 'cause we need to set\nobject lessons that say that you don't get to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to\nthe new administration, and I don't wanna speak for them and I don't wanna predict\nwhat they're gonna do, but they for sure have\nthe ability to do both of those things and you know,\nwe'll see where they take it. - Yeah, it's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants\nthis kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people\nthat are participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's\nthat kind of protection. Nobody wants that. - So I use the metaphor, the ring of power.\n- Yeah. - And for people who\ndon't catch the reference, that's \"Lord of the Rings.\" And the thing with the Ring of Power and \"Lord of the Rings,\"\nit's the ring the Gollum has in the beginning and\nit turns you invisible. And it turns out it like unlocks all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically, the moral\nlesson of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which was, you know, written by a guy who thought very deeply\nabout these things is, yeah, the ring of power is\ninherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they're like, \"Gandalf, just put on the\nring and like fix this.\" Right, and he will not put the ring on even to like end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. And then, you know, as it starts, the character of Gollum is\nthe result of, you know, like a normal character\nwho ultimately becomes, you know, this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. And so, I mean, I think you said something\nactually quite profound there, which is the ring of power\nis infinitely tempting. You know, the censorship\nmachine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, like\nyou are going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting\n'cause it's so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people\nfeel any of this today. They should. I don't know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years\nlater, you know, you would hope that you would realize that\nyour soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being, you know, extremely authoritarian\nand anti-democratic and anti-Western. - Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the\nmost powerful human on Earth. - I'm not sure about that. - You don't think he is? - Well, he doesn't have the nukes so. - Nukes. (Marc laughing) Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? - Yeah. - How can he and/or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting\naspects of this power? - I mean, I think the\ndanger is there with power. It's flat out there. I would say with Elon, we'll see. I would say with Elon, and\nI would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would\nsay so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost\nevery front for like, you know, the last 30 years. (Lex laughing) But including all this stuff recently, like I think he's been a\nreal hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say,\nI guess the sort of case that he has this level of\npower is that some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are, you know, are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is, I do think a lot of how\nElon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's the companies\nhe's running directly where I think he's doing very well, and we're investors in multiple\nof them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements, and then it's the downstream\neffects of his statements. So like for example, it's, you know, for the last couple weeks,\nit's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this\nrape gang scandal, you know, this rape organized child\nrape thing in the UK. And you know, it's a preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren't willing to talk about it, it kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden\nthere's now in the UK this like massive explosion\nof basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's\nkind of woken up and being like, \"Oh, my God,\nyou know, this is really bad.\" And there will be now, you know, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know,\nhe played the role of the boy who said, the emperor\nhas no clothes, right? But here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about\nsomething that was true, right? And so had he said it about\nsomething that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody\nover there instantly, they were like, \"Oh, yeah,\nhe's right,\" right? (laughs) Like nobody seriously\nsaid they're just arguing the details now. So number one, it's like,\nokay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far... Put it this way. Like, how worried are we about\nsomebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say,\nespecially in the last decade of what we've been through where everybody's been lying\nall the time about everything, I'd say, I think we\nshould run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the\nmoney and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like it,\nthere's a clear-cut case that the more money in\npolitics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic\nof public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary\noutspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost. You'll notice that money and\npolitics has all most vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Trump spent far, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don't know, something like 3 billion total in Trump, I think spent again like a\nthird or a fourth of that. And so the money in politics kind of topic has kind of vanished from\na popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit\nnow that Elon is spending. You know, but again, it's like, okay, he's spending,\nbut the data would seem to indicate in the last, at\nleast in the last eight years, that money doesn't win\nthe political battles. It's actually like the\nvoters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there I\nwould say like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and use in a definitive way. - And I don't know if\nthose parallels there, but I could also say\njust on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that's not always the case. So that's a good thing there.\n- Yeah. - If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. (laughs) Who gets to put on the ring? - [Marc] Frodo. - Frodo, yeah.\n- Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of\n\"Lord of the Rings\" right, is even Frodo would've been, you know, even Frodo would've been corrupted, right? But, you know, nevertheless,\nyou had somebody who could do what it took at at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because it's sort of our\npost-Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort of this post-secularized\nChristian context in the West now, and it's, you know, we\nconsider Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe\nessentially all the same things. We just dress them up\nin sort of fake science. (Lex laughing) So the one thing that we're all told, we're all taught from early is that the best people in\nthe world are the people who care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know,\nall of our figures are people who care about all of, you know... Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared\nabout all of humanity. Like it's this universe, the person who cares the\nmost about everybody. And with Elon, you have a\nguy who literally, like, is, he talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly\nthe same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us through\nmulti-planetary civilization, so that we can survive a\nstrike on any one planet, so that we can extend the\nlight of human consciousness into the world and, you\nknow, into the universe and have it persist, you know, in the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. (both laughing) - Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. - Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear. - You said that we\nalways end up being ruled by the elite of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? - So this comes from a\nItalian political philosopher from about 100 years ago named Robert... I'm gonna mangle it from, let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. And then I learned about\nit through a famous book on politics, probably the\nbest book on politics written in the 20th century called \"The Machiavellians\"\nby this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in \"The Machiavellians,\" he resurrects what he calls is this sort of Italian realist school of political philosophy from the '10s and '20s. And\nthese were people, to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who\nwere trying to understand the actual mechanics of how\npolitics actually works. So to get to the actual sort\nof mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, Michels\nhad this concept ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law of oligarchy, and I mean take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy 'cause it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there's basically three\nforms of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of many. There's oligarchy, which\nis rule of the few. And there's monarchy,\nwhich is rule of the one. And you can just use that\nas a general framework of any government you're gonna be under is gonna be one of those,\njust mechanical observation without even saying\nwhich one's good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that\nMichels asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like is there actually\nsuch a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually\nlike direct government? And what he did was he mounted this sort of\nincredible historical exploration of whether democracies had\never existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most\ndemocratic private organization in the world that he\ncould find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist\nGerman autoworkers union that was like wholly\ndevoted to the workers of the world uniting, you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization\nout of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and\nhe is like, \"Oh, nope.\" There's a leadership class. You know, there's like six guys at the top and they control everything (laughs) and then they lead the rest\nof the membership along, you know, by the nose, which is, of course, the\nstory of every union. The story of every union is\nalways the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers' union, right? Like, you know, there's\na guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number\ntwo is his son, right? Like, that's not like a, you\nknow, an accident, right? So the iron law oligarchy\nbasically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling\nelite structurally. And he said, \"The reason for that is because the masses\ncan't organize,\" right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is\n25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize,\nthe majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in\npolitics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a\nsmall organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence... I forget the name of it. It was called like The Workers' Revolt or something like that. There was like a two-year period where they basically experimented\nwith direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition\nsystem, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. You know, anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes\nit's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe, and it's caused enormous\ndamage to the state. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And so of course, they didn't\ngive us a direct democracy, they gave us a representative\ndemocracy, right? And so they built the\noligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch\nand the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson\nof \"The Machiavellians\" is you can deny that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think\nabout how to make a system work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that\nis actually what's happening. - And lucky for us, the founders saw this\nand figured out a way to, given that there's going\nto be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite-\n- Yes. - So it doesn't get out of hand. - And it was very clever. Right? And you know, some of this was\nbased on earlier experiments. By the way, you know, these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of like Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance\nhistory, you know, \"The Federalist Papers,\" they\nargue this a great length. You can read it all. You know, they ran like a\none of the best seminars in world history trying\nto figure this out. And they went through all this and yeah. And so they thought\nthrough it very carefully, but just, I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did it just through the three\nbranches of government, right? Executive, legislative and judicial, sort of balance of powers. But the other way, they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done earlier. I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, right? And so the, you know,\nthe House and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population,\nand the Senate is not, right? The small states have\njust as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get\nreelected every two years to make it very responsive\nto the will of the people. And they made the decision\nto have the Senate get reelected every six years\nso that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose\none or the other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does\nit live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And you know, there's lots of open\nquestions there, but you know, this system has survived\nfor coming on 250 years with a country that has been\nspectacularly successful. But I don't think, at least,\nyou know, I don't think any of us would trade the\nsystem for any other one. And so it's, yeah, one of the\ngreat all-time achievements. - Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were\nall pretty young relative to our current set of leaders.\n- They were. Many in their 20s at the\ntime, and like super geniuses. This is one of those things\nwhere it's just like, all right, something happened where there\nwas a group of people where, you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einsteins of politics. Yeah. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical\npractice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused\non what would actually work, which is, you know, I\nthink the way to think about these things. - There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. - They were shape rotators,\nnot word cells. (laughs) - I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were center to them, you're center to a lot of memes. - [Marc] I was. - You're the meme dealer\nand the meme popularizer. - That's true. That meme I get some credit for and then the current thing is, the other one I get some credit for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. - Take credit and run with it. - [Marc] Yep. - If we can just linger\non the Machiavellians. It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned looking\nat the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've\nseen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting\nthings you can sort of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? - Yeah, so a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this\na bit with the universities, which is you can apply a\nMachiavellian-style lens to the... It's why I posed the\nquestion to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the\nuniversity, the trustees, the administration, the\nstudents or the faculty? And you know, the true\nanswer is some combination of the three or of the\nfour, plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera, right? And so you know, there's a mechanical\ninterpretation of that. I mean, companies operate\nunder the exact same, you know, set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like the CEO runs the\ncompany basically up to the day that either the shareholders\nor the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt,\nit's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it's very hard for the\nCEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if The New\nYork Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand\nis who can get who fired? You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper\ncolumnist who makes, you know, $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes, you\nknow, $200 million a year. And it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before\nI have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. - Did anyone ever get fired\nfrom the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? (laughs) So Bill like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. - No, 'cause what happens\nis they wear it with a... And yeah, I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, right? Which is, you know, if\nthey're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably\npriding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to legitimate criticism and, you know, they're\nobviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight\nto the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. You know, and I happen to know the CEO, and I think he's quite a good CEO, but I like, well, this is a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer\nrun his own company, right? Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating\nplaying out right now. Not to dwell on these fires, but you see the pressure\nreveals things, right? And so if you've been\nwatching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, like whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical\nsocial revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It's endorses every crazy\nleft-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of\nall the people who, you know, are currently burning\nthe city to the ground. It's just like endorsed\nevery single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, for the first time, I think put his foot down right\nbefore the November election and said, we're getting... He said, \"We're gonna get outta this thing where we just always\nendorse the Democrat.\" And we said, we're not\nendorsing, I think he said, \"We're not endorsing for the presidency.\" And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like our billionaire backer who's... And I don't know what he spends, but like, he must be burning 50 or 100\nmillion dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. He paid 500 million for\nit, which is amazing. Back when people still thought\nthese things were businesses. And then he's probably\nburned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another\n50, 100 million a year to do this. And the journalists at\nthe LA Times hate him with the fury of 1,000 suns. Like they just like absolutely\nfreaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones that\ncan get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, you know,\nmost horrible things about him. And they wanna constantly run\nthese stories attacking him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in\nLA are having right now to this fire, and to this just like\nincredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head\nendorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour,\nhe's basically just, he's decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his\nown newspaper. (laughs) Very smart guy. He is not a press tour and\nhe is basically saying, yeah, yes, we did all that and we\nendorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and\nwe're gonna completely change. And his paper is, you know,\nin a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn't been him. (laughs) It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, the\nowner is showing up saying, \"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge.\" And the reporters are\nsaying, \"No, you're not.\" And like it is freaking on. And so again, if the, the\nMachiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power\nactually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and super powerful who even\nowns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full-scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist? - And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there. - And firing people.\n- Firing people. Yeah. - You know, he has removed\npeople and he has set new rules. I mean, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying he's now at long last actually\nexercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other\nowners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know, so\nhe's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really\ninteresting open question. Like, you know, in a fight\nbetween the employees and the employer, like\nit's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. - And just to stay on\njournalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just wanna say put him in\nthe category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever\nseen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. - What do you think is like\nthe most impressive example? - Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to, like, I mean, it's like kicking\nthe beehive or whatever, you know, what's gonna follow and do that. I mean that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia\nand then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer\njust tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. And just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people\nlike that out in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be\ncourageous themselves. - Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? - I knew of Neri, his wife, who's a brilliant\nresearcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she's amazing. - Well, the reason I ask\nif you knew about Bill is because a lot of people\nhad not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before some of the\ncampaigns he's been running since in public, and with\nHarvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he was so-called activist\ninvestor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected\nfor probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out, they weren't for the most part battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national\nstories, but in the business and investing world, the\nactivist investor is a very, it's like in the movie \"Taken.\" It's a very specific set of skills. (both laughing) - Yeah. - On how to like really take control of situations.\n- Yeah. - And how to wreck the people\nwho you're going up against. And there's been\ncontroversy over the years on this topic, and there's\ntoo much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid is,\nyou know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly\nmanaged or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that\nmeans the existing management is become entrenched and\nlazy, mediocre, you know, whatever. Not, you're responding to the\nneeds of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically\ngo in with a minority position and then they rally support\namong other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show\nup and they force change. But they are the\naggressive version of this. And I've been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these-\n- Oh-oh. - Where it is amazing\nhow much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don't have formal control. So it would be another chess\npiece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens\nis the effective analysts, a large amount of time, they end up taking over\ncontrol of companies even though they never own more than like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it\nturns out with Bill's, it's such a fascinating case. 'Cause he has that like complete skillset. - (laughs) Yeah. - And he has now decided\nto bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of\nthese places, you know, and some of these battles\nare still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of\npeople who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now\nwith infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that\nkind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook, like in real time. And so Liam Neeson skillset is\ngetting more broadly diffused just by being able to\nwatch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody\nwho's really affecting how all this is playing out. - But even skillset\naside just courage and- - Yes, including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, 'cause like he hasn't been, I'll give you an example. Like my firm venture\ncapital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I\nfeel like I can't do or say 'cause I feel like I would\nbe bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where\nhe worries about that. And so a couple things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship\nwith his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors...\nI know this for a fact. His investors have been\nremarkably supportive of him doing that. 'Cause as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. And so it is the same thing he does in the his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip\nof the spear on something that actually a lot\nmore people agree with. - Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. - And just again, our, you know, how I started is a lot of\npeople are just fed up. - You've been spending a\nbunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new\nadministration in many ways, including interviewing\npeople who might join. So what's your general\nsense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new administration? - So I should start by saying I'm not a member of\nthe new administration. I'm not like in the room\nwhen a lot of these people are being selected. - I believe you said unpaid intern. - I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and I,\nyou know, when helpful, but I'm not making the decisions,\nnor am I in a position to, you know, speak for the administration. So I don't wanna say anything that would cause people\nto think I'm doing that. It's a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is outta office, and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll recall,\nthere was a fair amount of controversy over the\nend of the first term. - Oh, yeah. - The specific concern was, you know, the first Trump administration, you know, they will all say this is like, they didn't come in with a team, right? So you know, they didn't\ncome in with a team and most of the sort of institutional base of the Republican Party\nwere Bush Republicans. And many of them had\nbecome never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time\nputting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time\ngetting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them 2 to 3\nyears to kind of even get the government in place. And then they basically only\nhad the government in place, you know, for basically like\n18 months, and then COVID hit. You know, and then sort of\nthe aftermath and everything, and all the drama and\nheadlines and everything. And so the concern, you know, including from some various smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he gonna be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? 'Cause maybe people got burned out. Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing\nto go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people\nin the first term came under, like, you know, with their\nown withering legal assaults, and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a\nlot of stuff happened, lots of investigations,\nlots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots\nof debanking, by the way. A lot of the officials in the\nfirst Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. - Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. - In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and\nchildren with our ring of power. And so there's like\nthis legitimate question as to like, whether, okay, what will the team for\nthe second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing\nwith the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks\nbetter than the first term and not 'cause the\npeople in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like, influx of like incredibly\ncapable people that have shown up that wanna be part of this, and you just didn't have\nthat the first time. And so they're just\ndrawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than\nthey had the first time. And they're drawing on people\nwho know what the game is. Like they're drawing\non people now who know what is gonna happen and\nthey're still willing to do it. And so they're gonna\nget, I think, you know, some of the best people\nfrom the first term, but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get\nthe first time around. And then second is\nthere's a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they're just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned\nhow everything works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view and now they're 10 years older and they're ready to\ngo serving government. And so there's a\ngenerational shift happening. And actually one of the\ninteresting things about the team that's forming up is\nit's remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members,\nand then many of the second and third level people are\nlike in their 30s and 40s, you know, which is a big change\nfrom the gerontocracy that, you know, we've been under\nfor the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has\nbeen outstanding, you know, and we could sit here and\nlist tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people\nwho are running, you know, it's everything from the people who are running all the\ndifferent departments at HHS. It's the people running, you know, the number two at the\nPentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got, actually two of\nmy partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah, like many, many\nparts of the government, the people are like, really impressive. - Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the\nhuman being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's kind of circles\nof sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically\nsuck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good\nposition to speak to the degree that's happening versus\nhiring based on merit and just getting great teams. - Yeah, so look, I just\nstart by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are, you know, very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. Like he definitely seems\nvery aware of that. So that's one thing. I would just say that the, I\nthink the way to look at that, I mean, and look, like I said, I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say that it's again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished\npeople in the business world and in the medical field. I just, you know, Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH, so I was actually, I was\npart of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. - Nice. Jay's amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. - So I literally got, this is a story. I got to the transition\noffice for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the\ninterview interviewing teams, and they gave us, I didn't\nknow who the candidates were, and they gave us the\nsheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I\nsaw Jay's name, and I, like, I almost physically fell outta my chair. - Yeah. - And I was just like... (laughs) You know, and\nI happen to know Jay, I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like, talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure- - Yeah.\n- Over the last five years. - And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and\nthoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly- - Very serious, very\nanalytical, very applied. And yes, 100%. Tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look\nback at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you\nknow, none of us are perfect, but like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And, you know, we would all\nbe much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just like an\nincredibly capable guy. And look, and then he\nlearned from all that, right? He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody\nlike that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly. It's just a gigantic upgrade. You know, and then Marty\nMakary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a\nCDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been\nspending time with Dr. Oz, so, you know, and I'm not, like, again, I'm not on these teams. I'm not in the room. But like, I've been\nspending enough time trying to help that, like his level of insight into the healthcare system,\nit's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy\nwho's been like in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this\nstuff and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for,\nyou know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, he's like a walking\nencyclopedia on these things. And you know, very dynamic, you know, very charismatic, very\nsmart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have\nsomebody like that in there. And so anyway, they're\njust, I have like 30 of these stories now across\nall these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast\nto the last four years. And it, not even, these people\nare not in the same ballpark. They're just like wildly better. And so it, you know, the pound for pound is\nmaybe be the best team in the White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team\nlike this or something. But there's a lot of really\ngood people in there now. - Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to DOGE? What's the most wildly successful\nnext two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also, can you think\nabout the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges\nwould it be facing? - Yeah, so start by\nsaying, again, I'm not... Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer, I'm not on DOGE, (laughs)\nI'm not a member of DOGE. - We should say there's\nabout 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring. No, I'm just kidding. - Both the angels and\nthe devils on my shoulder are-\n- Okay. All right, cool. - So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE. I'm not in charge of DOGE.\n- Yeah. - Those guys are doing\nit, I'm not doing it. But you know, again,\nI'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, I mean, the basic outlines\nare in public, right? Which it's a time limited, you\nknow, basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the\nexecutive branch, right? And so the implementation\nwill happen through the White House. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is the three kind of streams,\nyou know, kind of target sets, and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. And so, you know, the headline\nnumber, they, you know, put us the $2 trillion number and there's already, you know, disputes over that and whatever, and there's whole question there. But then there's the people thing. And the people thing is\ninteresting 'cause you get into these very kind of\nfascinating questions. And I've been doing this,\nI won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this\nfor people in government as a pop quiz, and I can stump\nthem every time, which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere\nbetween 450 and 520. And nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for\nthe federal government? And the answer is, you know,\nsomething on the order, I forget, but like 4\nmillion full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large\npeople component to this. And then by the way, there's\na related component to that, which is how many of them\nare actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings\nare still empty, right? And then there's questions\nof like, are people, you know, working from home? Or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension, and of course, the money and\nthe people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing, right? And I described earlier\nhow basically our system of government is much more\nnow based on regulations than legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that\nwent through Congress. They're from an agency that,\nthat created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is, Elon have already described, we wanna do the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the\ngovernment off people's backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. But there's also something\nelse that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set\nof Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that\nwent directly after the idea that the executive branch can\ncreate regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding\ncongressional legislation. And most of the federal\ngovernment that exists today, including most of the departments\nand most of the rules, and most of the money,\nand most of the people, most of it is not enforcing\nlaws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \"Large parts, you know, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress,\nthe way that the cartoon said that it should, that may\nnot actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to, they\ndid nothing based on this. They didn't, you know,\npull anything back in. But the new regime, if they\nchoose to, could say, \"Look, the thing that we're doing here is not, you know, challenging the laws, we're actually complying with\nthe Supreme Court decision that basically says we have\nto unwind a lot of this, and we have to unwind the regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional, we have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people.\" And that's how you get from, basically you connect the\nthread from the regulation part back to the money part,\nback to the people part. They have work going on\nall three of these threads. They have, I would say,\nincredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super\ncynical on this topic. And they're like, \"This is impossible. This could never possibly work.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I can't tell you what the secret plans are,\nbut like blow my mind.\" And all three of those,\nlike, they have ideas that are like really quite\namazing as you'd expect from, you know, from the people involved. And so over the course of the\nnext few months, you know, that'll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is, this is going to be very\ndifferent than attempts, like there have been other\nprograms like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one, and then there were others\nbefore that, Reagan had one. The difference is this\ntime, their social media. And so there has never been like, it's interesting, one of the\nreasons people in Washington are so cynical is because\nthey know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad\nspending and all the bad rules and all the, like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion\ndollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that's compounding, and\nit's now passing the size of the defense department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon it's gonna\nbe adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be\nadding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point we enter a\nhyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or\nBrazil and (indistinct), right? And so, like everybody in\nDC knows that something has to be done, and then\neverybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible\nto do anything, right? They know all the problems and they also know the sheer\nimpossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're\nnot taking into account, that what the critics are not taking into account\nis these guys can do this in the full light of day and\nthey can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism, they can expose any element\nof, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government spending. They can run victory\nlapse every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the\npeople into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our\nMachiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy,\noligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of\nthe few, rule of the one. You could think about what's\nhappening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president, rule\nof the one with some power. And then we have the\npeople who can't organize, but they can be informed\nand they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich\nhappening right now, is a way to think about it, which is you've got basically (indistinct) if you got rule of one combining with the rule of many, right? And rule of many is they\ndo get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically. And then essentially\nCongress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic\nclass in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, I think have the power to\ndo all kinds of things here, and I think that would be\nthe way I would wash it. - The transparency. I mean, Elon, just by\nwho he is incentivized to be transparent and show\nthe bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's gonna be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just\nmakes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. - These people are spending our money. - [Lex] Yeah. - These people have enormous\ncontempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here's the thing\nyou hear in Washington, here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear\nis, \"This is impossible, they'll be able to do nothing.\" And then, yeah, I walk them\nthrough this and they're like, it starts to dawn on them that\nthis is a new kind of thing. And then they're like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in\nentitlements and the debt and the military.\" And so like, yeah, you've\ngot like this silly, fake whatever, you know,\nNPR funding or whatever, and like, it's a rounding\nerror and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever,\n$500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging\nstations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they bill eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And costs you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn't matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer\nis like, \"What the fuck?\" (Lex laughing) - What do you mean?\n- It's $30 billion. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then the experts are like, and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's surrounding error.\" No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this\ncavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you're\nabout the 3 trillion. - Yeah.\n- Okay. Then there's the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the\nfederal budget and percentage? No, it's not. But $30 billion divided\nby 30, do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like, what's that math expert? - $100. - $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic\nrelationship with your wife. There's like 100 things\nthat that person can do with $100 that they're not doing 'cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where\nthe money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that $30\nbillion program is not something that is like a very\nimportant thing to go after, is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer-\n- Yeah. - Is just off the charts. And then that's just\none of those programs, there's like 100 of those programs and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of\nthis stuff is running well, like the one thing we know is that none of this\nstuff is running well. Like we know that for sure, right? And we know these people\naren't showing up to work and like we know that all this crazy stuff is happening, right? And like, you know, do you remember Elon's\nstory of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. Okay so Pennsylvania is\nlike a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness, and death, right? And the federal government\nhas just like, let it happen, these incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing\nlaw enforcement thing that they needed to do in\nPennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling\nraw milk with armed raids. - [Lex] Right. - And it turns out it\nreally pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places\n'cause they don't have cars. But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the\nreasons why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law\nenforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, like the system's not working. And so you add up, just\npick $130 billion programs. All right, now you're okay. Math major, 100 times 100. - 10,000. - $10,000. Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. - But it's also not just about money. That's really, obviously money\nis a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude- - [Marc] Yes. - That then in sort of, in\nthe ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody\nwants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that corruption\ncan, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy 'cause you don't wanna be transparent about having done nothing all\nyear, all this kind of stuff. And you now wanna reverse that, so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government,\nbecause the amazing thing if you're to steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can\ndirectly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting. As long as there's no\nbureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. - Yeah. So here's the trick, this blew my mind 'cause I was, you know, once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in\ngovernment called impoundment. And so if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning\nis a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires\nCongress to authorize money to be spent by the\nexecutive branch, right? So the executive branch\ngoes to Congress says, \"We need money X.\" Congress does their thing. They come back and they\nsay, \"You can have money Y.\" The money's appropriated from Congress, the executive branch\nspends it on the military or whatever they spend it\non, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations\nto nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an\nadditional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which\nis the executive branch not only needs Congress to\nappropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is\nnot allowed to underspend. - Yeah, I'm aware of\nthis. I'm aware of this. - And so there's this thing\nthat happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal\nyear, which is September 30th, and it's the great budget flush. And any remaining money\nthat's in the system that they don't know how\nto productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively. - Yep. - To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn't wanna spend the\nmoney can't not spend it. - Yeah. - Like, okay, A, that's not\nwhat's in the constitution. And there's actually quite\na good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that's played\nout in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I\nthink an open mind, you're like, \"All right, this is not\nwhat the founders meant.\" And then number two, again,\nwe go back to this thing of contempt, like, can\nyou imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you're\ndoing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've\nsold your soul, right? Like it's just like, I actually\nthink you sort of had it in a really good point,\nwhich is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. - Yeah.\n- Right. 'Cause it makes them bad people. And they didn't start out\nwanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this like- - Yeah, everywhere.\n- Everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged\nwhat I've seen so far. - It seems like a lot of people\nwill try to slow 'em down, but yeah-\n- For sure. - I hope they get far.\n- Yeah. - Another difficult topic, immigration. - [Marc] Yeah. - What's your take on the, let's say, heated H-1B visa debate\nthat's going on online and legal immigration in general? - Yeah, I should so start by saying, I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I'm not planning to be,\nthis is not an issue that I'm working on or\nthat I'm going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing.\nSo my firm is doing, so like, I'm not in this in the new\nadministration or the government. I'm not planning to be, so\npurely just personal opinion. So I would say I would\ndescribe as a complex or nuanced, hopefully\nnuanced view on this issue that's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I kind of thought\nabout this, you know, I didn't say anything about\nit all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a\nlot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a\nvery different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because\nof the combination of where I came from and\nthen where I ended up. And so, oh, let's start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration\nargument many, many times the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been\nin DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of\ntrying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more\nhigh-skilled immigration. And, you know, I think that\nargument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, has paid off for the\nUS in many, many ways. And we can go through it,\nbut I think it's the argument everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's, right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. - So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you\ncan get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity\nof the US companies. - Yeah, and then it's not just good for the them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry,\nit's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that\nthen create many more jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would've previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Like everybody wins,\nthere are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely\nglorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be\na moral right argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against\nit is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right, I mean that-\n- Right. - That's the thing. And like I said, I've made\nthat argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd also say, look,\nI would say number one, I believe a lot of it,\nI'll talk about the parts I don't believe, but\nI believe a lot of it. And then the other part is,\nlook, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, like\nmy own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends, you know,\nare just this like amazing, you know, panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And you know, I've worked,\nI dunno at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And hopefully, over time, it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And you know, it's been amazing and they've done many of\nthe most important things in my industry and it's\nbeen really remarkable. So that's all good. And then, you know, there's\njust the practical version of the argument, which\nis we are the main place these people get educated anyway, right? The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, this is the old kind of Mitt\nRomney, staple a green card to every, you know, at least, you know, maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologist\nwe could quibble about, but you know, the roboticist\nfor sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- - At least I won you\nover on something today. - Well, no, I'm\nexaggerating for effect, so- - Oh. (Marc laughing) And I lost you,\nI had you for half a second. - I haven't gotten to the\nother side of the argument yet. - [Lex] Okay, thank you.\n- So surely, we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. - The rollercoaster is going up. - The rollercoaster is\nrationing slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists\nshould all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot\nof merit to that, obviously. Like, look, we want the\nUS to be the world leader in robotics. What step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the\ngreat robotics people, right? Like, you know, very,\nunlike the underpants. No, it's like a very\nstraightforward formula, right? - Yeah. - All right, that's all\nwell and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that you also hear from,\nyou know, these same people, and I have made this\nargument myself many times, which is, we need to do this because we don't have\nenough people in the US who can do it otherwise, right? We have all these unfilled\njobs, we've got all these, you know, all these companies\nthat wouldn't exist. We don't have enough good founders, we don't have enough engineers, we don't have enough scientists. Or then the next version\nof the argument below that is our education\nsystem is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way, 'cause like our education\nsystem is good enough for foreigners to be able\nto come here preferentially in like a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native-born people. So there's like a weird, there's\nlittle cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into and kind of wonder about, and we'll come back to that one. But like, at least, yes, our\neducation system has its flaws. And then underneath that is\nthe argument that, you know, Vivek made, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, you know, native-born\npeople in the country, you know, don't work hard enough, and spend too much time\nwatching TV and TikTok and don't spend enough\ntime studying differential, you know, equations. And again, it's like, all\nright, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair amount to that. Like there's a lot of American\nculture that is, you know, there's a lot of frivolity,\nthere's a lot of, you know, like, I mean, we have\nwell-documented social issues in many fronts, many things that cut\nagainst having a culture of just like straightforward\nhigh achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those\nare the basic arguments. But then I have this kind of\nother side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought\nprocess, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And you know, it's interesting,\nthere's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin\nto, you know, high tech. And so it's like, all right,\nwhy is that exactly, right? And then I know this, I'm an aberration. Like I was the only one\nfrom anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right? I know what an aberration I am, and I know exactly how\nthat aberration happened, and it's a very unusual,\nyou know, set of steps, including, you know,\nmany that were just luck. But like, there is in\nno sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like, not at all. There is also like, in no sense\na talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from\nthe South into high tech. There is no flow from the\nSunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the Deep South into high tech. Just like, literally it's like the blank. There's this whole section of the country that just where the people\njust like for some reason don't end up in tech. Now, that's a little bit strange, 'cause these are the people\nwho put a man on the moon. These are the people who built\nthe World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the Second\nIndustrial Revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network, and built, you know,\nlogistics and transportation in the auto in, I mean,\nthe auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people's\nparents and grandparents and great grandparents\nsomehow had the wherewithal to like build all of\nthis like amazing things, invent all these things. And then there's many,\nmany, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism\nwhere you had people who grew up in the middle of\nnowhere, Philo Farnsworth, who invented the television,\nand just like, you know, tons and tons of others,\nendless stories like this. Now you have a, like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, okay, like what is happening on\nthe blank spot of the map? And then of course, you\nalso can't help noticing that the blank spot on the\nmap, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, \"Oh,\nwell, that's interesting. Like how did that happen?\" Right? And so either you really,\nreally, really have to believe the very, very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you\nhave to believe that like, that basically culture, the\nwhole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country\nis so like, deeply flawed, either inherently flawed\nor culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they are not able to do the\nthings that their, you know, parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess\non what else is happening? - You mean what, affirmative action? - Affirmative action. Okay. (laughs) This is\nvery, think about this, this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. - Right. - Nor does it have any victims at all. - That could explain\nmaybe disproportionate, but like, surely it doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. - What educational institution\nin the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? - But what institution rejected\nfarm boys from Wisconsin? - All of them.\n- All of them. - Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this\nis because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago, these were big court cases. And you know, 'cause the\nidea of affirmative action has been litigated for\nmany, many, many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly\nin the past had upheld that it was a completely\nlegitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative action that\nlike really matter, right? One is the admissions into\neducational institutions, and then the other is jobs, right? Getting hired. Like, those are the two biggest areas. The education one is like super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time, for all, you know, people have written and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments\nfor why it's important, there's many arguments as\nto how it could backfire. It's been this thing. But the Supreme Court upheld\nit for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer, I don't\nhave the exact reference in my head, but there was a\ncase in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O'Connor famously\nwrote that, you know, although it had been 30\nyears of affirmative action, and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended,\nshe said that, you know, well, basically we need to\ntry it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically\nthe issues it's intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming\nup on the 25 years, right? It's a couple years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases is, it's a Harvard case and I think a University\nof North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those\ncases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions\nactually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit\nas cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it's a ring of power. And if you're an admissions\nofficer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power\nto do what you want, and you can justify any of\nit under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases,\nit had been a black box where you didn't have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically\nrequired showing the work. And there was like all kinds\nof like phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there\nwere text messages in there that will just curl your hair of people, of students being spoken of and just like crude racial stereotypes that would just make you\nwant to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. But also, there was\nstatistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is\nthat at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs\nfor SAT that are as wide as 400 points, right? So different groups. So a specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points\nhigher than other ethnicities in order to actually\nget admitted into these. I mean, this is not even about, I mean, white people are a part of this, but like Asians are like\na very big part of this. And actually the Harvard\ncase is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students\nwho were being turned away. And it's basically, I\nmean it's the cliche now in the valley and in\nthe medical community, which is like if you want a super genius, you hire an Asian from Harvard 'cause they are guaranteed\nto be freaking Einstein. 'Cause if they weren't, they were never getting admitted, right? Almost all the qualified\nAsians get turned away. So they've been running this,\nit's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been\na third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really\nchanged the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthey can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a\nsingle education institution in America that is conforming\nwith the Supreme Court ruling. I think they're all\nflagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. - Mostly 'cause of\nmomentum probably, or what? - They are trying to make\nthe world a better place. They're trying to solve\nall these social problems. They are trying to have\ndiverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They're trying to make\ntheir faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they're good people. - [Lex] Right. - They're trying to have\nthe press write nice things about them. Like it's nearly impossible for them. And you know, to be clear,\nlike nobody has been fired from an admissions office for,\nyou know, 25 years of prior, what we now, the Supreme Court now is\nruled to be illegality. And so they're all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so like I, you know, the numbers are moving a little bit, but like, I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they're\ncompliant with the Supreme Court. Like who's in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university's rule of the\nSupreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules\nthe universities, right? Well, another example of that is, I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right\nnow went to either Harvard or Yale, right? Like the level of\nincestuousness here is... Anyway, so there's that. And so this has been running\nfor a very long time. So one is the Harvard and\nUSC cases kind of gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the\nother thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was\nhappening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at\nall the top institutions for Jewish applicants was\nthey were being managed down, either being actively\nmanaged down as a percentage of the base. And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely\nexplicit, basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative\npercentage of the US population, which is 2%. And you know, there's\na whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago,\nJews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big\ncampaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became\n30% of these institutions 'cause there's so many\nsmart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been\ntrying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish\npeople I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, right? And so all of a sudden, so basically, the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this\nin terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in\nterms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? And then, of course, there's the thing that you\nbasically can't talk about, which is all the white\npeople are being excluded. And then it turns out it's\nalso happening to Black people, and this is the thing that like blew my freaking\nmind when I found out about it. So I just assumed that\nlike, this was great news for like American Blacks, because like, you know, obviously\nif you know Whites, Asians and Jews are being excluded,\nthen, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was\nto get the Black population up. And so this must be great\nfor American Blacks. So then I discovered this New\nYork Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? (laughs) - [Lex] Uh-oh. - And again, and by the way,\nthis is in The New York Times, this is not in like, you know, whatever, National Review,\nthis is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that\nwere quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the dean of the\nAfrican-American Studies, you know, community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme\nCourt appointee under, I think she was a close\nfriend of Hillary Clinton. And there was, for a long time, she was on the shortlist\nfor Supreme Court. So one of the top, you know, jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black was sort\nof legendarily successful in the academic and\nlegal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the\nauthorities in this story and the story that they tell, (laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education institutions and\nit's happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government, which\nis at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard\nwere not American-born Blacks. They were foreign-born Blacks, specifically, Northern\nAfrican off generally Nigerian or West Indian, right? And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very\nsuccessful Nigerian-Americans as a group like way outperformed, they're, you know, this a\nsuper smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said\nin the story is Harvard is basically struggling to\neither, whatever it was, identify or recruit, make successful, whatever it was,\nAmerican-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were\nusing high-skill immigration, as an escape hatch to go get\nBlacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs in the last 20 years have had\nthis exact characteristic. There's large numbers of\nBlack people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \"It's obviously not us that\nare getting these slots, we're literally competing with people who are being imported.\" And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action,\nyou are trying to make up for historical injustice\nof American Black slavery. So the idea that you're import\nsomebody from, you know, Nigeria that never\nexperienced that, you know, is like tremendously\ninsulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see\nwhere I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year\nsocial engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into, right? And so it turns out it's\nnot a victim-free thing, there's like 100%, there's victims. 'Cause why? There's only so many, for sure. There's only so many education slots. And then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs, right? You know, Google only\nhires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers, right? And so that's the other side of it, right? And so you're a farm\nboy in Wisconsin, right? You know, Black American\nwhose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship,\n300 years ago, in Louisiana or a, you know, Cambodian\nimmigrant in, you know, the Bronx and you are a kid or a Jewish\nimmigrant or a, you know, or from a very successful Jewish family and you know, your entire, you\nknow, for three generations, you and your parents and\ngrandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those\ngroups know is the system that has been created\nis not for them, right? It's designed specifically\nto exclude them. And then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, \"Yeah, let's bring\nin more foreigners,\" right? And so anyway, so the\nshort version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the, quote,\n\"high-skill immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also\nhaving the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another\nword for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative\naction conversation. And you need to actually\ndeal with this at substance and to see what's actually\nhappening to people. you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for\nhigh-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took\nover both the education process and the hiring process.\n- Okay, so first of all, that was brilliantly laid\nout, the nuance of it. So just to understand, it's\nnot so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to\nbe more people saying, yay, we need more American-born hires. - So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on\nthis and not saying anything, and what I was... (Lex laughing) Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of- - Yeah, that was very Zen. - Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of\nit, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the\ndog that didn't bark, right? And the dog that didn't\nbark was, I did not, and you tell me if you saw one, I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart\nkids who are already here into these educational\ninstitutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. - That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.\n- But it was like literally, it was like the proponents\nof high-skilled immigrant. And again, this was me\nfor a very long time. I mean, I kind of took\nmyself by surprise on this because I was on, you\nknow, I had the much, say, simpler version of this\nstory for a very... And like I said, I've been\nin Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But you know, I've been on\nthe other side of this one, but I was literally sitting\nthere being like, all right, which of these like super\ngeniuses who, you know, many of whom by the\nway are very, you know, successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled\nimmigrants, you know, which of these super\ngeniuses are gonna like, say actually we have this like\nincredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about native-born\nAmericans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure. Those four groups. - But also-\n- Yes. - White people. - Yeah, and also white people. - People that are making the\ncase for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're\nmaking that case are often not making it in a way that's like, making it in quite a radical way. - Yeah.\n- Let's put it this way. - Yeah, but you have\nthis interesting thing, you have a split between\nthe sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. - Right. - Right, and I'm using air\nquote for people listening to audio. I'm making quotes\nin the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can.\n- Yep. - One side has all the certified experts. The other side just has a\nbunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite\nknow how to explain it. And what was so unusual\nabout the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of Supreme Court, is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time, actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record, they actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, 'cause if you don't have\nexperts, what do you have? You know, something is wrong, but you have primarily\nan emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, you know, that\na certified expert can? And no, you can't, like, you\nknow, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. Yeah, and so it's just\nlike, all right, now, by the way, look, I think there are ways\nto square the circle, I think there's a way to\nhave our cake and eat it too, like I think there'd be\nmany ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with\nhigh-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is\nunder much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for\nuniversities to do that, they are still doing it,\nbut they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part, that's happening\nfor a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate\nlawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court\nrulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just as a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let add one more nuance to it that makes it even more complicated. - Yeah. - So the cliche is we're gonna\nbrain drain the world, right? You've heard that? We're gonna take all the smart people from all over the world,\nwe're gonna bring them here, we're gonna educate them, and\nthen we're gonna keep them, and then they're gonna\nraise their families here, create businesses here,\ncreate jobs here, right? - In the cliche, that's\na super positive thing. - Yeah. Okay, so what happens to\nthe rest of the world? - They lose? - Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious,\nhighly conscientious, highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that\nmany and they all come here and they all aren't where\nthey would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So it's almost impossible\nfor us here to have that conversation, in part because we become\nincredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just\nsimply all the same, which is a whole thing\nwe could talk about. But it also, we are purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the\nworld, not the other way around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow\nof high-skilled immigration over time, there's only\nfour permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration\nplaces people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. - Oh, Australia. - It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four\ncountries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk\nabout this I've discovered because the Eurozone\nis, whatever, you know, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over\ntime have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I\nthink it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've\nbeen migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this\nreally hit the fan was in Greece, right? So, you know, Greece falls\ninto chaos, disaster, and then, you know, you're\nrunning the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic\ndevelopment plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. Like, what are you gonna do, right? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. Not because, in part, because of this, 'cause we enthusiastically\nrecruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining\nUkraine for a long time. But also, of course,\nyou know, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, you know, when it comes\ntime for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it\ngonna have the talent base even that it had five years ago is like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, like\nwe have brain drained a lot of really smart people outta Russia, a lot of them are here, right? Over the last, you know, 30 years. And so there's this thing, it's actually really funny\nif you think about it. Like, the one thing that\nwe know to be the height of absolute evil that the\nWest ever did was colonization and resource extraction, right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and\nthe English and you know, everybody else went and had\nthese colonies and then went in and we, you know, took all the oil and we took all the diamonds,\nor we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason we realized\nthat's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's\ncompletely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious\nand beautiful and wonderful and you know, the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral\njustice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one\nsecond what we're doing to the countries that we're\npulling all these people out of. And this is one of these\nthings like, I don't know, like maybe we're just gonna live in this delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't care what happens, but like, I think there may come, this is like one of these submarines 10 feet under the waterline. Like, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly\nrealize, \"Oh, my God, what are we doing?\" 'Cause like, we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? Like we need these other\ncountries to like flourish. Like we don't wanna be the\nonly successful country in the middle of just like\ncomplete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and\nwe extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it. - Well, this is so deeply\nprofound, actually. So what is the cost\n\"winning\" quote, unquote, if these countries are drained\nin terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics,\nwhat does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually\nwant them to be strong in the way we understand\nstrong, not just in every way. So that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. - Yep. - It's interesting, this is one of those\ntruths where you just speak and it resonates, and I\ndidn't even think about it. - [Marc] Yeah, exactly. - So you were sitting\nduring the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that said-\n- Yeah. - There's still to use\nsome good to the H-1B? - Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's- - Come all the way around. (laughs) - There's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance,\nwhich is mostly the valley, we don't use H-1Bs anymore,\nmostly we use O-1s. So there's a separate class of these, and the O-1 is like this, it turns out the O-1 is\nthe super genius visa. So the O-1 is the basically our founder, like when we have somebody\nfrom anywhere in the world and they've like invented a\nbreakthrough new technology, and they wanna come to\nthe US to start a company, they come in through an O-1 visa. And that actually is like\na, it's a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, but it's like a pretty high\nbar. And they do a lot of work and there's like a, you have\nto put real work into it and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened\nwith the H-1B visa program is that it has gone to\nbasically two categories of employers. One is the basically a small\nset of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies\nthat you would think. And then the other is, it goes to these, they call kind of the mills,\nthe consulting mills, right? And so there's these set\nof companies with names, I don't wanna pick on\ncompanies, but you know, names like Cognizant that, you know, hire, basically have their business model is bring in primarily\nIndians in large numbers, and you know, they often have, you know, offices next to company-owned housing. And they'll have, you know,\norganizations that are, you know, they'll have,\nyou know, organizations that are literally thousands\nof Indians, you know, living and working in the US and they do basically call it\nmid-tier, like IT consulting. So you know, these folks,\nthey're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a year or $100,000 a year, not the, you know, 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, like in practice, the startups, basic like\nlittle tech as we call it, or the startup world,\nmainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point and mainly can't, 'cause the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of\nunderlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, you know, Amazon, like Amazon's a\nin like I love Amazon, but like they're a big powerful company. You know, they've got, you\nknow, more money than God. They've got resources, they've got long-term\nplanning horizon, they do big, you know, profound things over,\nyou know, decades at a time. You know, they could, you know, or any of these other companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you know, you'll\nnotice they don't do that. You know, they bring in, you know, 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, like,\nthere's lots of questions around them and whether\nthey should, you know, whether that's even a\nethical way to, you know, I don't wanna say they're\nunethical, but there's questions around like exactly what\nthe trade-offs are there. Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, you know, nobody\nreally wanted to be opened, you know, to play devil's\nadvocate on all this in terms of like national\nimmigration issues, you know, none of this is like a top end issue just 'cause the numbers are small, right? And so, you know, I don't think, you know, the administration has said like, this is not like a priority\nof theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is like, there is actually a lot of\ncomplexity and nuance here. I have a lot of friends,\nlike I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues\nwho are, you know, who came over on H-1Bs,\nor O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens and you know, every single\none that one of them was not every single one, a lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the honor of immigrants throughout\nthis whole period. And they said to me,\nit's like, \"Well, Marc, you know, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance\nof high-skilled immigration to the US?\" And I was like, I think\nyou can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent and be like, do you\nwanna inflame the issue or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right? And I think the answer\nis to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one\nmore positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up\non the university some more. Do you know about the National\nMerit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? - Not really, can you explain? - So there's a system that was\ncreated during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when... It was when people in\ngovernment actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an ideas that sounds today. And so it's basically a\nnational talent search for basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify\nbasically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of\nother characteristics. So there's no race, gender,\nor any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory\nSAT that you take, and then the SAT. So it uses those scores,\nthat is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. So they use the SAT as a\nproxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to like 1% of\nthe population of the kids, 18 year olds any given year\nwho scored highest on the PSAT, and then they get down to\nlike further qualify down to the 0.5% that also\nreplicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right? So it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the\nbest and the brightest. How many of our great and\npowerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities\nall have sports teams, they all have national scouting,\nthey have full-time scouts who go out and they go\nto every high school and they try to find all\nthe great basketball players and bring them into the\nNCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities\nuse the National Merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids\nand just bring them in? - Let me guess, very few. Zero.\n- Zero. (laughs) - As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that\nsame level of scouting for talent internally. - Go get the smartest ones. I'll give you one more\nkicker on this topic if I haven't beaten it to death. You know, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a\nhighly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like\nthe whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the\ncollege board that runs it. And it has been essentially\nlike everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so the in two ways, number one, it's been dumbed down where\nan 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost\nimpossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, right? And so, it's been\ndeliberately dumbed down. And then two is they have tried to pull out a lot of what's\ncalled the g-loading. And so they've tried to detach\nit from being an IQ proxy 'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable, right? So the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has\nreally started to work. And one of the things you\nsee is the Asian spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is\nbecause it's more coachable now. And the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the coaching\nthing is really difficult 'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents\ncan afford coaching, right? And I don't know about\nyou, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT\nwas until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. So, number one, there's issues there, but the other issue there is\nthink about what's happened by the dumbing down,\n800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It's like the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they\nhave AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. 'Cause what you want\nis you want, whatever, if it's gonna be 100,000\nkids, I don't know what it is, it's gonna be 50,000\nkids a year scoring 800. You also then want kids\nto be able to score 900 and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200, and you wanna ultimately get to, you know, you'd like to ultimately\nidentify the top 100 kids and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the\ntest has been reduced, so that it actually is\nnot useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption that's taken place\nthroughout this entire system where we have been heading\nin the reverse direction from wanting to actually go\nget the best and brightest and actually put them in the\nplaces where they should be. And then just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System\nis it's comp, like I said, it's completely race\nblind, it's gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic. It's only done on test scores. You know, and you can make\nan argument about whether that's good or bad, but\nit is, you know, for sure, you know, it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed\nmerit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose\nto do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it like incredibly striking and an enormous moral\nindictment of the current system that there are no universities\nthat do this today. So back to the immigration\nthing, just real quick. It's like, okay, we aren't even trying\nto go get the smart kids out of the center of-\n- Yeah. - And even if they think that they can get into these\nplaces, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for\nthe smart Black people. And like, it's just like,\nI don't know how, like, I don't know how that's moral. Like I don't get it at all. - As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times and I've always gotten\nperfect on math, 800. And I'm not that I'm not special like, it doesn't identify genius. I think you wanna search for genius and you wanna create\nmeasures that find genius of all different kinds,\nspeaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and\nover, defend immigrants. Yes. But say we should hire\nmore and more native-born. - Well, you asked me in the beginning like what's the most optimistic\nforecast, right, that we could have? And the most optimistic\nforecast would be, my God, what if we did both? (laughs) - So that's the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. - Well, it would diffuse the entire issue. - [Lex] Yeah. - If everybody in the center\nin the South of the country and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they\nwere getting a fair shake, like it would diffuse the issue. Like how about diffusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical... Sorry, I don't mean to really get out over my skis here, but- - I think your profile on X\nstates, \"It's time to build.\" It feels like 2025 is\na good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for\nanybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build\nsomething useful in the world or maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch\napps, services, whatever, ship software products. So maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? - So I mean, a big part\nof the answer I think is we're in the middle\nof a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking\nabout this on your show, but like AI coding, I mean,\nthis is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the investment of software. And I'm sure you, and you\nknow, we're involved in various of these companies, but\nyou know, these tools, you know, from a variety of companies are just like absolutely revolutionary and they're getting better by\nleaps and bounds every day. And you know, all this, but like the thing with coding, like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever. But like for sure, we\ncan make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate\nthe results of coding. And so, you know, there's all\nthese methods of, you know, synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is gonna get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean\nanybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and\nlook at AI coding demos, you know, little kids\nmaking apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. I mean I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary. You know, in a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain\nyourself, you know, start using these things, get\na huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more\nquickly than you could before. - That's actually a tricky\none in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like\nyou still need to learn how to code, it becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately\nbe a one person company and get quite far. - I agree with that, up to a point. So I think, for sure,\nfor quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are gonna be the best at\nactually having AI's code things, 'cause they're gonna understand\nwhat I mean, very basic. They're gonna understand\nwhat's happening, right? And they're gonna be able\nbe able to evaluate the work and they're gonna be able to, you know, literally like manage AIs better. Like even if they're not\nliterally handwriting the code, they're just gonna have\na much better sense of what's going on. So I definitely think\nlike 100% my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds of coding classes, and he'll keep doing that\nfor certainly through 18. We'll see after that. And so like for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you\ncan do with an AI is say, teach me how to code, right? And you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, I'll name names,\nyou know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing at\nKhan Academy for free. And then we, you know, we\nhave this company, Replit, which is was originally\nspecifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that's just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this and yeah, that, I mean, the\nAI's gonna be able to teach you to code, AI, by the way, is as you know, spectacularly good at\nexplaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools\nhave these features now where you can talk to the code base and so you can like literally like ask the code base\nquestions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and\npaste code into ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it\nwhat's going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so yeah, there's\ndozens of ways to do this. By the way, you can also, I mean even more broadly than code. Like, okay, you wanna make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art\ngeneration, sound generation, dialogue generation,\nvoice generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like,\nyou don't need designers, you know, you don't need, you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then, you know, a big is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's interfacing\ninto other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments\nor something like that. And, you know, AI's fantastic\nat writing glue code. So, you know, really,\nreally good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you\nfigure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write\na business plan for you. So it's just this, it's\nlike everything happening with AI right now, it's just, it's like this latent superpower and there's this incredible\nspectrum of people who have really figured out\nmassive performance increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't\neven aware it's happening. And there's some gearing to\nwhether you're a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races. And I think there are lots\nof professional coders who are still like, eh... You know, the blacksmiths were\nnot necessarily in favor of, you know, the car business. So yeah, there's the old\nWilliam Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just\nnot evenly distributed yet.\" And this is maybe the most\npotent version of that that I've ever seen. - Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" - Right.\n- It is very common. The programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true. I consider myself\nreasonably good programmer, and my productivity has\nbeen just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming\nis more efficient, more productive, more fun,\nall that kind of stuff. - I would also say code is, you know, code has of anything in\nlike industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the\neasier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's\nunlimited demand for code. Like, in other words, like\nthere's always some other idea for a thing that you can do,\na feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, like overwhelmingly, you know, the amount of code that\nexists in the world is a fraction of even\nthe ideas we have today. And then we come up with\nnew ideas all the time. And so I think that\nlike, (laughs) you know, I was in the late '80s, early '90s, when sort of automated\ncoding systems started to come out, expert systems,\na big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called the \"Decline and Fall of the\nAmerican Programmer,\" you know, that predicted that\nthese new coding systems were gonna mean we wouldn't\nhave programmers in the future. And of course, the number\nof programming jobs exploded by like a factor of 100. Like, my guess is we'll have\nmore coding jobs probably by like an order magnitude\n10 years from now. That will be different,\nthey'll be different jobs. They'll involve orchestrating\nAI, but there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry\nwill just explode in size. - Are you seeing the size\nof companies decrease in terms of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? - All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. - [Lex] Oh, for the big tech? - And little tech.\n- And little tech. - Everybody's trying to\nhire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it's 100%. I mean, there's a handful\nof company, you know, there's a little bit,\nthere's customer service, you know, we have some\ncompanies and others 'cause I think it's\nKlarna that's publicizing a lot of this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. But like for engineering jobs, like, it's just an explosion of hiring that at least, so far, there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am\nlooking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first\ncompany to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. So basically, the companies that we see are\nbasically one of two kinds. We see the companies that are basically sometimes\nuse weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies,\nI sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point\non whatever they're doing. - (laughs) Sure. - Right? And it's on the slide, right?\n- Yeah. - So they've got the, you know, whatever, da, da, da, da, da, and then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is, 'cause they had already\npreviously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the\nsix bullet point in the slide, which is how you're\ngetting all these products that have like the AI button\nup in the corner, right? The little sparkly button. - Yep.\n- Right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which\nI'm like, I don't need that. Like, I need you to answer\nmy email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay, so we see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then we see the strong\nform, which is the companies that are building from\nscratch for AI, right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally\nan AI email system, as an example, so just- - Oh, nice. I can't wait. - Yeah, they're gonna completely. So the very obvious idea,\nvery smart team, you know, it's gonna be great. And then, you know,\nNotion, just, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a\nproduct. And so now companies are gonna basically come through, sweep through, and they're gonna do\nbasically AI-first versions of basically everything. And those are like\ncompanies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. - Yeah, Cursor is an example of that. They basically said, okay,\nwe're gonna rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. - What if we knew from scratch\nthat we could build on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the Full Employment Act\nfor startups and VCs is, it just like if a\ntechnology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development\nprocess over from scratch, 'cause you need to\nreconceptualize the product, and then usually what that\nmeans is you need a new company 'cause most incumbents just won't do that. And so, yeah. So that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for is the\ncompany where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned\nas a result of AI, right? So I'm looking at, I'm\nwaiting for the company where it's like, no, we're\ngonna have, like, you know, and the cliche, here's a\nthought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're gonna have like the human executive team, and then we're gonna have the\ntheis be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of engineering\nsupervising 100 instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right by the way, or maybe the VP of\nengineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs, right? 'Cause one of the things that\nAI should be pretty good at is managing 'cause it's\nlike not, you know, it's like a process-driven,\nit's the kind of thing that AI's actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so should it be an AI executive team? You know, and then, of\ncourse, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, right? You know, and then maybe\nthe most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set\none of these things loose and let it basically\nbuild itself a business? And so I will say like\nwe're not yet seeing those, and I think there's a little bit of, the systems aren't quite\nready for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, like a founder who's really willing to break all the rules and\nreally willing to take the swing. And those people exist, and\nso I'm sure we'll see that. - And some of it is, as you\nknow, with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have\na AI-first email client, seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail\nis really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google\ncan't do it, because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer\nthe entirety of the system. 'Cause feels like Google's\nperfectly positioned to do it. Same with like, you have\nPerplexity, which I love, like Google could technically\ntake on Perplexity and do it much better,\nbut they haven't, not yet. So it's fascinating why\nthat is for large companies. I mean that is an\nadvantage for little tech, they could be agile. - Yeah, that's right.\n- They can move fast. - Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can't-\n- Right. - This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in\n\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which is sometimes when big\ncompanies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too much glass. It would specifically, it would interfere with\ntheir existing customers and their existing businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly,\nthey shouldn't do that, right? And so they just get, this is Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they're well-run, not\nbecause they're poorly run. But they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing against\nthe existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Like every once in a while, one breaks the pattern\nand actually does it. But for the most part, like this is a very predictable\nform of human behavior, and this fundamentally\nis why startups exist. - It feels like 2025 is\nwhen the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. Like, it's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI. Who do you think wins the AI race? - I would say, I'm not gonna predict, I'm gonna say there's\nquestions all over the place. And then we have this\ncategory question we call the trillion-dollar\nquestion, which is like, literally depending on how it's answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there's like, I don't know, 5 or $6 trillion questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I'll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small models. Another is open models\nversus closed models. Another is whether you can\nuse synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political\ntrillion-dollar questions. You know, policy\nquestions, which, you know, the US and the EU have both\nbeen flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is\nabout to really succeed at. Yeah, and then there's\nprobably another, you know, half dozen big important\nquestions after that. And so these are all just\nlike, say, this is an industry that's in flux in a way\nthat I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious\nexample of the flux is you know, sitting here\nless than three years ago, sitting here in December of '22, we would've said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today,\nit's like, you know, there's at least six, you know, world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of\nthe most shocking things to me, is like, it turns out that once\nyou know that it's possible to build one incredibly\nsmart Turning-test-passing large language model,\nwhich was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it\nturns out within, you know, a year, you can have five more. There's also a money\ncomponent thing to it, which is to get the money\nto scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There's basically right now\nonly two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers\ngiving you the money, which you turn around and\nroundtrip back to them. Or, you know, foreign\nsovereigns, other, you know, country sovereign wealth\nfunds, which can be, you know, difficult in some\ncases, for companies to access. So there's maybe another\ntrillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here's one. So Sam Altman has been\npublic about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a nonprofit,\nbeing a for-profit. The way that is legally done is that, and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and and other legal entities, government entities,\nscrutinizes very carefully, 'cause the US takes foundation\nnonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so the way that historically, the way that you do it\nis you start a for-profit and then you raise money\nwith the for-profit to buy the assets of the\nnonprofit at fair market value. And, you know, the last\nfinancing round at OpenAI was, you know, 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the\nflip is going to happen, the for-profit has to\ngo raise $150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. You know, raising 150\nbillion is a challenge. So, you know, is that even possible? If that is possible, then\nOpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, you know, I don't know. And then, you know,\nobviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the\nmarket leader today, you know, there's big important questions there. You know, Microsoft has this\nkind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind, but you know, they're\nvery good at catching up. Amazon, you know, is\nprimarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. - And then there's the other questions, like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly,\nopen versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. And then test on compute\nwith chain of thought. They're all of that. And it's just fascinating. And these are, I think it's fair to say,\ntrillion-dollar questions. - Yeah, these are big, like\nlook, you know, it's like, okay, here's a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations, right? Like, so if you are trying to\nuse these tools creatively, you're thrilled because\nthey can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this\nincredible stuff, right? They're creative. The flip side of that is if\nyou need them to be correct, they can't be creative. And that's, you know,\nthe term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And you know, there have been,\nyou know, court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court\ncitations, case citations. The judge is like, \"Wait a\nminute, this doesn't exist.\" And the very next is, \"Did\nyou write this yourself?\" And the lawyer goes, \"Er-\" (laughs) - I mean that's why with Elon, with Grok-\n- Yes. - Looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? - Yeah, that's right. And my sense is this very\ncontentious topic at the industry, my sense is if to the extent that there is a domain in\nwhich there is a definitive and checkable provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to\ngenerate synthetic data. You should be able to do\nchain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do\nreinforcement learning, and you should be able\nto ultimately, you know, eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that's a trillion-dollar\nquestion right there as to whether that's true. But then there's question of like, okay, is that gonna work in\nthe more general domain? Like, so for example, one\npossibility is these things are gonna get truly superhuman\nlike math and coding. But at like discussing\nphilosophy, they're gonna just, they're basically as smart\nas they're ever gonna be. And they're gonna be kind of, you know, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they're already outta training data. Like they literally, if, you know, you talk to these people,\nlike literally the big models, the big models are like\nwithin a factor of 2X of consuming all the\nhuman-generated training data to the point that some of these big companies are\nliterally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean\nthat like you have to, if you want your model\nto better philosophy, you have to go hire like\na thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody gonna do that? And so, you know, maybe these things are\ntopping out in certain ways and they're gonna leap\nway ahead in other ways. And so anyway, so we just\ndon't, you know, this is... Actually, maybe my main\nmain conclusion is, anybody telling, you know, anybody telling you these\nbig sweeping conclusions, you know, this whole super, you know, all of these abstract\ngeneralized super intelligence AGI stuff like, you know, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like, that's to abstract like,\nit's gotta actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have\nto be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem\nright now with the, you know, the big models that are like\nreally good at coding and math, they're like actually very\nexpensive to run, you know, they're quite slow. Another trillion-dollar\nquestion, future chips, which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean, all the global issue. Oh, another trillion-dollar\nquestion censorship, right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly, what are you\ntraining these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long did they give you these... How often do they give you these incredibly preaching moral lectures? Here's a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries\nwant their country to run its education system,\nhealthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing\nCalifornia politics, right? 'Cause that's kind of what\nthey have on offer right now. And I think the answer\nto that is not very many. So there's like massive\nopen questions there about like what, you know, and by\nthe way, like what morality of these things are gonna\nget trained on as a- - And that one we're cracking wide open with what's been happening\nover the past few months. Censorship on every\nlevel of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to be expand\nthe Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. - So what I experienced,\nyou know, going back to how we started, what I\nexperienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at like large scale, and then the war on the crypto\nindustry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared\nintent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under\nthe same kind of censorship and control regime as\nsocial media and the banks. And I think this election\ntipped, in America, I think this election\ntipped us from a timeline in which things were going to\nget really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are gonna be quite good. But look, those same questions\nalso apply outside the US and you know, the EU is doing their thing, they're being extremely draconian and they're trying to lock in\na political censorship regime on AI right now that's so harsh that even American AI\ncompanies are not even willing to launch new products\nin the EU right now. Like, that's not gonna last, but like, what happens there, right? And what are the trade-offs? You know, what levels of censorship are American companies\ngonna have to sign up for if they wanna operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them,\n(laughs) so that they can't? So big questions. - Quick questions. So you're very active on X. A very unique character, flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a meme, I\ndon't remember it exactly, but that Elon posted\nsomething like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I\nthink, you know, doing the, I take a big step back and\nfuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside\nyour mind when you're tweeting? - To be clear, a reference from the comedy\nclassic \"Tropic Thunder.\" - \"Tropic Thunder,\" yeah. Legendary movie. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Any Zoomers listening\nto this who haven't seen that movie, go watch it immediately. - Yeah, there's nothing\noffensive about it. - Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise's greatest performance. (Lex laughing) So-\n- Yeah. - Yeah, no, look, I should\nstart by saying like, I'm not supposed to be\ntweeting at all, so- - Yeah.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So, but, you know. - So how do you approach that? Like how do you approach what to tweet? - I mean, I don't. I don't well enough. It's mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there's a glory to it and there's an issue with it,\nand the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global\ncommunication, you know, X in particular is, you know, the town square on all these,\nyou know, social issues, political issues, everything\nelse, current events. But I mean, look, there's\nno question of the format. The format of at least\nthe original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I was tweeted something. It turned out that it's\nstill politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news\nin each time zone in India for a single tweet. So like, the single tweet outta context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously, X now has the\nmiddle ground where they, you know, they now have\nthe longer form essays. And so, you know, probably\nthe most productive thing I can do is longer form things. - You're not gonna do it though, are you? - [Marc] I do, I do,\nfrom time-to-time. I do. - Sometimes.\n- I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean,\nlook, but, and yeah, and obviously, X is doing great. And then, like I said,\nlike Substack, you know, has become the center for a\nlot, you know, a lot of the, I think the best kind of,\nyou know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly\nintellectual content, you know, tons of current events\nstuff there as well. And then, yeah, so, and then there's a bunch\nof other, you know, a bunch of new systems\nthat are very exciting. So I think one of the\nthings we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive\nreinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen with that. And it's happened on X, but it's now gonna happen\non other platforms. And then the other is crypto's gonna come right back to life. And actually that's\nvery exciting, actually, that's worth noting is that's another\ntrillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal\neconomic system for that, right? 'Cause it's a programmable money, it's a very easy way\nto plug in and do that. And there's this transaction\nprocessing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto\nAI intersection, you know, is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was gonna be\nimpossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do. - Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite\nthings about Yann LeCun? (Marc laughing) I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree\non a lot of things, but I personally like\nvigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the\ngladiators go at it, and- - No, he's a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn't\nsay we're super close, but you know, casual friends. I worked with him at Meta, you know, he is the chief scientist\nat Meta for a long time and is still, you know, works with us. And obviously is a legendary\nfigure in the field and one of the main people\nresponsible for what's happening. My serious observation would be that it's the thing I keep,\nI've talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does\nis he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree\nwith this, he is the smartest and most credible critic\nof LLMs is the path for AI. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's not, you know, there's certain, I would say troll-like characters who are just like crapping everything. But like Yann has like very\ndeeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. And I actually, like,\nI try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,\nI try to have a mental model of like the two different\nsides of a serious argument. And so I've tried to like\ninternalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult 'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like\nthat could be a big problem. But like, we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the\nbullish people, you know, to really kind of test\ntheir level of knowledge. So I like to kind of grill people. Like, you know, I was got\nmy CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like to the extent I can\nunderstand Yann's points, I can use them to, you know,\nto really surface a lot of the questions for the\npeople who are more bullish. And that's been, I think,\nvery, very productive. Yeah, just, and it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, who is actually like a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he\nwill provoke the evolution of these systems to be much\nbetter than they would've been. - Yeah, he could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the\nLLM path to AGI, you know, his basic notions that\nthere needs AI needs to have some physical understanding\nof the physical world, and that's very difficult\nto achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations\nof LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source.\n- Yes. - Which is a whole nother-\n- Yes. - Which you have been as well. - [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah. - And that's been just\nfascinating to watch. - [Marc] And anti-doomer. - Anti-doomer?\n- Yeah. - Yeah, he's-\n- He's very anti-doomer. - He embodies... He also has many wolves inside. - [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes, he does. Yes, does. - So it's been really,\nreally fun to watch. - The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. - [Lex] Yeah. - The other two of the\nthree godfathers of AI are like radicals, like full-on left, you know,\nfar left, you know, like, I would say like either\nMarxists or borderline Marxists. And they're like, I think, quite extreme in\ntheir social political views. And I think that feeds\ninto their doomerism, and I think, you know, they are lobbying for\nlike draconian government, I think what would be ruinously\ndestructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Yann as a\ncounterpoint to those two. - Another fun question, our\nmutual friend Andrew Huberman. - [Marc] Yes. - First maybe, what do you\nlove most about Andrew? And second, what score\non a scale of 1 to 10 do you think he would give you\non your approach to health? - Oh, three. - Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.\n- (laughs) Exactly. - That's good. (laughs)\n- Exactly. Well, so he convinced me\nto stop drinking alcohol, which was a big-\n- Successfully? - Well, it was like other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world.\n- Yeah. - And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night, it was like a major, like, it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly\nnegatively impacted my emotional health. (Lex laughing) I blame him-\n- Yeah. - For making me much\nless happy as a person. But much, much, much healthier. - Yeah.\n- Physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have no interest in\nhis sleep shit. Like, no. This whole light, natural light, no, we're not doing it. - You're too hardcore for this? - I don't see any natural light in here. - [Lex] It's all covered. It's all horrible. - And I'm very happy. I would be very happy\nliving and working here 'cause I'm totally happy\nwithout natural light. - In darkness.\n- Yes. - It must be a metaphor for something. - Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have\na blue screen in your face for three hours and\nthen go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why you should wanna take shortcuts. - I now understand what they\nmean by toxic masculinity. All right. (both laughing) So let's see. You're exceptionally\nsuccessful by most measures, but what to you is the\ndefinition of success? - I would probably say it is\na combination of two things, I think it is contribution. So, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately, you know, and specifically\nit mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not\nmean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said, \"Pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to\nsatisfaction or fulfillment. And so I think about happiness as the first ice cream\ncone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice\ncream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of\nthe walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Right, and so happiness is\nthis very fleeting concept, and the people who\nanchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I dunno how to put it useful. - So that's a good place\nto arrive at in life. - Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah. You know, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But like, if you're sitting in a room by yourself and you're like, all right. Or you know, four in the\nmorning, it's like, all right, have I lived up to my\nexpectation of myself? Like if you have, you know,\nthe people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and, you know, generally seem\nvery, I dunno how to put it, pleased with, you know,\nproud, calm, at peace. The people who are, you\nknow, sensation seekers, you know, some of the sensations\nby the way, some sense, you know, there's certain\nentrepreneurs, for example, who are like into every\nform of extreme sport and they get, you know, huge\nsatisfaction out of that. Or, you know, there's sensation seeking in sort of useful and productive ways. You know, Larry Ellison\nwas always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, there's\na lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know,\ndrugs, (laughs) you know, like you know, sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun\nat first and then backfire. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM- - [Marc] Yeah.\n- And I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM- - Yeah.\n- With a blue screen. - That's good. Exactly. - Staring at cursor.\n- Exactly. - As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an\namazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and\njust to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called,\n\"Honestly, with Bari Weiss.\" She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys... See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. - [Marc] Thank you. - So this question is designed for many of the questions today\nwere designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause\nthat you're not sure. So it felt like the\npause, the uncertainty, there was some kind of\nongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching\nfor wisdom and meaning? - I guess I'd put it this way. There's a lot to just\nunderstand about people that I feel like I'm only\nstarting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler\nconcept than God. (laughs) So that's what I've spent a\nlot of the last, you know, 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my\nfirst like whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I'm spending 30\nyears figuring out people, which turns out to be quite\na bit more complicated. And then, I don't know,\nmaybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look,\nI mean just, you know, like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is like\nvery, you know, complicated and, you know, mystifying. I mean, every time I, you\nknow, pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, you know, \"Daddy, how many galaxies\nare there in the universe?\" And you know, how many galaxies are\nthere in the universe? - 100 billion?\n- Okay. Like how? (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - Like-\n- Yeah. - Like how that freaking possible? Like it's such a\nstaggering concept that I- - I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from\nElon from a while back. Elon, said, \"As a friend called it, this\nis the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies, a billion light years across.\"\n- Yeah. - So these are all galaxies.\n- Yeah. Like how was it that big? Like how the hell, and like, you know, I can read the textbook\nand the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion\nyears and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all\nrights, the Big Bang. All right, like what was\nbefore the Big Bang? (laughs) - Do you think we humans will\never colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? - Sure. Yeah, I mean,\nin the fullness of time. Yeah. - So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across a thousand of-\n- In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah, you know, all the problem, all the\nchallenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it'll take a long time. - You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? - No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately\nwe have Elon giving us, (Lex laughing) giving us the backup plan. So I don't know, like,\nI grew up, you know, real Midwest, sort of\njust like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an\nengineer and a scientist. I'm like, \"Oh, that definitely\ndoesn't make sense.\" I'm like, \"I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll figure everything out.\" And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against\nthese things, you know, you bump up against these things and you're just like, \"All right,\" I like, \"Okay, I guess there's\na scientific explanation for this, but like, wow.\" And then there's like, \"All right, where did that come from?\" Right, and then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean,\nand even just, you know, experiences that we all have on earth, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, I guess I just say I'm kind\nof radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that\nI'll probably never know. The other thing though, that's happened, and maybe the more practical\nanswer to the question is I think I have a much\nbetter understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great... I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, \"If a man does\nnot have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\" And so there's this class,\nit's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing\npoint of view, which is, \"Yes, I'm an atheist,\nbut it's very important that the people believe in something.\" Right? And Marx had like the\nnegative view on that, which is religions the\nopiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like\nright-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it's deeply important that the people be Christian\nor something like that. And on the one hand it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right because, you know, what have we learned in the last 100 years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's\nthis political philosopher who's super interesting on\nthis named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the sort\nof mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was like born in, I think, like 1900, and like died in like '85. So he saw the complete run\nof communism and Nazism and himself, you know, I think he fled Europe and\nyou know, the whole thing. And you know, his sort of\nbig conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but like in the deep way of religions. Like, you know, we call\n'em political religions, but they were like actual religions. And you know, they were\nwhat Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, \"God is dead. We've killed him, and we won't\nwash the blood off our hands for 1,000 years,\" right? Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just\nmass murder and death. And like, you read his stuff now and you're like, \"Yep,\n(laughs) that happened.\" Right? And then, of\ncourse, as fully, you know, elite moderates, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing\nthat for ourselves right now, but of course, we are. And you know, I would argue\nthat Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the\nlast 10 years, you know, we have been in a\nreligious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full\nscale religious frenzy and has had all of the\ncharacteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to, you know, sin. Wokeness has said, every, I think, has said every single aspect of an actual religion other\nthan redemption, right? Which is maybe like the\nmost dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's\nno forgiveness, right? And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would've\nzeroed right in on that, would've said that. And, you know, we just\nlike sailed right off. I mentioned earlier like\nwe somehow rediscovered the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity\npolitics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, like there is\nsomething very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and\nneeds to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles\nwith the specifics of it. - I think I speak for a lot of people that it's been a real joy and for me, an honor to get to\nwatch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You're in that 30-year part of your life, and it's been an honor\nto talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That's only, how long is that? - Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so- - I'll accept being one of the short ones. (both laughing) - For the listener. Marc looks like he's ready\nto go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. (laughs) Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen.

And then if this doesn't\nget fixed, at some point, we enter a hyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil and- - The following is a conversation\nwith Marc Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. Marc is a visionary\ntech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the\ntech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential\nvoices in the tech world, including at the intersection\nof technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the\nbest possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small\ntech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario\ntrajectory for America. - The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.\n- The roaring '20s. I mean, look, couple things. It is remarkable over\nthe last several years with all of the issues\nincluding, you know, not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every\nother thing that's happened. It's really amazing, the United\nStates just kept growing. If you just look at\neconomic growth charts, the US just kept growing,\nand very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing,\nGermany has stopped growing, and you know, some of those countries may be actually growing\nbackwards at this point. And there's a very long\ndiscussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's of course, plenty of things that are\nwrong with our country, but the US is just flat\nout primed for growth. And I think that's a consequence\nof many factors, you know, some of which are lucky and\nsome of which through hard work. And so the lucky part is\njust, you know, number one, you know, we just have like\nincredible physical security by being our own continent. You know, we have incredible\nnatural resources, right? There's this running joke now that like, whenever it looks like\nthe US is gonna run out of some like rare earth\nmaterial, you know, some farmer in North Dakota\nlike kicks over a hay bale and finds like a $2 trillion deposit. Right, I mean, we're just like blessed, you know, with geography\nand with natural resources. Energy. You know, we can be energy\nindependent anytime we want. This last administration\ndecided they didn't wanna be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has\ndeclared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There's no question we\ncan be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It's purely a question of choice, and I think the new\nadministration's gonna do that. And oh, and then I would\nsay two other things. One is, you know, we\nare the beneficiaries, and, you know, you're an example of this. We're a beneficiary. We're the beneficiary of,\nyou know, 50, 100, 200 years of like the basically\nmost aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people, you know, moving to the US and\nraising their kids here. And so we just have, you know, we're by far the\nmost dynamic population, most aggressive. You know, we're the most\naggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country, and have been for a long\ntime, and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the\nadvanced technology leader. You know, we have our\nissues and we have a... I would say particular\nissue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for, you know, anything\nin software, anything in AI, anything in, you know,\nall these, you know, advanced biotech, all these\nadvanced areas of technology, like we're by far the leader. Again, in part 'cause many\nof the best scientists and engineers in those fields, you know, come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for a just a monster boom. You know, I could see\neconomic growth going way up. I could see productivity\ngrowth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a\nglobal tour, if you like, but like, basically, all of our competitors\nhave like profound issues and, you know, we could kind\nof go through them one by one, but the competitive\nlandscape just is, it's like, it's remarkable how much better positioned\nwe are for growth. - What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical questions. You know, I travel across the world and there's something\nabout the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be\nthe Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? - Yeah. So is this a family\nshow or am I allowed to swear? - You could say whatever\nthe fuck you want. - (laughs) Okay. So the great TV show, \"Succession,\" the show, of course, which\nyou were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.\n- Yes. - The best line from \"Succession\"\nwas in the final episode of the first season\nwhen the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral\nhomeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle,\nyou know, for some wedding. And Logan is just like\ncompletely miserable, have to having to, you know, 'cause he is been in\nNew York for 50 years, he's totally miserable\nbeing back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here and go back to America where\nwe can fuck without condoms.\" (both laughing) - Was that a metaphor or... Okay.\n- Exactly. Right. And so no, but it's exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what, like-\n- Yeah. - Everybody watching that\ninstantly starts laughing 'cause you know what it means,\nwhich it's exactly this. I think there's like an\nethnographic, you know, way of it. There's a bunch of\nbooks on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all\nthe different derivations of all the different ethnic\ngroups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. Right, and what we have is\nthis sort of amalgamation of like, you know, the\nNortheast, you know, Yankees who are like super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are\nsuper aggressive, you know, we've got the, you know, the Southerners and the Texans, you know, and you know, the sort of, you\nknow, whole kind of blended, you know, kind of\nAnglo-Hispanic thing, you know, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, you know, capable characters. You know, the Texas Rangers,\nyou know, we've got the, yeah, we've got the California, you\nknow, we've got the, you know, the wild, we've got the\nincredibly, you know, inventive hippies, but we also\nhave the hardcore engineers. We've got, you know, the best, you know, rocket scientists in the world. We've got the best, you\nknow, artists in the world, you know, creative professionals,\nyou know, the best movies. And so yeah, there is, you know, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, you\nknow, in my view to some extent, you know, attempts to\nbasically sand all that off and make everything basically\nboring and mediocre. But there is something\nin the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just\nneed people to stand up at a certain point and say, you know, \"It's time to build, it's time to grow, you know,\nit's time to do things.\" And there's something\nin the American spirit that just like roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I actually saw, you know, I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s, you know, 'cause the '70s were like horribly depressing, right? In the US. Like they were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has\nfelt a lot like the '70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating,\nyou know, negative attitude and everybody's upset about everything. And, you know, and then by\nthe way, like energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization, right? You know, the low point for\nin the '70s was, you know, Jimmy Carter who just passed away. He went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech. And it was like the weakest possible, trying to like rouse people\nback to a sense of like passion, he completely failed. And, you\nknow, we had the, you know, the hostages in, you know,\nIran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly\nnews, it was, you know, lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then, you know, Reagan came in and, you know, Reagan was a\nvery controversial character at the time, and, you know, he came in\nand he is like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're gonna do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and, you know, roared really\nhard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what... I think, you know, we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. - And I just did a super long\npodcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible\nprofessor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic.\n- Yes. - And one of which maybe\nyou can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual\nfreedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just\nin general, individualism. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and as you know this, America has this incredible\nstreak of individualism, you know, individualism in\nAmerica probably peaked, I think between roughly call\nit the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably\ncall it 1931 or something, you know, and there was\nthis like incredible rush. I mean, that period, you know, we now know that period as the\nSecond Industrial Revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then, you know, that led to, you know, ultimately then therefore\nbeing able to, you know, not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II\nand then win the Cold War. And yeah, you know, massive\nindividualistic streak. By the way, you know,\nMilton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring.\n- Yep. - As they were then, you know, he is a singular figure and many of us, you\nknow, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of\npeople who worked with him and you know, he was a singular figure, but all of his lessons, you know, live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's\nnot just individualism, and this is, you know, this\nis one of the big things, it's like playing out\nin a lot of our culture and kind of political fights\nright now, which is, you know, basically this feeling, you\nknow, certainly that I have and I share with a lot\nof people, which is, it's not enough for America\nto just be an economic zone. And it's not enough for\nus to just be individuals, and it's not enough to\njust have line go up, and it's not enough to\njust have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also, you know,\nthere's more to a country than just that. And you know, quite frankly,\na lot of it is intangible. A lot of it is, you know,\ninvolve spirit and passion. And you know, like I said, we have more of it than\nanybody else, but, you know, we have to choose to want it. The way I look at, it's\nlike all of our problems are self-inflicted. Like, you know, decline is a choice. You know, all of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, you know, basically people telling us, people in positions of\nauthority telling us that, you know, \"We shouldn't,\nyou know, stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous,\nwe shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, you know, we shouldn't this,\nthat, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about\neverything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think\npeople are done with it. - If we could go on a\ntangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book \"The Ancient City.\"\n- Yes. - By, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa\nDenis Fustel de Coulanges, I don't know. - That was amazing. - Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said, this is an\nimportant book to understand who we are and where we come from. - So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by\nthis guy as a (indistinct). I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language\npronunciations for the day. He was a professor classics\nat the Sorbonne in Paris, you know, the top university,\nactually in the 1860s, so actually, right around\nafter the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a\nparticular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the\nbook as he had apparently read, and, you know, sort of absorbed and memorized every\npossible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about\nGreek and Roman culture, and that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none\nof that has changed, right? And so he had access to the\nexact same written materials that we have access to, and you know, we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he\ndid is he went back further. He reconstructed the people\nwho came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their\nlife and society was like. And these were the\npeople who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you\nmay have heard of these are the people who came\ndown from the steppes. And so they came out of what's\nnow like Eastern Europe, like around sort of the\noutskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of\nswept through Europe. They ultimately took over\nall of Europe, by the way, you know, almost many of the\nethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years\nthat follow, you know, are Indo-European. And so like, you know, they were this basically this warrior, basically class that like\ncame down and swept through and you know, essentially, you know, populated much of the world. And there's a whole\ninteresting saga there. But what he does, and then they basically, from there came basically\nwhat we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind\nof evolutions off of that. And so what he reconstructs\na sort of what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind\nof original social state. And the significance of that\nis the original social state is this is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no\ntechnology, (laughs) right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got the clothes on your back, you've got your, you know, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you know, predates\nbasically all concepts of technologies as we\nunderstand 'em today. And so these are people\nunder like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social\npatterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern\nbasically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero\nconcept of individual rights and essentially no\nconcept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set\nof tribes would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what\nNietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality,\nanything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it's very clear why that is, right? It's 'cause strong equals\ngood equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is it more important\nfor you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, you know, live as a slave on your\nknees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted\nthat moral framework. But it, you know, the\noriginal framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally\nobligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. (laughs) Right, you were morally required to. Like, if you didn't do\nit, you were a bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time\nwith no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives\nis that it's a collective you know, and people are\nsharing and of course, that limited how big they could get 'cause you know, the\nproblem with communism is it doesn't scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it\nwork at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately\ntied into their religion. And their religion was,\nit was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors\nis extremely important because it was basically the\nancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the\npeople who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of nature 'cause of course, nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city\nhad their ancestor gods, and then they had their nature gods. Okay, so fast-forward to today, like we live in a world that\nis like radically different, and the book takes you\nthrough kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans, through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because\nthe conventional view of the progress through time\nis that we are, you know, the cliche is the arc of the\nmoral universe, you know, bend towards justice, right? Or so-called wig history,\nwhich is, you know, that the arc of progress\nis positive, right? And so, you know, what\nyou hear all the time, what you're taught in school\nand everything is, you know, every year that goes by,\nwe get better and better and more and more moral\nand more and more pure and a better version of ourselves, our Indo-European ancestors would say, \"Oh, no, like you people\nhave like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically your civilization, and you have diluted\nthem down to the point where they barely even matter. You know, and you're having, you know, children outta a wedlock and you're, you know, you\nregularly encounter people of other cities and you\ndon't try to kill them.\" And like, how crazy is that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an\nincredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious,\nhighly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can't resist noting\nthat as a consequence of basically going through\nall the transitions we've been through, going all the way through\nChristianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We're in a secular society,\nyou know, that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but you know, largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved,\nmodern secular, you know, expert, scientists and so\nforth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact\nsame religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had,\nspecifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics\nand nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, worked our way all the way\nback to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show\nthat like, you know, in some ways we have fallen\nfar from the family tree, but in some cases, we're exactly the same. - You kind of described this\nprogressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. - Identity politics is\nworshiping ancestors, right?\n- Yeah. - It's tagging newborn\ninfants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've\nrecognized it on sight. We somehow think it's like\nsuper socially progressive. - Yeah. And it is not. - I mean, I would say obviously not. You know, get nuanced, which\nis where I think you're headed, which is look like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent\nsociety every generation, and have no regard whatsoever\nfor what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea, right? That's like the Cambodians\nwith Year Zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up\neverything that came before and create something new\nin the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing, you know,\nenormous destruction. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, there is like a deeply\nimportant role for tradition. And the way I think\nabout that is the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And you know, this is what\nIndo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled\nwisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and\npowerful lessons learned. And that's why I think\nit's fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is 'cause that's part of the history and you know, part of the learning that got us to where we're today. Having said that, there are\nmany cultures around the world that are, you know, mired\nin tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that's the default human\ncondition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in\nsocieties in which, you know, there's like absolute\nseniority by age, you know, kids are completely... You know, like in the\nUS, like for some reason, we decided kids are in\ncharge of everything, right? And like, you know,\nthey're the trendsetters and they're allowed to\nlike, set all the agendas and like set all the politics\nand set all the culture and maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. 'Cause it's the old\npeople who are in charge of everything, you know,\nthey're gerontocracies, and it's all a bunch of\n80-year-olds running everything, which by the way, we have a\nlittle bit of that too, right? And so what I would say is like, there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is\ncommunitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you\nknow, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, I mean, it just\ndoesn't get you anywhere. Like, it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a society living\nin the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in\nall the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, you know, I think it probably, this is one of those things\nwhere extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. - So the beautiful picture you\npainted of the roaring '20s, how can the Trump\nadministration play a part in making that future happen? - Yeah, so look, a big part of this is getting the government\nboot off the neck of the American economy, the\nAmerican technology industry, the American people. You know, and again, this\nis a replay of what happened in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know, for what started out looking\nlike, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you\nknow, we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I describe as sort of a\nform of soft authoritarianism. You know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's not like, you know, you\nget thrown into Lubyanka. You know, for the most part, it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know,\nincredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vetocracy, right? What's required to get anything done? You know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything,\nany one of them can veto it. You know, there's a lot of (indistinct)\npolitical system works. And then, you know, just this\ngeneral idea of, you know, progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses\nis bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome,\nyou know, basically anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. Anybody who's wrong\nabout anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this\nvery kind of, you know, grinding repression. And then coupled with\nspecific government actions such as censorship regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, you know, critical American industries and then, you know,\ncongratulating yourselves on the back for doing it, or, you know, having these\nhorrible social policies, like let's let all the\ncriminals outta jail and see what happens, right? And so, like we've just\nbeen through this period, you know, I call it a\ndemoralization campaign. Like we've just been through\nthis period where, you know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being\nthis comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible\nand if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration\nreached kinda the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many\nfronts at the same time. And so just like relieving that and getting kind of back\nto a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic,\nconstructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind,\nthere's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is gonna, I think,\ncause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of\nthings proactively that, yeah. And then there's a lot\nof things proactively that could be done. - So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically\npermeated government and permeated big companies? - Disclaimer at first, which is I don't wanna predict\nanything on any of this stuff 'cause I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics\nor Washington at all. But I would just say that\nthe plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration\nand that they plan to take, you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're gonna do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they're gonna do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they're gonna move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. Like, I mean, you know, we just saw a great example\nof this with what, you know, with what Mark Zuckerberg\nis doing, you know, and obviously I'm\ninvolved with his company, but you know, we just saw it\nkind of in public, the scope, and speed of the changes, you know, are reflective of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry, right? And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump\nor anti-Trump, like, there's just like a giant vibe shift mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a\ngroup of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still, you know, people who at least vocally\nwere still very anti-Trump, but I said, you know, \"Has anything changed since November 6th?\" And they immediately said, \"Oh, it's completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. You know, woke is over.\" You know, they said that\nall kinds of projects are gonna be able to get\nmade now they couldn't before that, you know, Hollywood's gonna start\nmaking comedies again. You know, like, they were just, just like an incredible\nimmediate environmental change. And as I talk to people kind\nof throughout, you know, certainly throughout the economy,\npeople who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which\nis just this last 10 years of misery is just over. I mean, the one that I'm\nwatching that's really funny. I mean, Facebook's getting a lot, Meta's getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is\nBlackRock, which I'm not, you know, and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so, you know, the Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock was like first in as a major, you know, investment CEO on like\nevery dumb social trend and rule set, like every... All right, I'm going for it.\nEvery retardant, (laughs) every retarded thing you can imagine.\n- Yeah. - Every ESG and every, like, every possible saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed\nideological positions. And, you know, he was coming\nin, he literally was like, had a aggregated together\ntrillions of dollars of shareholdings that he did not, you know, that were his customer's rights. And he, you know, seized\ntheir voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been like backpedaling\nfrom that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example, last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, you know, he pulled out\nof the crazy energy stuff. And so, like, you know, he's\nbacking away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard\nPryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where\nhe could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (Lex laughing) (laughs) And so, you know,\neven there doing that, and just the whole thing, I mean this, I dunno if you saw the court\nrecently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of\ndirectors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel\nand I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional\nattorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight\nface that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who\nliterally wrote a book called \"The Diversity Myth.\"\n- Yeah. - And he literally looked\nlike he'd swallowed a live goldfish and that-\n- Yeah. - And this was imposed, I mean, this was like so\nincredibly offensive to him that like, it was just\nabsolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (Lex laughing) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange\nimposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that, you know, so like these things basically are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other\nside of it is basically, you know, finally being able\nto get back to, you know, everything that, you know,\neverybody always wanted to do, which is like, run their\ncompanies, have great products, have happy customers,\nyou know, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society. - It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. - Well, so it was very, you\nknow, there was a moment. So you know, Peter, of course, you know, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but you know, there are other\nmen on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it,\nand we're like, all right, like, okay, LGBT, and we keep\ncoming back to the B, right? And it's like- (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - You know, it's like-\n- All right. - You know, I'm willing to do\na lot for this company, but- (both laughing) - It's all about sacrifice for diversity. - Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay,\nlike is there a test? - Right.\n- Right. You know, so.\n(Lex laughing) - Oh, yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? - [Marc] The questions\nthat got asked, you know. - What are you willing to do-\n- Yeah, and- - The greater good? - I've become very good at asking lawyers\ncompletely absurd questions with a totally straight face. - And do they answer with a\nstraight face, like lawyers- - Sometimes.\n- Okay. - I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. - So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon\nValley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to\npreference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? Like what percent of them\nare feeling this vibe shift and are interested in\ncreating the roaring '20s in the way they've described? - So first, we should\nmaybe talk population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley and the way to just measure that is just look at\nvoting records, right? And what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically, my entire time there has\nbeen overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that\nis political donation records. And again, you know,\nthe political donations in the Valley, you know,\nrange from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. And so, you know, I just\nbring it up 'cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there\nis a very big question of what's happening in\nLos Angeles right now. I don't wanna get into the fire, but like, it's catastrophic. And, you know, there was\nalready a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people\nin LA are really thinking about things right now as\nthey're trying to, you know, literally save their houses\nand save their families. But, you know, even in San Francisco, you know, there was a big shift\nto the right in the voting in '24. So, we'll see where\nthat goes, but you know, you observe that by just looking\nat the numbers over time. The part that I'm more\nfocused on is, you know, and I don't know how to\nexactly describe this, but it's like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people, right? You know, and I don't have a list, but like, you know, it's\nall the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top\nengineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, you know, the people who kind of\nbuilt and run the companies. And they're, you know,\nI don't have numbers, but I have a much more\ntactile feel, you know, for what's happening. So the big thing I have\nnow come to believe is that the idea that people\nhave beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most\nhigh-status people just go along. And I think maybe the\nmost high-status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the\nmost focused on status. And the way I would\ndescribe that is, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the\nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely\ninteresting articulation. You know, he was an\ninsane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. (both laughing) But-\n- Shots fired, man. - But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing\nwhere he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that's just stuck in my\nmind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept, you just called over-socialization. And so, you know, most\npeople are socialized, like most people are, you\nknow, we live in a society, most people learn how\nto be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There's something about\nmodern Western elites where they're over-socialized and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, you know, think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little\nbit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence\nof where I grew up. Like even before I had the\nviews that I have today, there was always just this\nweird thing where it's like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree\non every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in The New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? (laughs) Right? But why does everybody like\nsnap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I\ncame to Silicon Valley, and it's just as true\ntoday 30 years later. And so I think most\npeople are just literally, I think they're taking their cues from, it's some combination of\nthe press, the universities, the big foundations. So basically, it's like\nThe New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and you know, I don't\nknow, you know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and you know, maybe the President if\nyour party is in power. And like, whatever that is, everybody who's sort of\ngood and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the\ntwo interesting things about that is, number one, there's no divergence among\nthe organs of power, right? So Harvard and Yale believed\nthe exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believed the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and\nthe Rockefeller Foundation believed the exact same thing. Google, and, you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believed the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there's never conflict\nin the moment, right? And so, you know, The New York Times and The Washington Post\nagreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the\nspecifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically, we in the valley, we're\non the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood's\non the tail end of that, in the same way New York's\non the tail end of that, the same way the media's\non the tail end of that. It's like some sort of\ncollective hive mind thing. And I just go through that to say like, I don't think most people in my orbit, or you know, let's say the top\n10,000 people in the Valley, or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're sitting\nthere thinking basically, I have rocks... I mean, they probably think\nthey have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core\nof rocks solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch\nreality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they\nconform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time, they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd. - Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that, there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking to\npeople really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens\nat the dinner parties? Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four\npeople who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the\nmind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention\nwithin New York Times with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that\novertook Marc Andreessen's face. - So look, I'll just\ntell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences,\nno, there's none of that. What there is that all of the\nheretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation is either\ndiscussed a one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real-life social network. There's a secret handshake,\nwhich is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like\nknow each other a little bit, but like not well. And like you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to\nthe other person openly or whether you have to\nlike be fully conformist. It's a joke. - Well, yeah, humor- - [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke.\n- Yep. - If the other person laughs,\nthe conversation is on. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - If the other person doesn't laugh, back slowly away from the scene, (laughs) I didn't mean anything by it. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then by the way, it\ndoesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke\nthat's just up against the edge of one of the, use the\nSam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. You know, it has to be up\nagainst one of the things, you know, one of the things\nthat you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point,\nwhat happens is you have a peer-to-peer network, right? You have a one-to-one\nconnection with somebody, and then you have your own, your little conspiracy\nof a thought criminality, and then you've probably\nbeen through this, you have your network\nof thought criminals, and then they have their\nnetwork of thought criminals, and then you have this\nlike delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together, right? - And the fundamental mechanism\nof the dance is humor. - Yeah, it's humor like it, right? Well, of course.\n- Memes. Yeah. - Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor's a way\nto have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss\nserious thing without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right? So that's part of it, which is one of the reasons\nwhy comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can't. 'Cause, you know, they\ncan always fall back on, oh, yeah, I was just going for the laugh.\n- Yeah. - But the other key\nthing about humor, right? Is that laughter's involuntary, right? Like, you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision whether you're gonna laugh. And everybody can tell when\nsomebody's fake laughing, right? And this, every professional\ncomedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something truthful. Like, people don't laugh at\nlike, made-up bullshit stories. They laugh 'cause like\nyou're revealing something that they either have not\nbeen allowed to think about or have not been allowed\nto talk about, right? Or is off limits. And all of a sudden,\nit's like the ice breaks and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny and like I laugh, and then, of course,\nthis is why, of course, live comedy is so powerful is 'cause you're all doing\nthat at the same time, so you start to have, you\nknow, the safety of numbers. And so the comedians have like the all, it's no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has\nbeen as successful as he has 'cause they have this\nhack that the, you know, the rest of us who are\nnot professional comedians don't have, but you have\nyour in-person version of it. Yeah, and then you've got the question of whether you can sort of\njoin the networks together. And then you've probably\nbeen to this is, you know, then at some point\nthere's like a different, there's like the alt dinner party, the (indistinct) dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are like the happiest\nmoments of everybody's lives, 'cause they're just like,\neverybody's just ecstatic, 'cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed, like for every third sentence that comes outta my mouth, and we can actually\ntalk about real things. So that's the live version of it. And then, of course, the other\nside of it's the, you know, the group chat phenomenon, right? And then basically the same\nthing played out, you know, until Elon bought X and until\nSubstack took off, you know, which were really the\ntwo big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute\nconformity on the social networks, like literally enforced by\nthe social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through\ncancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming, right? But then group chats grew\nup to be the equivalent of samizdat, right? Anybody who grew up in the\nSoviet Union under, you know, communism, note, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It is like, how do you\nknow who you could talk to? And then how do you\ndistribute information? And like, you know, again, that was the hard\nauthoritarian version of this. And then we've been living\nthrough this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, with\nsome of the same patterns. - And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient\nto build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. - Yeah, exactly. Well,\nand this is the thing, and well, this is kind of the running joke about groups, right? The running kind of\nthing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, every group chat, if you've noticed this like, this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up\nbeing about memes and humor. And the game of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable. - [Lex] Yeah. - As you can get without\nactually tripping it, right? And like literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest\nwhere, but it's walking, they walk right up the line\nand they're constantly testing. And every once in a while\nsomebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, \"Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, we gotta wait until\nnext year to talk about that.\" You know, they walk it back. And so it's that same thing, and yeah. And then group chats is a\ntechnological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. 'Cause basically, it was number one, it was, you know, obviously\nthe rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of\nthe new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination\nof WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is\nthose were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough, I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably\nfour or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages,\nI think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of the\ndisappearing messages, right? And so it's like, you know, I\noften get behind on my thing, so I set to seven-day, you\nknow, disappearing messages and my friends who, you know, are like, no, that's way too much risk. - Yeah.\n- It's gotta be a day. And then every once in a\nwhile somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something\nlike particularly inflammatory. - Yeah, 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that\nbothers me about WhatsApp, the choices between 24 hours\nand, you know, seven days, one day or seven days.\n- (laughs) Right. - And I have to have an existential crisis about deciding.\n- Yes. - Whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Now, of course,\nwhat's happening right now is the big thaw, right? And so the vibe shift. So what's happening on the\nother side of the election is, you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the\ncontinued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new\nplatforms that are emerging. You know, like I think\nit may be, you know, I don't know that everything\njust shifts back into public, but like a tremendous amount\nof the verboten conversations, you know, can now shifts\nback into public view. And I mean, quite frankly,\nthis is one of those things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those, you know, what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like\nnet better for society that those things happen in\npublic instead of private. You know, do you really want, like, yeah. Like does she wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it's just, look, it's just I think,\nclearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. - I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea\nthat we're talking about. I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction\nof people have that? To me, the preference falsification\nis really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? 'Cause like that the dynamical system that is the difference between\nthose two is fascinating. Like, throughout history, the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting, 'cause everybody was following, you know, the line until not.\n- Right. - But for sure, privately,\nthere was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where like this is the\nbureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really\nbothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden, there's a trigger that allows\nthe vibe shift to happen. To me, like the interesting\nquestion here is, what is the landscape of\nprivate thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how\nmuch dormant energy is there for this roaring '20s? What people are like, no more\nbullshit, let's get shit done. - Yeah, so we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- - [Lex] Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly, this is one\nof the all-time great books. Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book, but it's completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply\nhistorically informed. So it's called \"Private\nTruths, Public Lies.\" And it's written by a social science\nprofessor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his\na definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls preference falsification. And so preference\nfalsification is two things, preference falsification... And you get it from the title of the book, \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So preference falsification\nis when you believe something and you can't say it, or/and this is very important,\nyou don't believe something and you must say it, right? And the commonality there is\nin both cases, you're lying. You believe something internally, and then you're lying about it in public. And so the thing, you know, and there's sort of the\ntwo classic forms of it. There's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe\ncommunism is rotten, but I can't say it version of it. But then there's also the famous parable of the real-life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good\nbook on this topic, which is \"The Power of the Powerless,\" you know, who is an\nanti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the, you know, the president Czechoslovakia\nafter the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book, and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of\nthe world unite, right? And so he describes what he calls the parable of the greengrocer, which is your greengrocer\nin Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been... 50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your story that says, \"Workers of\nthe world, unite,\" right? And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear\nthat the workers of the world are not going to unite. (laughs) Like of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been\nat that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be\nin your window every morning, because if it's not in\nyour window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are gonna come by and they're gonna get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays\nin the window all day long. But he says, the thing\nis, every single person, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the slogan knows that it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the store knows that the greengrocer is\nonly putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to\ngo through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the\nsystem and lying in public. And so it turns into\ndemoralization campaign. In fact, it's not ideological\nenforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake, everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're\nenforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they are\nenforcing compliance, right? And compliance with the regime. And fuck you, you will comply, right? And so anyway, that's\nthe other side of that. And of course, we have\nlived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening\nto this could name a series of slogans that\nwe've all been forced to chant for the last decade, that everybody knows at\nthis point are just like, simply not true. I'll let the audience, you know, speculate on their own group chats. (both laughing) - Send Marc your memes\nonline as well, please. - Yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so anyway, so it's the\ntwo sides of that, right? So it's \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending\nthat from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire\nsociety experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages\nquestion, which is like, okay, what happens in a society\nin which people are forced to lie in public about\nwhat they truly believe? What happens number one\nis that individually they're lying in public, and that's bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have\nan accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how\nmany people agree with them. And this is how you, and\nagain, this literally is like how you get something\nlike the communist system, which is like, okay, you\nend up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be\nwilling to go along with it, but I'm not gonna be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the people who agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a\nmovement, you're gonna get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're gonna win the revolution, right? And so the question of like\nwhat the percentage actually is like a really critical question. And then, basically, in any\nsort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know\nuntil you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put at\nthe test in the same way. This is exactly what's happened\nfor the last two years, like 100% of exactly what's happened. It's like straight outta this book, which is somebody, Elon,\nsticks his hand up (laughs) and says, \"The workers of the\nworld are not going to unite.\" - Yeah.\n- Right. Or the emperor is actually\nwearing no clothes, right? You know that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is\nstanding there by themselves, and everybody else in\nthe audience is like, \"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna\nhappen to that guy,\" right? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn't know, the\nfirst guy doesn't know, other people don't know, like,\nwhich way is this gonna go? And it may be that's a minority position and that's the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that's a majority position and you are now the\nleader of a revolution. And then basically, of\ncourse, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that\ndoesn't get killed, (laughs) the second guy does... Well, a lot of the time\nthat guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn't get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing, all right? Now, you've got two. Two leads to four, four leads\nto eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia\nand Eastern Europe in '89, when it goes, it can go, right? And then it rips. And then what happens\nis very, very quickly, if it turns out that you\nhad a large percentage of the population that actually believed\nthe different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, \"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority.\" And at that point, like you\nwere on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. Right, now. The other part of this is the distinction between the role of the\nelites and the masses. And here the best book is called \"The True Believer,\" which\nis the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this 'cause the elites do idea\nformation and communication. But the elites, by definition\nare a small minority. And so there's also this giant\nrole played by the masses, and the masses are not\nnecessarily thinking these things through in the same\nintellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure\nexperiencing these things in their daily lives,\nand they for sure have at least very strong\nemotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the\nelites lined up with, or either the current elites change or a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually\na different better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the, you know, to\nfollow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is\nalso happening right now. And again, case study\none of that would be Elon and you know, who turns out, you know, in truly massive following. - And he has done that over and over in different industries, not\njust saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit\nin the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. - Yeah. And it's like, well,\nbut then there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, and this is where, you know, there are many specific\nthings about Elon's genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit,\nbut in his mind it's true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else. He's not right all the time. But at least my through\nline with him both in what he says in public and\nwhat he says in private, which by the way are\nthe exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about\nwhat he believes in private, or at least he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's 100% consistent\nin my experience. By the way, there's two guys who are 100% consistent like that I know. Elon and Trump. (both laughing) - Yeah.\n- Whatever you think of them. - [Lex] Yeah. - What they say in\nprivate is 100% identical to what they say in public. Like, they're completely transparent, they're completely honest\nin that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful\nleaders of these movements, 'cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost\neveryone else actually believes, but nobody was actually\nwilling to say out loud. And so they can actually\ncatalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this\nframework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party, as I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind\nof conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one\nwho was saying them. And so the again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes, like we're\ngoing this other direction. That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual\nmechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me\nthat we have been living through exactly this. We've been living through\neverything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav\nHavel described, (laughs) you know, Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've been living\nthrough the, you know, the true believer elites\nmasses, you know, thing with, you know, with a set of like\nbasically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the loyalty masses anymore, and a set of new elites that\nare running away with things. And so like, we're living through this like\nincredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a\nmoral of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really\nbad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they\nhave to do, you know, to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. - So one of the ways to avoid\nthat in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between\nwhat's said in private and what's said in public small. - Yeah. It's like, well, this\nis sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep\npeople from saying things, which means we can keep\npeople from thinking things. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know, by the way, that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean,\nagain, the hard form, you know, Soviet Union\nowning a mimeograph, pre-photocopiers, there\nwere mimeograph machines that were used to make samizdat\nand underground newspapers, which is the mechanism\nof written communication of radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death, right? So that's the hard version, right? You know, the soft version\nis somebody clicks a button in Washington and you are\nerased from the internet, right? Like, which, you know, good\nnews, you're still alive. Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your\nfamily now, you know, they hates you and won't\ntalk to you, but you know, you know, whatever the version\nof cancellation has been. And so like, does that work? Like maybe it works for a while, like it worked for the\nSoviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially\nwhen it was coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like\nincredible speed and ferocity. 'Cause to your point, there's\nall this bottled up energy. Now, your question was like,\nwhat are the percentages? Like what's the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. It's like you've got 20%, like true believers in\nwhatever is, you know, the current thing, you know, you got 20% of people who are just like\ntrue believers of whatever they, you know, whatever's\nin the new, like I say, whatever's in The New York\nTimes, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation,\nlike they're just believe. And by the way, maybe\nit's 10, maybe it's five, but let's say generously it's 20. So you know, 20% kind of\nfull-on revolutionaries. And then you've got, let's\ncall it 20% on the other side that are like, \"No, I'm\nnot on board with this. This is crazy. I'm not signing up for this.\" But, you know, they view themselves as they're in a small minority, and in fact, they start\nout in a small minority, 'cause what happens is the\n60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people. And it's not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying\nto go to work each day and do a good job and be a good\nperson and raise their kids and, you know, have a little\nbit of time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, political activism or any of this stuff. It's just not their thing. But that's where the over\nsocialization comes in, it's just like, okay, by\ndefault, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the\nradical revolutionaries, at least for a while. And then the counter elite\nis in this other 20%. And over time, they build\nup a theory and network and ability to resist and a\nnew set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's\na contest and then, right? And then the question is,\nwhat happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kinda my point, it's not even really does\nthe 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like,\nokay, what is the thing that 60% now decides to\nbasically fall into step with? And I think that, in the valley, that 60% for the last\ndecade decided to be woke and, you know, extremely, I would say, (laughs) on\nedge on a lot of things. And you know, that 60%\nis pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it. - And I would love to\nsee where that pivot goes 'cause there's internal battles\nhappening right now, right? - So this is the other thing, okay, so there's two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is, he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you're gonna have\nis you're now gonna have people in the other direction. You're\ngonna have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't, (laughs) right?\n- Right. - So it's gonna swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's\nnot the only part of this, but you know, he's just a\nconvenient shorthand for, you know, for a lot of this. But, you know, whatever it is, you'll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, right? Or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled\nthat person, right? Where of course, they were\nfull on a part of the mob, like, you know, kind of at\nthat moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference\nfalsification happening in the other direction. And his prediction, I think,\nbasically is you'll end up with the same quote,\n\"problem\" on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. You know, how far is American\nsociety willing to go on any of these things? I don't know. But like, there is some question there. And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this, you\nknow, elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those\npeople are still in power and they're in very, you\nknow, important positions. And The New York Times is\nstill The New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard. And like, those people haven't\nchanged like at all, right? And bureaucrats in the governments and, you know, senior democratic, you know, politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there, you know, right now feeling like reality\nhas just smacked them hard in the face 'cause they\nlost the election so badly. But they're now going into a, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War, right? And that form of the Civil\nWar is completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize\n'cause we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half\nof them are saying, \"No, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak, we were too soft. You know, we must become\nmore revolutionary. We must double down and we\nmust, you know, celebrate, you know, murders in the street of health insurance executives.\" And that right now is like a real fight. - If I could tell you\na little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a\nhistorian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking\nabout having a podcast, on doing a podcast. And he eventually said that,\n\"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I\njust don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are\nthe particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would\nsurprise a lot of people if I said who it is. You know, this is a\nperson who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80-plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Okay? Nevertheless, he just\ndoesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just\nhave a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk\nto your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are\nfeeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts,\nhow quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you\nmentioned 20, 60, 20 matters and the contents of the\nprivate groups matters, and the dynamics of how\nthat shifts matters. 'Cause it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. There's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these\nnew vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold. - Yeah. So he's a friend of yours, I respect that you don't wanna name him. I also respect you\ndon't wanna beat on him, so I would like to beat\non him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? - Yes. He should use it. - So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate\nindictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart\nof our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it's, by the way, it's\nlike across the board, it's like all the top universities. It's like, 'cause the\nsiren song for right? What it's been for 70 years,\nwhatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure\nsystem, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an\nacademic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what\nyou actually think, right? Then you can do your\nwork and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these\npeople have done to it. Like it's gone, like that entire thing was\nfake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely, completely giving up the\nentire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually\n100% by taxpayer money. - What's the inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this,\nwhat can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? - That the population at large is gonna realize the\ncorruption in their industry and it's going to withdraw the funding? - (laughs) It's okay. So desperation. (laughs)\n- No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next.\nOkay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources\nof federal funding. The big one is a federal\nstudent loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of\ndollars at this point. And then only spiraling, you know, way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know\nthat when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as\nmuch as 70% of the money for central uses. - [Lex] Yeah. - Number three is tax exemption\nat the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit\ninstitutions as opposed to, let's say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close\nto a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources\nof federal taxpayer money, and then for the state\nschools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild, 'cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at University of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed\nand I'm cheering for them, but the problem is, you're now inserting. Suppose you and I wanna\nstart a new university and we wanna hire all the\nfree thinking professors, and we wanna have the\nplace that fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. I'll give you the most direct reason, we can't get access to that money, we can't get access to\nfederal student funding. Do you know how\nuniversities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They're not accredited by\nthe Department of Education. Instead, what happens is, the Department of Education\naccredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that\ndo the accreditation. Guess what the composition of\nthe accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to\nfederal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic\nthey are about accrediting a new university? Right, and so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone... I mean, it's just obvious now. It's just gone like sideways in basically any possible\nway it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting beaten\nup on campus for being, you know, the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every\npossible way at this point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these\nthings without replacing them. And there's no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's\nlike everything in life. I mean, in a sense, this is\nlike the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when\na company does a bad job, is they go bankrupt and another company\ntakes its place, right? And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that\nis what happens is this is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? 'Cause things are tested and tried, and then you, you know, the things that are good survive. And so these places\nhave cut themselves off. They've been allowed to cut\nthemselves off from both, from evolution at the institutional level and evolution of the\nindividual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable\nin their current form. - I disagree with you on that. Maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can\nrevolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford\nand MIT are important. - Oh, but that logic\ndoesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. - Underpants gnome, can you\nexplain what that means? - Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started\nwatching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is \"South Park.\" - Yes.\n- And there is- - Wow. - And there is a, which by the way is a little\naggressive for a nine-year-old. - Very aggressive. - But he likes it. So he's learning all kinds of new words. - And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. - I told him, I said, \"You're\ngonna hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\" - Right. (laughs) Education. - And I said, \"You know\nhow we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I said, \"Not using a word that you learn in here\ndoes not count as lying.\" - [Lex] Wow.\n- \"And keep that in mind.\" - This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. - And of course, in the\nvery opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls\nthe other kid a dildo. Right, we're off to the races. - Yep. Let's go. - \"Daddy, what's a dildo?\" - [Lex] Yep. (both laughing) - So, you know, \"Sorry son, I don't know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So the-\n- Underpants gnome. - So famous episode of \"South\nPark,\" the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat... All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing the underpants. And it's just like, well,\nwho on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it's\nthe underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants\ngnomes that come to town and they've got this\nlittle underground warrant of tunnels in storage places\nfor all the underpants. And so they go out at night,\nthey steal the underpants, and the kids discover that, you\nknow, the underpants gnomes, and they're, you know,\n\"What are you doing? Like what's the point of this?\" And so the underpants gnomes\npresent their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit.\n- Yeah. - [Marc] Step two, question mark. (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So you just proposed the underpants gnome-\n- Yeah. - Which is very common in politics. Oh, so the form of this in politics is we must do something.\n- Yeah. - This is something,\ntherefore we must do this. But there's no causal logic chain in there at all to expect\nthat's actually gonna succeed 'cause there's no reason to believe that it is.\n- Yeah, but- - And it's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the\nhost of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I hear this, I have friends\nwho are on these boards, right?\n- Yeah. - Very involved in these places, and I hear this all the\ntime, which is like, \"Oh, these are very important. We must fix them.\" And so therefore, they're fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. - If there's that pressure\nthat you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty primary, fire a lot of the administration and realign and reinvigorate\nthis idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't... Because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is\naligned with this very idea that you're talking about. It's this meaning like\nintellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface it's aligned, underneath it's become corrupted. - If we say free speech and\nacademic freedom, often enough, sooner or later, these tenured\nprofessors will get brave. - Wait, do you think the universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions\nfor educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit\nthat's outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create\ninstitution like that? - How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? - Right. You invent something new? - You open a new restaurant. - Yeah. - Like how often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that's just absolutely horrible, and it's poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you\ngo back and it's fantastic? Charlie Munger actually\nhad the best comment on, this great investor, Charlie Munger, has great comment. He was once asked, he's like,\nyou know, his, you know, General Electric was going\nthrough all these challenges and he was asked to do Q&A. It said, \"How would you fix the culture at General Electric?\" And he said, \"Fix the\nculture at General Electric?\" He said, \"I couldn't even fix\nthe culture at a restaurant.\" (Lex laughing) Like, it's insane. Like obviously you can't do it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nobody in business\nthinks you can do that. Like, it's impossible. Like it's not, now look, having said all that, I\nshould also express this 'cause I have a lot of friends\nwho work at these places and are involved in various\nattempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong, I\nwould love to be wrong. I would love for the\nunderpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how\nto do. I would love to fix it, I'd love to see them come back\nto their spoken principles, I think that'd be great. I'd love to see the professors\nwith tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I\nmean, it would be fantastic. You know, my partner and I have done like a lot of\npublic speaking on this topic, it's been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay,\nlike these challenges have to be confronted directly. By the way, let me also\nsay something positive. You know, especially post-October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart\npeople who are major donors and board members of these\ninstitutions like Marc Rowan, you know, who are really\ncoming in trying to, you know, I think legitimately\ntrying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He's working overtime to try to do this. Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question\nwould just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? - I'm a person that\nbelieves in leadership. If you have the right leadership- - [Marc] Right. - The whole system can be changed. - So here's a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? - You know how I think runs it? - [Marc] Yeah. - Whoever the fuck says they run it, that's what great leadership is. Like a president has that power.\n- But how does- - President of university has the leverage 'cause they can mouth off like Elon can. - Can they fire the professors? - They can fire them through\nbeing vocal publicly, yes. - Can they fire the professors? - What are you talking about legally? - [Marc] Can they fire- - No, they cannot fire the professors. - Then we know who runs the university. - The professors? - Yeah, professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they're, of course, in a radicalization\nfeedback cycle driving- - You said feral students?\n- The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows\nis that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them\nbecause they cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same\nthing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They cannot outlast you. I mean it's the whole thing\nthat, it's the resistance. Like they can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. - That's definitely a crisis\nthat needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that\nI'm defending academia here. I agree with you that\nthe situation is dire but I just think that\ninstitutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been\ngrilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation\nyou said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's- - I didn't say Dairy Queen\nis a great restaurant. - Let the listener take- - I said Dairy Queen\nis the best restaurant. - The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc\nAndreessen is saying today- - I don't wanna-\n- Put that into cont- - You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard.\n- Yeah. - They can get like\n4,000 calories in a cup. - They can and they're delicious. - [Marc] It's amazing. - They're truly delicious-\n- They're really fantastic. And they'll put anything in there you want.\n- All right- - Okay, so, but anyway, lemme just close by saying, look, my friends at the university\nsystem, I would just say, \"Look like, this is the challenge.\" Like I would just pose\nthis as the challenge. Like to me, like this is, having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation\nthat actually has to happen. This is the bar that\nactually has to be hit. These problems need to\nbe confronted directly, 'cause I think there's been way too much, I mean, I'm actually worried\nkinda on the other side, there's too much happy talk\nin these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers\ncome to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is\ngoing through, you know, no fault of any of ours,\nbut like the fuse is going and there's some window of time here to fix this and address\nit and justify the money 'cause it just, normal taxpayers sitting in\nnormal towns in normal jobs are not gonna tolerate\nthis for that much longer. - You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep\ninto the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to\nspeak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were\nthere when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of\ncensorship on social media. So take me to, through\nthat history, if you can, the use of censorship. - So I was there on the\nground floor in 1993. (both laughing) - There's multiple floors to\nthis building, apparently. - There are.\n- (laughs) Yeah. - So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. - That is fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. Actually, 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. - Did you have the courage to\nspeak up back then? (laughs) - I did not have any problems\nspeaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, you know, I\nwas legitimate, you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research\nproject actually funded by the federal government\nat a public university. So, you know, I don't\nthink my boss was like in any way outta line,\nbut it was like, yeah, like this web browser thing is great, but like could it just make\nsure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for\na second, as a technologist, I had a issue, which is this\nwas like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm (laughs) that I was going to have to design. And then apparently a variety of other, apparently body parts people are also sensitive about.\n- Yeah. - And then I politely declined to do this. - For just the technical\ndifficulties of it. - Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm a, you know,\nI'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days the internet\ngenerally was, you know, a free-fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting\nas sort of pre-'93, the internet was such a\nspecific niche community. Like, it was like the million\nkind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually like\ndidn't really have a lot of, you know, issues that people\nwere like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn't\nwanna start the process. So I think the way to think\nabout this, so first of all, you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I've been involved with\nthis at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007, so I've seen everything\nin the last, you know, almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I've been involved in most of the other companies over time, so I was an angel investor in Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover\nof Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we\nwere the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk\nspecifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you\nlike the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah, so basically the\nway to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that\ncan have zero censorship. And by the way, that also\nmirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited\nfree speech either. The US First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from\nthe Supreme Court over time. You know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're not\ncovered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are gonna\nstart an internet company and have a service, we can't\nhave that stuff either, right? 'Cause it's illegal or\nit will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always gonna\nhave a censorship engine. I mean, hopefully, it's not\nactually in the browser, but like you're gonna have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now\nyou have a machine right now. Now you have a system where\nyou can put in rules saying, we allow this, we don't allow that. You have enforcement, you\nhave consequences, right? And once that system is in place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now\nanybody in that company or anybody associated with that company, or anybody who wants to\npressure that company will just start to say, \"Okay,\nyou should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\" And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like\nvery, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided\nwith the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. You know, it's the kids that\nwere in school between like, you know, for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and like, they came out\nlike super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started\nmounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that\nthese companies were, you know, very subject to being controlled and the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors\nwere almost all Democrats and, you know, there's\ntremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from\nthe first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people\nand other, you know, law enforcement\nintelligence people came in and worked, and you know, they were all Democrats for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they, you know, picked it up and put it\non, and then they just ran. And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech\nconversation started exactly like you'd expect, which is,\nwe can't have the N-word. And which the answer is fair enough, let's not have the N-word. Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right? And Jordan Peterson has\ntalked a lot about this. The definition of hate\nspeech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, right? So we can't have things that make, you know, people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like me that are\ndisagreeable raise their hands and say, \"Well, that idea right there\nmakes me uncomfortable.\" But of course, that doesn't\ncount as hate speech, right? So, you know, the ring\nof power is on one hand and not on the other hand. And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently like\ncompletely anodyne comments that are completely\nlegitimate on television or on the Senate floor all\nof a sudden our hate speech can't be said online. So that, you know, the\nring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the\nstuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little\nbit of that early on, but of course, that really\nkicked in with Trump. So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by like three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence\nof the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you\nknow, a ring of power that was even more powerful, right? Because, you know, hate\nspeech, it's like, okay, at some point, if\nsomething offensive or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with\nmisinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, what do we know for 800 years or whatever Western civilization, it's that, you know,\nthere's only a few entities that can determine the\ntruth on every topic. You know, there's God, you\nknow, there's the king. We don't have those anymore and the rest of us are\nall imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any\ngroup of experts is gonna sit around the table and decide\non the truth is, you know, deeply anti-Western and\ndeeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation\nkind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax\ninto just full-blown, we're gonna use that weapon\nfor whatever we want. And then of course, then the\nculminating moment on that, that really was the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was we're gonna censor all theories that the COVID virus might\nhave been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies\nlike that was the point where people for the first\ntime, this is like what, three years ago for the\nfirst time they were like, and that was when it sunk in\nwhere it's just like, okay, this has spun completely outta control. But anyway, that's how\nwe got to where we are. And then basically that spell lasted that complex existed and\ngot expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and so when I am super\nproud of those guys, 'cause they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were gonna be\na free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And, you know, they\ntried to just beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by\nthe way, from, you know, let's say certain of the\nplatform companies, you know, basically threatening them.\nAnd they stood up to it. And, you know, sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum\nof speech and conversation, you know, anywhere on planet Earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way, it's great. And then obviously Elon, you\nknow, with X was the, you know, the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. - And there's also like singular moments, I think you've spoken about\nthis, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. - [Marc] Yes. - There's certain moments that just kinda shake\neverybody up, the right person, the right time, just it's a wake-up call. - So that there, and\nI will tell you, like, and I should say Jon Stewart\nattacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him, but I would say, I would say\nlong run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of \"The Daily Show\" when he was on it, you know, for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance\non the Colbert Show. And I don't know how\nbroadly this is, you know, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don't know how,\nif people remember this, but I will tell you in the\nrooms where people discuss what his misinformation and these policies, that\nwas a very big moment. That was probably actually\nthe key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I\nwould say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who\ndon't recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, like, you know, you absolutely\nmust lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep\nall the schools closed. You absolutely must have\neverybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a\nmask like the whole thing. And then one of those was,\nyou absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you're a fascist\nNazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person, right? And that was like uniform\nand that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don't know if\nthey planned it or not, 'cause Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much of it was a bit, but he went on there and\nhe just had one of these, like the Emperor's wearing no\nclosed things where he said, \"It's just not plausible that you had the COVID\nsuper virus appear 300 yards down the street from the\nWuhan Institute (laughs) of lethal coronaviruses.\" Like, it's just not plausible that certainly that you\ncould just rule that out. And then there was another\nkey moment, actually, the more serious version\nwas I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big\npiece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is like\none of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been like\nalt, you know, renegade, there had been, you know, people\nrunning around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was\nlike in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember let's say a board meeting at one of these companies after that, where basically, you know, everybody looked around\nthe table and was like, \"All right, like, I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore.\" And, you know, and then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \"Well, wait a minute, why were we censoring\nthat in the first place?\" And okay, like, and then, you know, the\ndownstream, not that day, but the downstream\nconversations were like, \"Okay, if we made such\na giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective\nmistake censoring that, then what does that say about\nthe rest of our regime?\" And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. - I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made\nwas a courageous act. - [Marc] Yeah, I agree. - I think we need to have\nmore of that in the world. And like you said, Elon,\neverything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg\ndid on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? - He has become, I think, an outstanding\ncommunicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for\na lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he's, you know,\nhe's one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And you know, as you do\nwith all of your episodes, like when somebody sit\nand talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody 'cause it's really hard to\nbe artificial for that long. And, you know, he's now\ndone that repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then, look, again, I would maybe put him in\nthe third category now with, certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put\nhim up there now with, you know, kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that. Like he said on that show\nwhat he really believes, he said all the same things\nthat he says in private. Like, I don't think there's\nreally any discrepancy anymore. I would say he has\nalways taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running\na company the size of Meta and to running services\nthat are that large. And I think, you know, his\nconception of what he's doing, which I think is correct,\nis he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. And then, you know, the\ncompany has, you know, many tens of thousands of\nemployees and many investors, and it's a public company,\nand he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so, you know, he has\nnot felt like he has had, let's just say, the complete\nflexibility that Elon has had. And, you know, people could\nargue that one way or the other, but, you know, he talked about a lot. He's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm gonna put\nmyself right back up there. Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this.\nLike, I've also learned a lot. Like, my views on things\nare very different than they were 10 years\nago on lots of topics. And so, you know, I've\nbeen on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as, or better\nthan anybody else I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show\nabout something very important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a set of decisions\nthat you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and\nso forth and it's valid, but you are under tremendous\nexternal pressure as well. And by the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've got your executives\nin some cases coming at you. You've got your board in\nsome cases coming at you. You've got your\nshareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire\nnonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you and, you know, that's\nthe really, you know, stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation\nof the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, then again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they\nclearly didn't wanna do and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I say, like I've known every CEO of Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the\njob, it was just daily beatings. Like it just getting punched in the face every single day, constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting (laughs) physically\npunched in the face, and then-\n- Getting better and better. Yeah. - You know, and he's very good\nat, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people\nto have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate\nwith like, I would say, extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in\nhis job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a\nlot about him that he has, you know, risen to this\noccasion the way that he has. And by the way, I should\nalso say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, you know, legitimate\nthing for people to say, but you know, it's like, \"Oh, you're only doing\nthis because of Trump, or, you know, whatever.\" And it's just like, no, like\nhe has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them\nout for a very long time. And so I think what\nyou saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the moment thing that could change at any time. - So what do you think it's like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal\npressure and external pressure? What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? - That's a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like, it's not a thing, right? And again, legitimately so, like CEOs get paid a lot,\nlike the whole thing. There's a lot of great things about it. So it's not like they\nshould be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that\nthey are human beings. And it is the case that\nit is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job is because your words\ncarry tremendous weight and you are dealing with\nextremely complicated issues, and you're under a tremendous\namount of emotional, you know, personal, emotional stress. And, you know, you often end\nup not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like, keep up an exercise routine\nand all those things. And you know, you come under family stress 'cause you're working all the time. Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO of our last company before\nwe started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life\nwas even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was like supposed\nto be like having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you get that a lot. But the key thing is like, you\ncan't talk to people, right? So I mean, you could talk to\nyour spouse and your kids, but like, they don't understand that they're networking in your company. They don't understand, have\nthe context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And they can't resist. Like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily\nrely on what they say. It's very hard in most\ncompanies to talk to your board because they can fire you. Now, Mark has the situation\n'cause he has control, it actually turns out he\ncan talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about\nmany things that he does that most CEOs won't talk\nto their boards about because we literally,\nbecause we can't fire him. But a general, including\nall the CEOs of Twitter, that none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the board members, they're gonna fire you, you\ncan't talk to the shareholders 'cause they'll just like\ndump your stock, right? Like, okay, so every once in a while, what you find is basically the\nbest-case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a\nlittle bit outta that. But even that's fraught with peril 'cause can you really talk\nabout confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it's just a very\nlonely isolating thing to start with. And then on top of that,\nyou apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal, external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand\nmost forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. - Hmm.\n- Right. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external\npressure you can withstand, and by that I mean\ninvestors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative article,\nyou know, negative headline and you know, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many\nof those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot withstand\nis the internal crack. And what I always look for in high-pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the\ninternal team cracks. Because I know the minute that happens, we're in a different regime. (laughs) Like, it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid. Like we're in a different regime and like the whole thing\ncan unravel in the next week 'cause then people turn, I mean this, I guess this is what's happening\nin Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire\nchief turned on each other, and that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get\nput back together again. It is over, it is not\ngoing to work ever again. And that's what happens\nto inside companies. And so somebody like Mark is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's been very good at\nmaintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,\na lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing\nI'd say, as I said, that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And especially, although not\nall one is government pressure. Is that when your\ngovernment comes for you? Like yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out\nof them in short order. - Can you just linger on that 'cause it is maybe educating\nand deeply disturbing? You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again\nthis government pressure. So you think they've crossed a line into essentially criminal\nlevels of pressure? - Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs) but yes, absolute criminality. - Can you explain how\nthose possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? - So I just start with\nis a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good 'cause it needs\nto be in the public record. And so there's three forms of things that are in the public record\nthat people can look at. So when is the Twitter Files,\nright, which Elon put out with the set of journalists\nwhen he took over. And I will just tell\nyou, the Twitter Files are 100% representative of what I've seen at every\nother one of these companies. And so you can just see\nwhat happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies,\nyou know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind\nof pressure that they got. So that's number one. That's stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven't. The second is Mark referenced\nthis in the Rogan podcast. There's a congressman Jim Jordan, who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, you\nknow, whatever three years have done a full-scale\ninvestigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have\nnow been made public and you can download those reports. And there's like 2,000 pages\nworth of material on that. And that's essentially\nthe Facebook version of the Twitter Files just arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself\ntalking about this on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just\ndefer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is\nbasically the government, you know, over time and then\nculminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years, just decided that the First\nAmendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that\nfederal laws around free speech and around conspiracies\nto take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure. They just like literally\narbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, you know, threaten repercussions and force them to censor. And you know, there's\nthis whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment\nonly applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't\napply to companies. It's like, well, there's actually a little\nbit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely\napplies to the government. Like 100%, the First Amendment\napplies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship\nregime that was put in place. There was no due process\nput in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just\nlike flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. And then there are\nspecific federal statutes, it's 18 241 and 18 242. And one of them applies to federal employees,\ngovernment employees, and the other one\napplies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United\nStates Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional\nrights are enumerated, for example, in the First\nAmendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes\naway rights that you have, they don't need to be\nspecifically enumerated rights in the Constitution order\nto still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have\nthe rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right, and so de-banking\nqualifies as a right, you know, right to access to the financial system,\nis every bit something that's subject to these\nlaws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, which is we've talked\nabout two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we've talked about the companies. The government employees\nfor sure have misbehaved. The companies, there's a very\ninteresting question there as to whether they are victims\nor perpetrators or both. You know, they will defend\nand they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims,\nnot perpetrators, right? They're the downstream\nsubjects of pressure, you know, not the cause of pressure, but there's a big swath of\npeople who are in the middle and specifically the ones that\nare funded by the government that I think are in\npossibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of these\nthird-party censorship bureaus. I mean the one that is\nsort of is most obvious is the so-called Stanford\nInternet Observatory that got booted up there\nover the last several years. And they basically were funded\nby the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in\nthis very interesting spot where there could be, you know, very obvious theory under\nwhich they're basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they're\nalso very exposed on this and have behaved in just\nflagrantly illegal ways. - So fundamentally, government should not\ndo any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? - Can't. Not allowed. - It really is disturbing. I mean it probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the the old will to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection 'cause you can't put a check\non power for government, right? - There are so many ways\nthat they can get you, like there are so many ways\nthey can come at you and get you and, you know, the thing\nhere to think about is a lot of times when people\nthink about government action, they think about legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It's like this, you know, fancy little bill sneaked\nalong and goes this- - I'm just the bill. Yeah.\n- Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. Like that doesn't actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly\nwhat we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about\ngovernment power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the\nequivalent of legislation, but having not gone through\nthe legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that\nthe DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They're regulated and there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche\nyou'll hear a lot, which is, \"Oh, private companies can\ndo whatever they want.\" It's like, \"Oh, no, they can't.\" They're subject to tens of\nthousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes\ndown when you don't comply with regulations is profound. Like they can completely\nwreck your company with no ability for you\nto do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole\nprogram a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency\nfor payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were gonna\nbuild into every product, and they were gonna be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government\nand they went to the, all these different try to\nfigure out how to make it, so it's like fully compliant\nwith anti-money laundering and all these, you know,\ncontrols and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters\nto the big banks saying, \"We're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every\naspect of your business is going to come under\ngreatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\" which is, of course, the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner\nrestaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov\ncocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? And like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a law, it's\nnot even a regulation, it's just like straight\ndirect state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they're just like flat\nout telling you what to do, which is, of course,\nwhat a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. And so anyway, so what\nthese companies experienced was they experienced the\nfull panoply of this, but the level of intensity\nwas in that order, it was actually, legislation\nwas the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important and then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were\nultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people\nwho don't do it, right? So like as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, you have to decide. You don't wanna live in\nthat regime. I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people\non the right got very angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. You know, maybe some people on the left will now not want their, you know, Democratic nominees to\nbe so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written\nin the FT just now saying, we just need like broad\nafter what we've been through in the last decade, we need to broad base\ntruth and reconciliation, you know, efforts to really\nget to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like ultimately, we need\npeople to go to jail 'cause we need to set\nobject lessons that say that you don't get to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to\nthe new administration, and I don't wanna speak for them and I don't wanna predict\nwhat they're gonna do, but they for sure have\nthe ability to do both of those things and you know,\nwe'll see where they take it. - Yeah, it's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants\nthis kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people\nthat are participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's\nthat kind of protection. Nobody wants that. - So I use the metaphor, the ring of power.\n- Yeah. - And for people who\ndon't catch the reference, that's \"Lord of the Rings.\" And the thing with the Ring of Power and \"Lord of the Rings,\"\nit's the ring the Gollum has in the beginning and\nit turns you invisible. And it turns out it like unlocks all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically, the moral\nlesson of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which was, you know, written by a guy who thought very deeply\nabout these things is, yeah, the ring of power is\ninherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they're like, \"Gandalf, just put on the\nring and like fix this.\" Right, and he will not put the ring on even to like end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. And then, you know, as it starts, the character of Gollum is\nthe result of, you know, like a normal character\nwho ultimately becomes, you know, this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. And so, I mean, I think you said something\nactually quite profound there, which is the ring of power\nis infinitely tempting. You know, the censorship\nmachine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, like\nyou are going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting\n'cause it's so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people\nfeel any of this today. They should. I don't know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years\nlater, you know, you would hope that you would realize that\nyour soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being, you know, extremely authoritarian\nand anti-democratic and anti-Western. - Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the\nmost powerful human on Earth. - I'm not sure about that. - You don't think he is? - Well, he doesn't have the nukes so. - Nukes. (Marc laughing) Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? - Yeah. - How can he and/or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting\naspects of this power? - I mean, I think the\ndanger is there with power. It's flat out there. I would say with Elon, we'll see. I would say with Elon, and\nI would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would\nsay so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost\nevery front for like, you know, the last 30 years. (Lex laughing) But including all this stuff recently, like I think he's been a\nreal hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say,\nI guess the sort of case that he has this level of\npower is that some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are, you know, are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is, I do think a lot of how\nElon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's the companies\nhe's running directly where I think he's doing very well, and we're investors in multiple\nof them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements, and then it's the downstream\neffects of his statements. So like for example, it's, you know, for the last couple weeks,\nit's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this\nrape gang scandal, you know, this rape organized child\nrape thing in the UK. And you know, it's a preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren't willing to talk about it, it kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden\nthere's now in the UK this like massive explosion\nof basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's\nkind of woken up and being like, \"Oh, my God,\nyou know, this is really bad.\" And there will be now, you know, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know,\nhe played the role of the boy who said, the emperor\nhas no clothes, right? But here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about\nsomething that was true, right? And so had he said it about\nsomething that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody\nover there instantly, they were like, \"Oh, yeah,\nhe's right,\" right? (laughs) Like nobody seriously\nsaid they're just arguing the details now. So number one, it's like,\nokay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far... Put it this way. Like, how worried are we about\nsomebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say,\nespecially in the last decade of what we've been through where everybody's been lying\nall the time about everything, I'd say, I think we\nshould run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the\nmoney and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like it,\nthere's a clear-cut case that the more money in\npolitics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic\nof public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary\noutspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost. You'll notice that money and\npolitics has all most vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Trump spent far, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don't know, something like 3 billion total in Trump, I think spent again like a\nthird or a fourth of that. And so the money in politics kind of topic has kind of vanished from\na popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit\nnow that Elon is spending. You know, but again, it's like, okay, he's spending,\nbut the data would seem to indicate in the last, at\nleast in the last eight years, that money doesn't win\nthe political battles. It's actually like the\nvoters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there I\nwould say like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and use in a definitive way. - And I don't know if\nthose parallels there, but I could also say\njust on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that's not always the case. So that's a good thing there.\n- Yeah. - If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. (laughs) Who gets to put on the ring? - [Marc] Frodo. - Frodo, yeah.\n- Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of\n\"Lord of the Rings\" right, is even Frodo would've been, you know, even Frodo would've been corrupted, right? But, you know, nevertheless,\nyou had somebody who could do what it took at at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because it's sort of our\npost-Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort of this post-secularized\nChristian context in the West now, and it's, you know, we\nconsider Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe\nessentially all the same things. We just dress them up\nin sort of fake science. (Lex laughing) So the one thing that we're all told, we're all taught from early is that the best people in\nthe world are the people who care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know,\nall of our figures are people who care about all of, you know... Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared\nabout all of humanity. Like it's this universe, the person who cares the\nmost about everybody. And with Elon, you have a\nguy who literally, like, is, he talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly\nthe same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us through\nmulti-planetary civilization, so that we can survive a\nstrike on any one planet, so that we can extend the\nlight of human consciousness into the world and, you\nknow, into the universe and have it persist, you know, in the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. (both laughing) - Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. - Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear. - You said that we\nalways end up being ruled by the elite of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? - So this comes from a\nItalian political philosopher from about 100 years ago named Robert... I'm gonna mangle it from, let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. And then I learned about\nit through a famous book on politics, probably the\nbest book on politics written in the 20th century called \"The Machiavellians\"\nby this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in \"The Machiavellians,\" he resurrects what he calls is this sort of Italian realist school of political philosophy from the '10s and '20s. And\nthese were people, to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who\nwere trying to understand the actual mechanics of how\npolitics actually works. So to get to the actual sort\nof mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, Michels\nhad this concept ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law of oligarchy, and I mean take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy 'cause it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there's basically three\nforms of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of many. There's oligarchy, which\nis rule of the few. And there's monarchy,\nwhich is rule of the one. And you can just use that\nas a general framework of any government you're gonna be under is gonna be one of those,\njust mechanical observation without even saying\nwhich one's good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that\nMichels asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like is there actually\nsuch a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually\nlike direct government? And what he did was he mounted this sort of\nincredible historical exploration of whether democracies had\never existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most\ndemocratic private organization in the world that he\ncould find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist\nGerman autoworkers union that was like wholly\ndevoted to the workers of the world uniting, you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization\nout of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and\nhe is like, \"Oh, nope.\" There's a leadership class. You know, there's like six guys at the top and they control everything (laughs) and then they lead the rest\nof the membership along, you know, by the nose, which is, of course, the\nstory of every union. The story of every union is\nalways the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers' union, right? Like, you know, there's\na guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number\ntwo is his son, right? Like, that's not like a, you\nknow, an accident, right? So the iron law oligarchy\nbasically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling\nelite structurally. And he said, \"The reason for that is because the masses\ncan't organize,\" right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is\n25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize,\nthe majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in\npolitics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a\nsmall organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence... I forget the name of it. It was called like The Workers' Revolt or something like that. There was like a two-year period where they basically experimented\nwith direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition\nsystem, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. You know, anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes\nit's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe, and it's caused enormous\ndamage to the state. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And so of course, they didn't\ngive us a direct democracy, they gave us a representative\ndemocracy, right? And so they built the\noligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch\nand the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson\nof \"The Machiavellians\" is you can deny that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think\nabout how to make a system work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that\nis actually what's happening. - And lucky for us, the founders saw this\nand figured out a way to, given that there's going\nto be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite-\n- Yes. - So it doesn't get out of hand. - And it was very clever. Right? And you know, some of this was\nbased on earlier experiments. By the way, you know, these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of like Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance\nhistory, you know, \"The Federalist Papers,\" they\nargue this a great length. You can read it all. You know, they ran like a\none of the best seminars in world history trying\nto figure this out. And they went through all this and yeah. And so they thought\nthrough it very carefully, but just, I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did it just through the three\nbranches of government, right? Executive, legislative and judicial, sort of balance of powers. But the other way, they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done earlier. I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, right? And so the, you know,\nthe House and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population,\nand the Senate is not, right? The small states have\njust as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get\nreelected every two years to make it very responsive\nto the will of the people. And they made the decision\nto have the Senate get reelected every six years\nso that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose\none or the other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does\nit live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And you know, there's lots of open\nquestions there, but you know, this system has survived\nfor coming on 250 years with a country that has been\nspectacularly successful. But I don't think, at least,\nyou know, I don't think any of us would trade the\nsystem for any other one. And so it's, yeah, one of the\ngreat all-time achievements. - Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were\nall pretty young relative to our current set of leaders.\n- They were. Many in their 20s at the\ntime, and like super geniuses. This is one of those things\nwhere it's just like, all right, something happened where there\nwas a group of people where, you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einsteins of politics. Yeah. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical\npractice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused\non what would actually work, which is, you know, I\nthink the way to think about these things. - There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. - They were shape rotators,\nnot word cells. (laughs) - I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were center to them, you're center to a lot of memes. - [Marc] I was. - You're the meme dealer\nand the meme popularizer. - That's true. That meme I get some credit for and then the current thing is, the other one I get some credit for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. - Take credit and run with it. - [Marc] Yep. - If we can just linger\non the Machiavellians. It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned looking\nat the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've\nseen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting\nthings you can sort of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? - Yeah, so a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this\na bit with the universities, which is you can apply a\nMachiavellian-style lens to the... It's why I posed the\nquestion to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the\nuniversity, the trustees, the administration, the\nstudents or the faculty? And you know, the true\nanswer is some combination of the three or of the\nfour, plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera, right? And so you know, there's a mechanical\ninterpretation of that. I mean, companies operate\nunder the exact same, you know, set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like the CEO runs the\ncompany basically up to the day that either the shareholders\nor the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt,\nit's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it's very hard for the\nCEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if The New\nYork Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand\nis who can get who fired? You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper\ncolumnist who makes, you know, $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes, you\nknow, $200 million a year. And it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before\nI have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. - Did anyone ever get fired\nfrom the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? (laughs) So Bill like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. - No, 'cause what happens\nis they wear it with a... And yeah, I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, right? Which is, you know, if\nthey're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably\npriding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to legitimate criticism and, you know, they're\nobviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight\nto the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. You know, and I happen to know the CEO, and I think he's quite a good CEO, but I like, well, this is a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer\nrun his own company, right? Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating\nplaying out right now. Not to dwell on these fires, but you see the pressure\nreveals things, right? And so if you've been\nwatching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, like whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical\nsocial revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It's endorses every crazy\nleft-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of\nall the people who, you know, are currently burning\nthe city to the ground. It's just like endorsed\nevery single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, for the first time, I think put his foot down right\nbefore the November election and said, we're getting... He said, \"We're gonna get outta this thing where we just always\nendorse the Democrat.\" And we said, we're not\nendorsing, I think he said, \"We're not endorsing for the presidency.\" And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like our billionaire backer who's... And I don't know what he spends, but like, he must be burning 50 or 100\nmillion dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. He paid 500 million for\nit, which is amazing. Back when people still thought\nthese things were businesses. And then he's probably\nburned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another\n50, 100 million a year to do this. And the journalists at\nthe LA Times hate him with the fury of 1,000 suns. Like they just like absolutely\nfreaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones that\ncan get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, you know,\nmost horrible things about him. And they wanna constantly run\nthese stories attacking him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in\nLA are having right now to this fire, and to this just like\nincredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head\nendorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour,\nhe's basically just, he's decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his\nown newspaper. (laughs) Very smart guy. He is not a press tour and\nhe is basically saying, yeah, yes, we did all that and we\nendorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and\nwe're gonna completely change. And his paper is, you know,\nin a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn't been him. (laughs) It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, the\nowner is showing up saying, \"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge.\" And the reporters are\nsaying, \"No, you're not.\" And like it is freaking on. And so again, if the, the\nMachiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power\nactually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and super powerful who even\nowns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full-scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist? - And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there. - And firing people.\n- Firing people. Yeah. - You know, he has removed\npeople and he has set new rules. I mean, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying he's now at long last actually\nexercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other\nowners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know, so\nhe's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really\ninteresting open question. Like, you know, in a fight\nbetween the employees and the employer, like\nit's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. - And just to stay on\njournalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just wanna say put him in\nthe category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever\nseen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. - What do you think is like\nthe most impressive example? - Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to, like, I mean, it's like kicking\nthe beehive or whatever, you know, what's gonna follow and do that. I mean that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia\nand then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer\njust tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. And just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people\nlike that out in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be\ncourageous themselves. - Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? - I knew of Neri, his wife, who's a brilliant\nresearcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she's amazing. - Well, the reason I ask\nif you knew about Bill is because a lot of people\nhad not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before some of the\ncampaigns he's been running since in public, and with\nHarvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he was so-called activist\ninvestor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected\nfor probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out, they weren't for the most part battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national\nstories, but in the business and investing world, the\nactivist investor is a very, it's like in the movie \"Taken.\" It's a very specific set of skills. (both laughing) - Yeah. - On how to like really take control of situations.\n- Yeah. - And how to wreck the people\nwho you're going up against. And there's been\ncontroversy over the years on this topic, and there's\ntoo much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid is,\nyou know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly\nmanaged or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that\nmeans the existing management is become entrenched and\nlazy, mediocre, you know, whatever. Not, you're responding to the\nneeds of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically\ngo in with a minority position and then they rally support\namong other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show\nup and they force change. But they are the\naggressive version of this. And I've been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these-\n- Oh-oh. - Where it is amazing\nhow much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don't have formal control. So it would be another chess\npiece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens\nis the effective analysts, a large amount of time, they end up taking over\ncontrol of companies even though they never own more than like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it\nturns out with Bill's, it's such a fascinating case. 'Cause he has that like complete skillset. - (laughs) Yeah. - And he has now decided\nto bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of\nthese places, you know, and some of these battles\nare still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of\npeople who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now\nwith infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that\nkind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook, like in real time. And so Liam Neeson skillset is\ngetting more broadly diffused just by being able to\nwatch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody\nwho's really affecting how all this is playing out. - But even skillset\naside just courage and- - Yes, including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, 'cause like he hasn't been, I'll give you an example. Like my firm venture\ncapital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I\nfeel like I can't do or say 'cause I feel like I would\nbe bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where\nhe worries about that. And so a couple things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship\nwith his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors...\nI know this for a fact. His investors have been\nremarkably supportive of him doing that. 'Cause as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. And so it is the same thing he does in the his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip\nof the spear on something that actually a lot\nmore people agree with. - Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. - And just again, our, you know, how I started is a lot of\npeople are just fed up. - You've been spending a\nbunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new\nadministration in many ways, including interviewing\npeople who might join. So what's your general\nsense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new administration? - So I should start by saying I'm not a member of\nthe new administration. I'm not like in the room\nwhen a lot of these people are being selected. - I believe you said unpaid intern. - I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and I,\nyou know, when helpful, but I'm not making the decisions,\nnor am I in a position to, you know, speak for the administration. So I don't wanna say anything that would cause people\nto think I'm doing that. It's a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is outta office, and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll recall,\nthere was a fair amount of controversy over the\nend of the first term. - Oh, yeah. - The specific concern was, you know, the first Trump administration, you know, they will all say this is like, they didn't come in with a team, right? So you know, they didn't\ncome in with a team and most of the sort of institutional base of the Republican Party\nwere Bush Republicans. And many of them had\nbecome never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time\nputting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time\ngetting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them 2 to 3\nyears to kind of even get the government in place. And then they basically only\nhad the government in place, you know, for basically like\n18 months, and then COVID hit. You know, and then sort of\nthe aftermath and everything, and all the drama and\nheadlines and everything. And so the concern, you know, including from some various smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he gonna be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? 'Cause maybe people got burned out. Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing\nto go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people\nin the first term came under, like, you know, with their\nown withering legal assaults, and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a\nlot of stuff happened, lots of investigations,\nlots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots\nof debanking, by the way. A lot of the officials in the\nfirst Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. - Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. - In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and\nchildren with our ring of power. And so there's like\nthis legitimate question as to like, whether, okay, what will the team for\nthe second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing\nwith the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks\nbetter than the first term and not 'cause the\npeople in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like, influx of like incredibly\ncapable people that have shown up that wanna be part of this, and you just didn't have\nthat the first time. And so they're just\ndrawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than\nthey had the first time. And they're drawing on people\nwho know what the game is. Like they're drawing\non people now who know what is gonna happen and\nthey're still willing to do it. And so they're gonna\nget, I think, you know, some of the best people\nfrom the first term, but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get\nthe first time around. And then second is\nthere's a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they're just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned\nhow everything works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view and now they're 10 years older and they're ready to\ngo serving government. And so there's a\ngenerational shift happening. And actually one of the\ninteresting things about the team that's forming up is\nit's remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members,\nand then many of the second and third level people are\nlike in their 30s and 40s, you know, which is a big change\nfrom the gerontocracy that, you know, we've been under\nfor the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has\nbeen outstanding, you know, and we could sit here and\nlist tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people\nwho are running, you know, it's everything from the people who are running all the\ndifferent departments at HHS. It's the people running, you know, the number two at the\nPentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got, actually two of\nmy partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah, like many, many\nparts of the government, the people are like, really impressive. - Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the\nhuman being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's kind of circles\nof sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically\nsuck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good\nposition to speak to the degree that's happening versus\nhiring based on merit and just getting great teams. - Yeah, so look, I just\nstart by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are, you know, very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. Like he definitely seems\nvery aware of that. So that's one thing. I would just say that the, I\nthink the way to look at that, I mean, and look, like I said, I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say that it's again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished\npeople in the business world and in the medical field. I just, you know, Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH, so I was actually, I was\npart of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. - Nice. Jay's amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. - So I literally got, this is a story. I got to the transition\noffice for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the\ninterview interviewing teams, and they gave us, I didn't\nknow who the candidates were, and they gave us the\nsheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I\nsaw Jay's name, and I, like, I almost physically fell outta my chair. - Yeah. - And I was just like... (laughs) You know, and\nI happen to know Jay, I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like, talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure- - Yeah.\n- Over the last five years. - And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and\nthoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly- - Very serious, very\nanalytical, very applied. And yes, 100%. Tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look\nback at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you\nknow, none of us are perfect, but like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And, you know, we would all\nbe much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just like an\nincredibly capable guy. And look, and then he\nlearned from all that, right? He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody\nlike that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly. It's just a gigantic upgrade. You know, and then Marty\nMakary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a\nCDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been\nspending time with Dr. Oz, so, you know, and I'm not, like, again, I'm not on these teams. I'm not in the room. But like, I've been\nspending enough time trying to help that, like his level of insight into the healthcare system,\nit's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy\nwho's been like in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this\nstuff and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for,\nyou know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, he's like a walking\nencyclopedia on these things. And you know, very dynamic, you know, very charismatic, very\nsmart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have\nsomebody like that in there. And so anyway, they're\njust, I have like 30 of these stories now across\nall these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast\nto the last four years. And it, not even, these people\nare not in the same ballpark. They're just like wildly better. And so it, you know, the pound for pound is\nmaybe be the best team in the White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team\nlike this or something. But there's a lot of really\ngood people in there now. - Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to DOGE? What's the most wildly successful\nnext two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also, can you think\nabout the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges\nwould it be facing? - Yeah, so start by\nsaying, again, I'm not... Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer, I'm not on DOGE, (laughs)\nI'm not a member of DOGE. - We should say there's\nabout 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring. No, I'm just kidding. - Both the angels and\nthe devils on my shoulder are-\n- Okay. All right, cool. - So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE. I'm not in charge of DOGE.\n- Yeah. - Those guys are doing\nit, I'm not doing it. But you know, again,\nI'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, I mean, the basic outlines\nare in public, right? Which it's a time limited, you\nknow, basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the\nexecutive branch, right? And so the implementation\nwill happen through the White House. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is the three kind of streams,\nyou know, kind of target sets, and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. And so, you know, the headline\nnumber, they, you know, put us the $2 trillion number and there's already, you know, disputes over that and whatever, and there's whole question there. But then there's the people thing. And the people thing is\ninteresting 'cause you get into these very kind of\nfascinating questions. And I've been doing this,\nI won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this\nfor people in government as a pop quiz, and I can stump\nthem every time, which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere\nbetween 450 and 520. And nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for\nthe federal government? And the answer is, you know,\nsomething on the order, I forget, but like 4\nmillion full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large\npeople component to this. And then by the way, there's\na related component to that, which is how many of them\nare actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings\nare still empty, right? And then there's questions\nof like, are people, you know, working from home? Or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension, and of course, the money and\nthe people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing, right? And I described earlier\nhow basically our system of government is much more\nnow based on regulations than legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that\nwent through Congress. They're from an agency that,\nthat created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is, Elon have already described, we wanna do the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the\ngovernment off people's backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. But there's also something\nelse that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set\nof Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that\nwent directly after the idea that the executive branch can\ncreate regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding\ncongressional legislation. And most of the federal\ngovernment that exists today, including most of the departments\nand most of the rules, and most of the money,\nand most of the people, most of it is not enforcing\nlaws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \"Large parts, you know, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress,\nthe way that the cartoon said that it should, that may\nnot actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to, they\ndid nothing based on this. They didn't, you know,\npull anything back in. But the new regime, if they\nchoose to, could say, \"Look, the thing that we're doing here is not, you know, challenging the laws, we're actually complying with\nthe Supreme Court decision that basically says we have\nto unwind a lot of this, and we have to unwind the regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional, we have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people.\" And that's how you get from, basically you connect the\nthread from the regulation part back to the money part,\nback to the people part. They have work going on\nall three of these threads. They have, I would say,\nincredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super\ncynical on this topic. And they're like, \"This is impossible. This could never possibly work.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I can't tell you what the secret plans are,\nbut like blow my mind.\" And all three of those,\nlike, they have ideas that are like really quite\namazing as you'd expect from, you know, from the people involved. And so over the course of the\nnext few months, you know, that'll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is, this is going to be very\ndifferent than attempts, like there have been other\nprograms like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one, and then there were others\nbefore that, Reagan had one. The difference is this\ntime, their social media. And so there has never been like, it's interesting, one of the\nreasons people in Washington are so cynical is because\nthey know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad\nspending and all the bad rules and all the, like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion\ndollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that's compounding, and\nit's now passing the size of the defense department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon it's gonna\nbe adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be\nadding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point we enter a\nhyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or\nBrazil and (indistinct), right? And so, like everybody in\nDC knows that something has to be done, and then\neverybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible\nto do anything, right? They know all the problems and they also know the sheer\nimpossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're\nnot taking into account, that what the critics are not taking into account\nis these guys can do this in the full light of day and\nthey can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism, they can expose any element\nof, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government spending. They can run victory\nlapse every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the\npeople into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our\nMachiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy,\noligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of\nthe few, rule of the one. You could think about what's\nhappening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president, rule\nof the one with some power. And then we have the\npeople who can't organize, but they can be informed\nand they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich\nhappening right now, is a way to think about it, which is you've got basically (indistinct) if you got rule of one combining with the rule of many, right? And rule of many is they\ndo get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically. And then essentially\nCongress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic\nclass in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, I think have the power to\ndo all kinds of things here, and I think that would be\nthe way I would wash it. - The transparency. I mean, Elon, just by\nwho he is incentivized to be transparent and show\nthe bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's gonna be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just\nmakes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. - These people are spending our money. - [Lex] Yeah. - These people have enormous\ncontempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here's the thing\nyou hear in Washington, here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear\nis, \"This is impossible, they'll be able to do nothing.\" And then, yeah, I walk them\nthrough this and they're like, it starts to dawn on them that\nthis is a new kind of thing. And then they're like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in\nentitlements and the debt and the military.\" And so like, yeah, you've\ngot like this silly, fake whatever, you know,\nNPR funding or whatever, and like, it's a rounding\nerror and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever,\n$500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging\nstations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they bill eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And costs you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn't matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer\nis like, \"What the fuck?\" (Lex laughing) - What do you mean?\n- It's $30 billion. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then the experts are like, and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's surrounding error.\" No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this\ncavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you're\nabout the 3 trillion. - Yeah.\n- Okay. Then there's the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the\nfederal budget and percentage? No, it's not. But $30 billion divided\nby 30, do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like, what's that math expert? - $100. - $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic\nrelationship with your wife. There's like 100 things\nthat that person can do with $100 that they're not doing 'cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where\nthe money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that $30\nbillion program is not something that is like a very\nimportant thing to go after, is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer-\n- Yeah. - Is just off the charts. And then that's just\none of those programs, there's like 100 of those programs and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of\nthis stuff is running well, like the one thing we know is that none of this\nstuff is running well. Like we know that for sure, right? And we know these people\naren't showing up to work and like we know that all this crazy stuff is happening, right? And like, you know, do you remember Elon's\nstory of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. Okay so Pennsylvania is\nlike a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness, and death, right? And the federal government\nhas just like, let it happen, these incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing\nlaw enforcement thing that they needed to do in\nPennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling\nraw milk with armed raids. - [Lex] Right. - And it turns out it\nreally pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places\n'cause they don't have cars. But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the\nreasons why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law\nenforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, like the system's not working. And so you add up, just\npick $130 billion programs. All right, now you're okay. Math major, 100 times 100. - 10,000. - $10,000. Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. - But it's also not just about money. That's really, obviously money\nis a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude- - [Marc] Yes. - That then in sort of, in\nthe ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody\nwants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that corruption\ncan, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy 'cause you don't wanna be transparent about having done nothing all\nyear, all this kind of stuff. And you now wanna reverse that, so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government,\nbecause the amazing thing if you're to steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can\ndirectly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting. As long as there's no\nbureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. - Yeah. So here's the trick, this blew my mind 'cause I was, you know, once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in\ngovernment called impoundment. And so if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning\nis a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires\nCongress to authorize money to be spent by the\nexecutive branch, right? So the executive branch\ngoes to Congress says, \"We need money X.\" Congress does their thing. They come back and they\nsay, \"You can have money Y.\" The money's appropriated from Congress, the executive branch\nspends it on the military or whatever they spend it\non, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations\nto nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an\nadditional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which\nis the executive branch not only needs Congress to\nappropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is\nnot allowed to underspend. - Yeah, I'm aware of\nthis. I'm aware of this. - And so there's this thing\nthat happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal\nyear, which is September 30th, and it's the great budget flush. And any remaining money\nthat's in the system that they don't know how\nto productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively. - Yep. - To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn't wanna spend the\nmoney can't not spend it. - Yeah. - Like, okay, A, that's not\nwhat's in the constitution. And there's actually quite\na good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that's played\nout in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I\nthink an open mind, you're like, \"All right, this is not\nwhat the founders meant.\" And then number two, again,\nwe go back to this thing of contempt, like, can\nyou imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you're\ndoing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've\nsold your soul, right? Like it's just like, I actually\nthink you sort of had it in a really good point,\nwhich is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. - Yeah.\n- Right. 'Cause it makes them bad people. And they didn't start out\nwanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this like- - Yeah, everywhere.\n- Everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged\nwhat I've seen so far. - It seems like a lot of people\nwill try to slow 'em down, but yeah-\n- For sure. - I hope they get far.\n- Yeah. - Another difficult topic, immigration. - [Marc] Yeah. - What's your take on the, let's say, heated H-1B visa debate\nthat's going on online and legal immigration in general? - Yeah, I should so start by saying, I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I'm not planning to be,\nthis is not an issue that I'm working on or\nthat I'm going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing.\nSo my firm is doing, so like, I'm not in this in the new\nadministration or the government. I'm not planning to be, so\npurely just personal opinion. So I would say I would\ndescribe as a complex or nuanced, hopefully\nnuanced view on this issue that's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I kind of thought\nabout this, you know, I didn't say anything about\nit all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a\nlot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a\nvery different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because\nof the combination of where I came from and\nthen where I ended up. And so, oh, let's start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration\nargument many, many times the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been\nin DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of\ntrying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more\nhigh-skilled immigration. And, you know, I think that\nargument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, has paid off for the\nUS in many, many ways. And we can go through it,\nbut I think it's the argument everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's, right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. - So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you\ncan get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity\nof the US companies. - Yeah, and then it's not just good for the them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry,\nit's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that\nthen create many more jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would've previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Like everybody wins,\nthere are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely\nglorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be\na moral right argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against\nit is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right, I mean that-\n- Right. - That's the thing. And like I said, I've made\nthat argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd also say, look,\nI would say number one, I believe a lot of it,\nI'll talk about the parts I don't believe, but\nI believe a lot of it. And then the other part is,\nlook, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, like\nmy own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends, you know,\nare just this like amazing, you know, panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And you know, I've worked,\nI dunno at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And hopefully, over time, it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And you know, it's been amazing and they've done many of\nthe most important things in my industry and it's\nbeen really remarkable. So that's all good. And then, you know, there's\njust the practical version of the argument, which\nis we are the main place these people get educated anyway, right? The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, this is the old kind of Mitt\nRomney, staple a green card to every, you know, at least, you know, maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologist\nwe could quibble about, but you know, the roboticist\nfor sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- - At least I won you\nover on something today. - Well, no, I'm\nexaggerating for effect, so- - Oh. (Marc laughing) And I lost you,\nI had you for half a second. - I haven't gotten to the\nother side of the argument yet. - [Lex] Okay, thank you.\n- So surely, we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. - The rollercoaster is going up. - The rollercoaster is\nrationing slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists\nshould all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot\nof merit to that, obviously. Like, look, we want the\nUS to be the world leader in robotics. What step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the\ngreat robotics people, right? Like, you know, very,\nunlike the underpants. No, it's like a very\nstraightforward formula, right? - Yeah. - All right, that's all\nwell and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that you also hear from,\nyou know, these same people, and I have made this\nargument myself many times, which is, we need to do this because we don't have\nenough people in the US who can do it otherwise, right? We have all these unfilled\njobs, we've got all these, you know, all these companies\nthat wouldn't exist. We don't have enough good founders, we don't have enough engineers, we don't have enough scientists. Or then the next version\nof the argument below that is our education\nsystem is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way, 'cause like our education\nsystem is good enough for foreigners to be able\nto come here preferentially in like a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native-born people. So there's like a weird, there's\nlittle cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into and kind of wonder about, and we'll come back to that one. But like, at least, yes, our\neducation system has its flaws. And then underneath that is\nthe argument that, you know, Vivek made, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, you know, native-born\npeople in the country, you know, don't work hard enough, and spend too much time\nwatching TV and TikTok and don't spend enough\ntime studying differential, you know, equations. And again, it's like, all\nright, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair amount to that. Like there's a lot of American\nculture that is, you know, there's a lot of frivolity,\nthere's a lot of, you know, like, I mean, we have\nwell-documented social issues in many fronts, many things that cut\nagainst having a culture of just like straightforward\nhigh achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those\nare the basic arguments. But then I have this kind of\nother side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought\nprocess, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And you know, it's interesting,\nthere's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin\nto, you know, high tech. And so it's like, all right,\nwhy is that exactly, right? And then I know this, I'm an aberration. Like I was the only one\nfrom anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right? I know what an aberration I am, and I know exactly how\nthat aberration happened, and it's a very unusual,\nyou know, set of steps, including, you know,\nmany that were just luck. But like, there is in\nno sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like, not at all. There is also like, in no sense\na talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from\nthe South into high tech. There is no flow from the\nSunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the Deep South into high tech. Just like, literally it's like the blank. There's this whole section of the country that just where the people\njust like for some reason don't end up in tech. Now, that's a little bit strange, 'cause these are the people\nwho put a man on the moon. These are the people who built\nthe World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the Second\nIndustrial Revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network, and built, you know,\nlogistics and transportation in the auto in, I mean,\nthe auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people's\nparents and grandparents and great grandparents\nsomehow had the wherewithal to like build all of\nthis like amazing things, invent all these things. And then there's many,\nmany, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism\nwhere you had people who grew up in the middle of\nnowhere, Philo Farnsworth, who invented the television,\nand just like, you know, tons and tons of others,\nendless stories like this. Now you have a, like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, okay, like what is happening on\nthe blank spot of the map? And then of course, you\nalso can't help noticing that the blank spot on the\nmap, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, \"Oh,\nwell, that's interesting. Like how did that happen?\" Right? And so either you really,\nreally, really have to believe the very, very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you\nhave to believe that like, that basically culture, the\nwhole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country\nis so like, deeply flawed, either inherently flawed\nor culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they are not able to do the\nthings that their, you know, parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess\non what else is happening? - You mean what, affirmative action? - Affirmative action. Okay. (laughs) This is\nvery, think about this, this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. - Right. - Nor does it have any victims at all. - That could explain\nmaybe disproportionate, but like, surely it doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. - What educational institution\nin the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? - But what institution rejected\nfarm boys from Wisconsin? - All of them.\n- All of them. - Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this\nis because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago, these were big court cases. And you know, 'cause the\nidea of affirmative action has been litigated for\nmany, many, many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly\nin the past had upheld that it was a completely\nlegitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative action that\nlike really matter, right? One is the admissions into\neducational institutions, and then the other is jobs, right? Getting hired. Like, those are the two biggest areas. The education one is like super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time, for all, you know, people have written and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments\nfor why it's important, there's many arguments as\nto how it could backfire. It's been this thing. But the Supreme Court upheld\nit for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer, I don't\nhave the exact reference in my head, but there was a\ncase in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O'Connor famously\nwrote that, you know, although it had been 30\nyears of affirmative action, and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended,\nshe said that, you know, well, basically we need to\ntry it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically\nthe issues it's intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming\nup on the 25 years, right? It's a couple years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases is, it's a Harvard case and I think a University\nof North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those\ncases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions\nactually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit\nas cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it's a ring of power. And if you're an admissions\nofficer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power\nto do what you want, and you can justify any of\nit under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases,\nit had been a black box where you didn't have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically\nrequired showing the work. And there was like all kinds\nof like phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there\nwere text messages in there that will just curl your hair of people, of students being spoken of and just like crude racial stereotypes that would just make you\nwant to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. But also, there was\nstatistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is\nthat at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs\nfor SAT that are as wide as 400 points, right? So different groups. So a specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points\nhigher than other ethnicities in order to actually\nget admitted into these. I mean, this is not even about, I mean, white people are a part of this, but like Asians are like\na very big part of this. And actually the Harvard\ncase is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students\nwho were being turned away. And it's basically, I\nmean it's the cliche now in the valley and in\nthe medical community, which is like if you want a super genius, you hire an Asian from Harvard 'cause they are guaranteed\nto be freaking Einstein. 'Cause if they weren't, they were never getting admitted, right? Almost all the qualified\nAsians get turned away. So they've been running this,\nit's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been\na third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really\nchanged the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthey can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a\nsingle education institution in America that is conforming\nwith the Supreme Court ruling. I think they're all\nflagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. - Mostly 'cause of\nmomentum probably, or what? - They are trying to make\nthe world a better place. They're trying to solve\nall these social problems. They are trying to have\ndiverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They're trying to make\ntheir faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they're good people. - [Lex] Right. - They're trying to have\nthe press write nice things about them. Like it's nearly impossible for them. And you know, to be clear,\nlike nobody has been fired from an admissions office for,\nyou know, 25 years of prior, what we now, the Supreme Court now is\nruled to be illegality. And so they're all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so like I, you know, the numbers are moving a little bit, but like, I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they're\ncompliant with the Supreme Court. Like who's in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university's rule of the\nSupreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules\nthe universities, right? Well, another example of that is, I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right\nnow went to either Harvard or Yale, right? Like the level of\nincestuousness here is... Anyway, so there's that. And so this has been running\nfor a very long time. So one is the Harvard and\nUSC cases kind of gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the\nother thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was\nhappening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at\nall the top institutions for Jewish applicants was\nthey were being managed down, either being actively\nmanaged down as a percentage of the base. And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely\nexplicit, basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative\npercentage of the US population, which is 2%. And you know, there's\na whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago,\nJews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big\ncampaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became\n30% of these institutions 'cause there's so many\nsmart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been\ntrying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish\npeople I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, right? And so all of a sudden, so basically, the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this\nin terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in\nterms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? And then, of course, there's the thing that you\nbasically can't talk about, which is all the white\npeople are being excluded. And then it turns out it's\nalso happening to Black people, and this is the thing that like blew my freaking\nmind when I found out about it. So I just assumed that\nlike, this was great news for like American Blacks, because like, you know, obviously\nif you know Whites, Asians and Jews are being excluded,\nthen, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was\nto get the Black population up. And so this must be great\nfor American Blacks. So then I discovered this New\nYork Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? (laughs) - [Lex] Uh-oh. - And again, and by the way,\nthis is in The New York Times, this is not in like, you know, whatever, National Review,\nthis is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that\nwere quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the dean of the\nAfrican-American Studies, you know, community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme\nCourt appointee under, I think she was a close\nfriend of Hillary Clinton. And there was, for a long time, she was on the shortlist\nfor Supreme Court. So one of the top, you know, jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black was sort\nof legendarily successful in the academic and\nlegal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the\nauthorities in this story and the story that they tell, (laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education institutions and\nit's happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government, which\nis at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard\nwere not American-born Blacks. They were foreign-born Blacks, specifically, Northern\nAfrican off generally Nigerian or West Indian, right? And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very\nsuccessful Nigerian-Americans as a group like way outperformed, they're, you know, this a\nsuper smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said\nin the story is Harvard is basically struggling to\neither, whatever it was, identify or recruit, make successful, whatever it was,\nAmerican-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were\nusing high-skill immigration, as an escape hatch to go get\nBlacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs in the last 20 years have had\nthis exact characteristic. There's large numbers of\nBlack people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \"It's obviously not us that\nare getting these slots, we're literally competing with people who are being imported.\" And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action,\nyou are trying to make up for historical injustice\nof American Black slavery. So the idea that you're import\nsomebody from, you know, Nigeria that never\nexperienced that, you know, is like tremendously\ninsulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see\nwhere I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year\nsocial engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into, right? And so it turns out it's\nnot a victim-free thing, there's like 100%, there's victims. 'Cause why? There's only so many, for sure. There's only so many education slots. And then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs, right? You know, Google only\nhires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers, right? And so that's the other side of it, right? And so you're a farm\nboy in Wisconsin, right? You know, Black American\nwhose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship,\n300 years ago, in Louisiana or a, you know, Cambodian\nimmigrant in, you know, the Bronx and you are a kid or a Jewish\nimmigrant or a, you know, or from a very successful Jewish family and you know, your entire, you\nknow, for three generations, you and your parents and\ngrandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those\ngroups know is the system that has been created\nis not for them, right? It's designed specifically\nto exclude them. And then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, \"Yeah, let's bring\nin more foreigners,\" right? And so anyway, so the\nshort version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the, quote,\n\"high-skill immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also\nhaving the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another\nword for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative\naction conversation. And you need to actually\ndeal with this at substance and to see what's actually\nhappening to people. you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for\nhigh-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took\nover both the education process and the hiring process.\n- Okay, so first of all, that was brilliantly laid\nout, the nuance of it. So just to understand, it's\nnot so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to\nbe more people saying, yay, we need more American-born hires. - So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on\nthis and not saying anything, and what I was... (Lex laughing) Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of- - Yeah, that was very Zen. - Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of\nit, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the\ndog that didn't bark, right? And the dog that didn't\nbark was, I did not, and you tell me if you saw one, I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart\nkids who are already here into these educational\ninstitutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. - That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.\n- But it was like literally, it was like the proponents\nof high-skilled immigrant. And again, this was me\nfor a very long time. I mean, I kind of took\nmyself by surprise on this because I was on, you\nknow, I had the much, say, simpler version of this\nstory for a very... And like I said, I've been\nin Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But you know, I've been on\nthe other side of this one, but I was literally sitting\nthere being like, all right, which of these like super\ngeniuses who, you know, many of whom by the\nway are very, you know, successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled\nimmigrants, you know, which of these super\ngeniuses are gonna like, say actually we have this like\nincredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about native-born\nAmericans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure. Those four groups. - But also-\n- Yes. - White people. - Yeah, and also white people. - People that are making the\ncase for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're\nmaking that case are often not making it in a way that's like, making it in quite a radical way. - Yeah.\n- Let's put it this way. - Yeah, but you have\nthis interesting thing, you have a split between\nthe sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. - Right. - Right, and I'm using air\nquote for people listening to audio. I'm making quotes\nin the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can.\n- Yep. - One side has all the certified experts. The other side just has a\nbunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite\nknow how to explain it. And what was so unusual\nabout the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of Supreme Court, is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time, actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record, they actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, 'cause if you don't have\nexperts, what do you have? You know, something is wrong, but you have primarily\nan emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, you know, that\na certified expert can? And no, you can't, like, you\nknow, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. Yeah, and so it's just\nlike, all right, now, by the way, look, I think there are ways\nto square the circle, I think there's a way to\nhave our cake and eat it too, like I think there'd be\nmany ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with\nhigh-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is\nunder much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for\nuniversities to do that, they are still doing it,\nbut they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part, that's happening\nfor a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate\nlawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court\nrulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just as a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let add one more nuance to it that makes it even more complicated. - Yeah. - So the cliche is we're gonna\nbrain drain the world, right? You've heard that? We're gonna take all the smart people from all over the world,\nwe're gonna bring them here, we're gonna educate them, and\nthen we're gonna keep them, and then they're gonna\nraise their families here, create businesses here,\ncreate jobs here, right? - In the cliche, that's\na super positive thing. - Yeah. Okay, so what happens to\nthe rest of the world? - They lose? - Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious,\nhighly conscientious, highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that\nmany and they all come here and they all aren't where\nthey would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So it's almost impossible\nfor us here to have that conversation, in part because we become\nincredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just\nsimply all the same, which is a whole thing\nwe could talk about. But it also, we are purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the\nworld, not the other way around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow\nof high-skilled immigration over time, there's only\nfour permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration\nplaces people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. - Oh, Australia. - It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four\ncountries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk\nabout this I've discovered because the Eurozone\nis, whatever, you know, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over\ntime have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I\nthink it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've\nbeen migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this\nreally hit the fan was in Greece, right? So, you know, Greece falls\ninto chaos, disaster, and then, you know, you're\nrunning the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic\ndevelopment plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. Like, what are you gonna do, right? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. Not because, in part, because of this, 'cause we enthusiastically\nrecruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining\nUkraine for a long time. But also, of course,\nyou know, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, you know, when it comes\ntime for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it\ngonna have the talent base even that it had five years ago is like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, like\nwe have brain drained a lot of really smart people outta Russia, a lot of them are here, right? Over the last, you know, 30 years. And so there's this thing, it's actually really funny\nif you think about it. Like, the one thing that\nwe know to be the height of absolute evil that the\nWest ever did was colonization and resource extraction, right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and\nthe English and you know, everybody else went and had\nthese colonies and then went in and we, you know, took all the oil and we took all the diamonds,\nor we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason we realized\nthat's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's\ncompletely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious\nand beautiful and wonderful and you know, the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral\njustice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one\nsecond what we're doing to the countries that we're\npulling all these people out of. And this is one of these\nthings like, I don't know, like maybe we're just gonna live in this delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't care what happens, but like, I think there may come, this is like one of these submarines 10 feet under the waterline. Like, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly\nrealize, \"Oh, my God, what are we doing?\" 'Cause like, we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? Like we need these other\ncountries to like flourish. Like we don't wanna be the\nonly successful country in the middle of just like\ncomplete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and\nwe extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it. - Well, this is so deeply\nprofound, actually. So what is the cost\n\"winning\" quote, unquote, if these countries are drained\nin terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics,\nwhat does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually\nwant them to be strong in the way we understand\nstrong, not just in every way. So that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. - Yep. - It's interesting, this is one of those\ntruths where you just speak and it resonates, and I\ndidn't even think about it. - [Marc] Yeah, exactly. - So you were sitting\nduring the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that said-\n- Yeah. - There's still to use\nsome good to the H-1B? - Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's- - Come all the way around. (laughs) - There's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance,\nwhich is mostly the valley, we don't use H-1Bs anymore,\nmostly we use O-1s. So there's a separate class of these, and the O-1 is like this, it turns out the O-1 is\nthe super genius visa. So the O-1 is the basically our founder, like when we have somebody\nfrom anywhere in the world and they've like invented a\nbreakthrough new technology, and they wanna come to\nthe US to start a company, they come in through an O-1 visa. And that actually is like\na, it's a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, but it's like a pretty high\nbar. And they do a lot of work and there's like a, you have\nto put real work into it and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened\nwith the H-1B visa program is that it has gone to\nbasically two categories of employers. One is the basically a small\nset of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies\nthat you would think. And then the other is, it goes to these, they call kind of the mills,\nthe consulting mills, right? And so there's these set\nof companies with names, I don't wanna pick on\ncompanies, but you know, names like Cognizant that, you know, hire, basically have their business model is bring in primarily\nIndians in large numbers, and you know, they often have, you know, offices next to company-owned housing. And they'll have, you know,\norganizations that are, you know, they'll have,\nyou know, organizations that are literally thousands\nof Indians, you know, living and working in the US and they do basically call it\nmid-tier, like IT consulting. So you know, these folks,\nthey're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a year or $100,000 a year, not the, you know, 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, like in practice, the startups, basic like\nlittle tech as we call it, or the startup world,\nmainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point and mainly can't, 'cause the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of\nunderlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, you know, Amazon, like Amazon's a\nin like I love Amazon, but like they're a big powerful company. You know, they've got, you\nknow, more money than God. They've got resources, they've got long-term\nplanning horizon, they do big, you know, profound things over,\nyou know, decades at a time. You know, they could, you know, or any of these other companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you know, you'll\nnotice they don't do that. You know, they bring in, you know, 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, like,\nthere's lots of questions around them and whether\nthey should, you know, whether that's even a\nethical way to, you know, I don't wanna say they're\nunethical, but there's questions around like exactly what\nthe trade-offs are there. Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, you know, nobody\nreally wanted to be opened, you know, to play devil's\nadvocate on all this in terms of like national\nimmigration issues, you know, none of this is like a top end issue just 'cause the numbers are small, right? And so, you know, I don't think, you know, the administration has said like, this is not like a priority\nof theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is like, there is actually a lot of\ncomplexity and nuance here. I have a lot of friends,\nlike I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues\nwho are, you know, who came over on H-1Bs,\nor O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens and you know, every single\none that one of them was not every single one, a lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the honor of immigrants throughout\nthis whole period. And they said to me,\nit's like, \"Well, Marc, you know, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance\nof high-skilled immigration to the US?\" And I was like, I think\nyou can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent and be like, do you\nwanna inflame the issue or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right? And I think the answer\nis to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one\nmore positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up\non the university some more. Do you know about the National\nMerit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? - Not really, can you explain? - So there's a system that was\ncreated during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when... It was when people in\ngovernment actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an ideas that sounds today. And so it's basically a\nnational talent search for basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify\nbasically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of\nother characteristics. So there's no race, gender,\nor any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory\nSAT that you take, and then the SAT. So it uses those scores,\nthat is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. So they use the SAT as a\nproxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to like 1% of\nthe population of the kids, 18 year olds any given year\nwho scored highest on the PSAT, and then they get down to\nlike further qualify down to the 0.5% that also\nreplicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right? So it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the\nbest and the brightest. How many of our great and\npowerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities\nall have sports teams, they all have national scouting,\nthey have full-time scouts who go out and they go\nto every high school and they try to find all\nthe great basketball players and bring them into the\nNCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities\nuse the National Merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids\nand just bring them in? - Let me guess, very few. Zero.\n- Zero. (laughs) - As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that\nsame level of scouting for talent internally. - Go get the smartest ones. I'll give you one more\nkicker on this topic if I haven't beaten it to death. You know, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a\nhighly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like\nthe whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the\ncollege board that runs it. And it has been essentially\nlike everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so the in two ways, number one, it's been dumbed down where\nan 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost\nimpossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, right? And so, it's been\ndeliberately dumbed down. And then two is they have tried to pull out a lot of what's\ncalled the g-loading. And so they've tried to detach\nit from being an IQ proxy 'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable, right? So the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has\nreally started to work. And one of the things you\nsee is the Asian spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is\nbecause it's more coachable now. And the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the coaching\nthing is really difficult 'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents\ncan afford coaching, right? And I don't know about\nyou, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT\nwas until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. So, number one, there's issues there, but the other issue there is\nthink about what's happened by the dumbing down,\n800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It's like the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they\nhave AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. 'Cause what you want\nis you want, whatever, if it's gonna be 100,000\nkids, I don't know what it is, it's gonna be 50,000\nkids a year scoring 800. You also then want kids\nto be able to score 900 and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200, and you wanna ultimately get to, you know, you'd like to ultimately\nidentify the top 100 kids and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the\ntest has been reduced, so that it actually is\nnot useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption that's taken place\nthroughout this entire system where we have been heading\nin the reverse direction from wanting to actually go\nget the best and brightest and actually put them in the\nplaces where they should be. And then just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System\nis it's comp, like I said, it's completely race\nblind, it's gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic. It's only done on test scores. You know, and you can make\nan argument about whether that's good or bad, but\nit is, you know, for sure, you know, it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed\nmerit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose\nto do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it like incredibly striking and an enormous moral\nindictment of the current system that there are no universities\nthat do this today. So back to the immigration\nthing, just real quick. It's like, okay, we aren't even trying\nto go get the smart kids out of the center of-\n- Yeah. - And even if they think that they can get into these\nplaces, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for\nthe smart Black people. And like, it's just like,\nI don't know how, like, I don't know how that's moral. Like I don't get it at all. - As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times and I've always gotten\nperfect on math, 800. And I'm not that I'm not special like, it doesn't identify genius. I think you wanna search for genius and you wanna create\nmeasures that find genius of all different kinds,\nspeaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and\nover, defend immigrants. Yes. But say we should hire\nmore and more native-born. - Well, you asked me in the beginning like what's the most optimistic\nforecast, right, that we could have? And the most optimistic\nforecast would be, my God, what if we did both? (laughs) - So that's the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. - Well, it would diffuse the entire issue. - [Lex] Yeah. - If everybody in the center\nin the South of the country and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they\nwere getting a fair shake, like it would diffuse the issue. Like how about diffusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical... Sorry, I don't mean to really get out over my skis here, but- - I think your profile on X\nstates, \"It's time to build.\" It feels like 2025 is\na good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for\nanybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build\nsomething useful in the world or maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch\napps, services, whatever, ship software products. So maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? - So I mean, a big part\nof the answer I think is we're in the middle\nof a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking\nabout this on your show, but like AI coding, I mean,\nthis is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the investment of software. And I'm sure you, and you\nknow, we're involved in various of these companies, but\nyou know, these tools, you know, from a variety of companies are just like absolutely revolutionary and they're getting better by\nleaps and bounds every day. And you know, all this, but like the thing with coding, like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever. But like for sure, we\ncan make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate\nthe results of coding. And so, you know, there's all\nthese methods of, you know, synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is gonna get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean\nanybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and\nlook at AI coding demos, you know, little kids\nmaking apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. I mean I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary. You know, in a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain\nyourself, you know, start using these things, get\na huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more\nquickly than you could before. - That's actually a tricky\none in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like\nyou still need to learn how to code, it becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately\nbe a one person company and get quite far. - I agree with that, up to a point. So I think, for sure,\nfor quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are gonna be the best at\nactually having AI's code things, 'cause they're gonna understand\nwhat I mean, very basic. They're gonna understand\nwhat's happening, right? And they're gonna be able\nbe able to evaluate the work and they're gonna be able to, you know, literally like manage AIs better. Like even if they're not\nliterally handwriting the code, they're just gonna have\na much better sense of what's going on. So I definitely think\nlike 100% my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds of coding classes, and he'll keep doing that\nfor certainly through 18. We'll see after that. And so like for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you\ncan do with an AI is say, teach me how to code, right? And you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, I'll name names,\nyou know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing at\nKhan Academy for free. And then we, you know, we\nhave this company, Replit, which is was originally\nspecifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that's just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this and yeah, that, I mean, the\nAI's gonna be able to teach you to code, AI, by the way, is as you know, spectacularly good at\nexplaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools\nhave these features now where you can talk to the code base and so you can like literally like ask the code base\nquestions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and\npaste code into ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it\nwhat's going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so yeah, there's\ndozens of ways to do this. By the way, you can also, I mean even more broadly than code. Like, okay, you wanna make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art\ngeneration, sound generation, dialogue generation,\nvoice generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like,\nyou don't need designers, you know, you don't need, you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then, you know, a big is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's interfacing\ninto other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments\nor something like that. And, you know, AI's fantastic\nat writing glue code. So, you know, really,\nreally good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you\nfigure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write\na business plan for you. So it's just this, it's\nlike everything happening with AI right now, it's just, it's like this latent superpower and there's this incredible\nspectrum of people who have really figured out\nmassive performance increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't\neven aware it's happening. And there's some gearing to\nwhether you're a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races. And I think there are lots\nof professional coders who are still like, eh... You know, the blacksmiths were\nnot necessarily in favor of, you know, the car business. So yeah, there's the old\nWilliam Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just\nnot evenly distributed yet.\" And this is maybe the most\npotent version of that that I've ever seen. - Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" - Right.\n- It is very common. The programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true. I consider myself\nreasonably good programmer, and my productivity has\nbeen just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming\nis more efficient, more productive, more fun,\nall that kind of stuff. - I would also say code is, you know, code has of anything in\nlike industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the\neasier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's\nunlimited demand for code. Like, in other words, like\nthere's always some other idea for a thing that you can do,\na feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, like overwhelmingly, you know, the amount of code that\nexists in the world is a fraction of even\nthe ideas we have today. And then we come up with\nnew ideas all the time. And so I think that\nlike, (laughs) you know, I was in the late '80s, early '90s, when sort of automated\ncoding systems started to come out, expert systems,\na big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called the \"Decline and Fall of the\nAmerican Programmer,\" you know, that predicted that\nthese new coding systems were gonna mean we wouldn't\nhave programmers in the future. And of course, the number\nof programming jobs exploded by like a factor of 100. Like, my guess is we'll have\nmore coding jobs probably by like an order magnitude\n10 years from now. That will be different,\nthey'll be different jobs. They'll involve orchestrating\nAI, but there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry\nwill just explode in size. - Are you seeing the size\nof companies decrease in terms of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? - All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. - [Lex] Oh, for the big tech? - And little tech.\n- And little tech. - Everybody's trying to\nhire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it's 100%. I mean, there's a handful\nof company, you know, there's a little bit,\nthere's customer service, you know, we have some\ncompanies and others 'cause I think it's\nKlarna that's publicizing a lot of this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. But like for engineering jobs, like, it's just an explosion of hiring that at least, so far, there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am\nlooking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first\ncompany to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. So basically, the companies that we see are\nbasically one of two kinds. We see the companies that are basically sometimes\nuse weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies,\nI sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point\non whatever they're doing. - (laughs) Sure. - Right? And it's on the slide, right?\n- Yeah. - So they've got the, you know, whatever, da, da, da, da, da, and then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is, 'cause they had already\npreviously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the\nsix bullet point in the slide, which is how you're\ngetting all these products that have like the AI button\nup in the corner, right? The little sparkly button. - Yep.\n- Right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which\nI'm like, I don't need that. Like, I need you to answer\nmy email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay, so we see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then we see the strong\nform, which is the companies that are building from\nscratch for AI, right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally\nan AI email system, as an example, so just- - Oh, nice. I can't wait. - Yeah, they're gonna completely. So the very obvious idea,\nvery smart team, you know, it's gonna be great. And then, you know,\nNotion, just, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a\nproduct. And so now companies are gonna basically come through, sweep through, and they're gonna do\nbasically AI-first versions of basically everything. And those are like\ncompanies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. - Yeah, Cursor is an example of that. They basically said, okay,\nwe're gonna rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. - What if we knew from scratch\nthat we could build on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the Full Employment Act\nfor startups and VCs is, it just like if a\ntechnology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development\nprocess over from scratch, 'cause you need to\nreconceptualize the product, and then usually what that\nmeans is you need a new company 'cause most incumbents just won't do that. And so, yeah. So that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for is the\ncompany where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned\nas a result of AI, right? So I'm looking at, I'm\nwaiting for the company where it's like, no, we're\ngonna have, like, you know, and the cliche, here's a\nthought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're gonna have like the human executive team, and then we're gonna have the\ntheis be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of engineering\nsupervising 100 instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right by the way, or maybe the VP of\nengineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs, right? 'Cause one of the things that\nAI should be pretty good at is managing 'cause it's\nlike not, you know, it's like a process-driven,\nit's the kind of thing that AI's actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so should it be an AI executive team? You know, and then, of\ncourse, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, right? You know, and then maybe\nthe most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set\none of these things loose and let it basically\nbuild itself a business? And so I will say like\nwe're not yet seeing those, and I think there's a little bit of, the systems aren't quite\nready for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, like a founder who's really willing to break all the rules and\nreally willing to take the swing. And those people exist, and\nso I'm sure we'll see that. - And some of it is, as you\nknow, with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have\na AI-first email client, seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail\nis really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google\ncan't do it, because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer\nthe entirety of the system. 'Cause feels like Google's\nperfectly positioned to do it. Same with like, you have\nPerplexity, which I love, like Google could technically\ntake on Perplexity and do it much better,\nbut they haven't, not yet. So it's fascinating why\nthat is for large companies. I mean that is an\nadvantage for little tech, they could be agile. - Yeah, that's right.\n- They can move fast. - Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can't-\n- Right. - This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in\n\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which is sometimes when big\ncompanies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too much glass. It would specifically, it would interfere with\ntheir existing customers and their existing businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly,\nthey shouldn't do that, right? And so they just get, this is Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they're well-run, not\nbecause they're poorly run. But they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing against\nthe existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Like every once in a while, one breaks the pattern\nand actually does it. But for the most part, like this is a very predictable\nform of human behavior, and this fundamentally\nis why startups exist. - It feels like 2025 is\nwhen the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. Like, it's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI. Who do you think wins the AI race? - I would say, I'm not gonna predict, I'm gonna say there's\nquestions all over the place. And then we have this\ncategory question we call the trillion-dollar\nquestion, which is like, literally depending on how it's answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there's like, I don't know, 5 or $6 trillion questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I'll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small models. Another is open models\nversus closed models. Another is whether you can\nuse synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political\ntrillion-dollar questions. You know, policy\nquestions, which, you know, the US and the EU have both\nbeen flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is\nabout to really succeed at. Yeah, and then there's\nprobably another, you know, half dozen big important\nquestions after that. And so these are all just\nlike, say, this is an industry that's in flux in a way\nthat I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious\nexample of the flux is you know, sitting here\nless than three years ago, sitting here in December of '22, we would've said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today,\nit's like, you know, there's at least six, you know, world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of\nthe most shocking things to me, is like, it turns out that once\nyou know that it's possible to build one incredibly\nsmart Turning-test-passing large language model,\nwhich was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it\nturns out within, you know, a year, you can have five more. There's also a money\ncomponent thing to it, which is to get the money\nto scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There's basically right now\nonly two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers\ngiving you the money, which you turn around and\nroundtrip back to them. Or, you know, foreign\nsovereigns, other, you know, country sovereign wealth\nfunds, which can be, you know, difficult in some\ncases, for companies to access. So there's maybe another\ntrillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here's one. So Sam Altman has been\npublic about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a nonprofit,\nbeing a for-profit. The way that is legally done is that, and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and and other legal entities, government entities,\nscrutinizes very carefully, 'cause the US takes foundation\nnonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so the way that historically, the way that you do it\nis you start a for-profit and then you raise money\nwith the for-profit to buy the assets of the\nnonprofit at fair market value. And, you know, the last\nfinancing round at OpenAI was, you know, 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the\nflip is going to happen, the for-profit has to\ngo raise $150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. You know, raising 150\nbillion is a challenge. So, you know, is that even possible? If that is possible, then\nOpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, you know, I don't know. And then, you know,\nobviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the\nmarket leader today, you know, there's big important questions there. You know, Microsoft has this\nkind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind, but you know, they're\nvery good at catching up. Amazon, you know, is\nprimarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. - And then there's the other questions, like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly,\nopen versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. And then test on compute\nwith chain of thought. They're all of that. And it's just fascinating. And these are, I think it's fair to say,\ntrillion-dollar questions. - Yeah, these are big, like\nlook, you know, it's like, okay, here's a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations, right? Like, so if you are trying to\nuse these tools creatively, you're thrilled because\nthey can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this\nincredible stuff, right? They're creative. The flip side of that is if\nyou need them to be correct, they can't be creative. And that's, you know,\nthe term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And you know, there have been,\nyou know, court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court\ncitations, case citations. The judge is like, \"Wait a\nminute, this doesn't exist.\" And the very next is, \"Did\nyou write this yourself?\" And the lawyer goes, \"Er-\" (laughs) - I mean that's why with Elon, with Grok-\n- Yes. - Looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? - Yeah, that's right. And my sense is this very\ncontentious topic at the industry, my sense is if to the extent that there is a domain in\nwhich there is a definitive and checkable provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to\ngenerate synthetic data. You should be able to do\nchain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do\nreinforcement learning, and you should be able\nto ultimately, you know, eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that's a trillion-dollar\nquestion right there as to whether that's true. But then there's question of like, okay, is that gonna work in\nthe more general domain? Like, so for example, one\npossibility is these things are gonna get truly superhuman\nlike math and coding. But at like discussing\nphilosophy, they're gonna just, they're basically as smart\nas they're ever gonna be. And they're gonna be kind of, you know, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they're already outta training data. Like they literally, if, you know, you talk to these people,\nlike literally the big models, the big models are like\nwithin a factor of 2X of consuming all the\nhuman-generated training data to the point that some of these big companies are\nliterally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean\nthat like you have to, if you want your model\nto better philosophy, you have to go hire like\na thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody gonna do that? And so, you know, maybe these things are\ntopping out in certain ways and they're gonna leap\nway ahead in other ways. And so anyway, so we just\ndon't, you know, this is... Actually, maybe my main\nmain conclusion is, anybody telling, you know, anybody telling you these\nbig sweeping conclusions, you know, this whole super, you know, all of these abstract\ngeneralized super intelligence AGI stuff like, you know, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like, that's to abstract like,\nit's gotta actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have\nto be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem\nright now with the, you know, the big models that are like\nreally good at coding and math, they're like actually very\nexpensive to run, you know, they're quite slow. Another trillion-dollar\nquestion, future chips, which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean, all the global issue. Oh, another trillion-dollar\nquestion censorship, right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly, what are you\ntraining these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long did they give you these... How often do they give you these incredibly preaching moral lectures? Here's a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries\nwant their country to run its education system,\nhealthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing\nCalifornia politics, right? 'Cause that's kind of what\nthey have on offer right now. And I think the answer\nto that is not very many. So there's like massive\nopen questions there about like what, you know, and by\nthe way, like what morality of these things are gonna\nget trained on as a- - And that one we're cracking wide open with what's been happening\nover the past few months. Censorship on every\nlevel of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to be expand\nthe Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. - So what I experienced,\nyou know, going back to how we started, what I\nexperienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at like large scale, and then the war on the crypto\nindustry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared\nintent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under\nthe same kind of censorship and control regime as\nsocial media and the banks. And I think this election\ntipped, in America, I think this election\ntipped us from a timeline in which things were going to\nget really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are gonna be quite good. But look, those same questions\nalso apply outside the US and you know, the EU is doing their thing, they're being extremely draconian and they're trying to lock in\na political censorship regime on AI right now that's so harsh that even American AI\ncompanies are not even willing to launch new products\nin the EU right now. Like, that's not gonna last, but like, what happens there, right? And what are the trade-offs? You know, what levels of censorship are American companies\ngonna have to sign up for if they wanna operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them,\n(laughs) so that they can't? So big questions. - Quick questions. So you're very active on X. A very unique character, flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a meme, I\ndon't remember it exactly, but that Elon posted\nsomething like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I\nthink, you know, doing the, I take a big step back and\nfuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside\nyour mind when you're tweeting? - To be clear, a reference from the comedy\nclassic \"Tropic Thunder.\" - \"Tropic Thunder,\" yeah. Legendary movie. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Any Zoomers listening\nto this who haven't seen that movie, go watch it immediately. - Yeah, there's nothing\noffensive about it. - Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise's greatest performance. (Lex laughing) So-\n- Yeah. - Yeah, no, look, I should\nstart by saying like, I'm not supposed to be\ntweeting at all, so- - Yeah.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So, but, you know. - So how do you approach that? Like how do you approach what to tweet? - I mean, I don't. I don't well enough. It's mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there's a glory to it and there's an issue with it,\nand the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global\ncommunication, you know, X in particular is, you know, the town square on all these,\nyou know, social issues, political issues, everything\nelse, current events. But I mean, look, there's\nno question of the format. The format of at least\nthe original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I was tweeted something. It turned out that it's\nstill politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news\nin each time zone in India for a single tweet. So like, the single tweet outta context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously, X now has the\nmiddle ground where they, you know, they now have\nthe longer form essays. And so, you know, probably\nthe most productive thing I can do is longer form things. - You're not gonna do it though, are you? - [Marc] I do, I do,\nfrom time-to-time. I do. - Sometimes.\n- I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean,\nlook, but, and yeah, and obviously, X is doing great. And then, like I said,\nlike Substack, you know, has become the center for a\nlot, you know, a lot of the, I think the best kind of,\nyou know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly\nintellectual content, you know, tons of current events\nstuff there as well. And then, yeah, so, and then there's a bunch\nof other, you know, a bunch of new systems\nthat are very exciting. So I think one of the\nthings we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive\nreinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen with that. And it's happened on X, but it's now gonna happen\non other platforms. And then the other is crypto's gonna come right back to life. And actually that's\nvery exciting, actually, that's worth noting is that's another\ntrillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal\neconomic system for that, right? 'Cause it's a programmable money, it's a very easy way\nto plug in and do that. And there's this transaction\nprocessing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto\nAI intersection, you know, is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was gonna be\nimpossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do. - Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite\nthings about Yann LeCun? (Marc laughing) I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree\non a lot of things, but I personally like\nvigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the\ngladiators go at it, and- - No, he's a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn't\nsay we're super close, but you know, casual friends. I worked with him at Meta, you know, he is the chief scientist\nat Meta for a long time and is still, you know, works with us. And obviously is a legendary\nfigure in the field and one of the main people\nresponsible for what's happening. My serious observation would be that it's the thing I keep,\nI've talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does\nis he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree\nwith this, he is the smartest and most credible critic\nof LLMs is the path for AI. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's not, you know, there's certain, I would say troll-like characters who are just like crapping everything. But like Yann has like very\ndeeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. And I actually, like,\nI try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,\nI try to have a mental model of like the two different\nsides of a serious argument. And so I've tried to like\ninternalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult 'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like\nthat could be a big problem. But like, we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the\nbullish people, you know, to really kind of test\ntheir level of knowledge. So I like to kind of grill people. Like, you know, I was got\nmy CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like to the extent I can\nunderstand Yann's points, I can use them to, you know,\nto really surface a lot of the questions for the\npeople who are more bullish. And that's been, I think,\nvery, very productive. Yeah, just, and it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, who is actually like a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he\nwill provoke the evolution of these systems to be much\nbetter than they would've been. - Yeah, he could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the\nLLM path to AGI, you know, his basic notions that\nthere needs AI needs to have some physical understanding\nof the physical world, and that's very difficult\nto achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations\nof LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source.\n- Yes. - Which is a whole nother-\n- Yes. - Which you have been as well. - [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah. - And that's been just\nfascinating to watch. - [Marc] And anti-doomer. - Anti-doomer?\n- Yeah. - Yeah, he's-\n- He's very anti-doomer. - He embodies... He also has many wolves inside. - [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes, he does. Yes, does. - So it's been really,\nreally fun to watch. - The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. - [Lex] Yeah. - The other two of the\nthree godfathers of AI are like radicals, like full-on left, you know,\nfar left, you know, like, I would say like either\nMarxists or borderline Marxists. And they're like, I think, quite extreme in\ntheir social political views. And I think that feeds\ninto their doomerism, and I think, you know, they are lobbying for\nlike draconian government, I think what would be ruinously\ndestructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Yann as a\ncounterpoint to those two. - Another fun question, our\nmutual friend Andrew Huberman. - [Marc] Yes. - First maybe, what do you\nlove most about Andrew? And second, what score\non a scale of 1 to 10 do you think he would give you\non your approach to health? - Oh, three. - Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.\n- (laughs) Exactly. - That's good. (laughs)\n- Exactly. Well, so he convinced me\nto stop drinking alcohol, which was a big-\n- Successfully? - Well, it was like other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world.\n- Yeah. - And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night, it was like a major, like, it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly\nnegatively impacted my emotional health. (Lex laughing) I blame him-\n- Yeah. - For making me much\nless happy as a person. But much, much, much healthier. - Yeah.\n- Physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have no interest in\nhis sleep shit. Like, no. This whole light, natural light, no, we're not doing it. - You're too hardcore for this? - I don't see any natural light in here. - [Lex] It's all covered. It's all horrible. - And I'm very happy. I would be very happy\nliving and working here 'cause I'm totally happy\nwithout natural light. - In darkness.\n- Yes. - It must be a metaphor for something. - Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have\na blue screen in your face for three hours and\nthen go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why you should wanna take shortcuts. - I now understand what they\nmean by toxic masculinity. All right. (both laughing) So let's see. You're exceptionally\nsuccessful by most measures, but what to you is the\ndefinition of success? - I would probably say it is\na combination of two things, I think it is contribution. So, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately, you know, and specifically\nit mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not\nmean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said, \"Pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to\nsatisfaction or fulfillment. And so I think about happiness as the first ice cream\ncone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice\ncream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of\nthe walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Right, and so happiness is\nthis very fleeting concept, and the people who\nanchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I dunno how to put it useful. - So that's a good place\nto arrive at in life. - Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah. You know, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But like, if you're sitting in a room by yourself and you're like, all right. Or you know, four in the\nmorning, it's like, all right, have I lived up to my\nexpectation of myself? Like if you have, you know,\nthe people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and, you know, generally seem\nvery, I dunno how to put it, pleased with, you know,\nproud, calm, at peace. The people who are, you\nknow, sensation seekers, you know, some of the sensations\nby the way, some sense, you know, there's certain\nentrepreneurs, for example, who are like into every\nform of extreme sport and they get, you know, huge\nsatisfaction out of that. Or, you know, there's sensation seeking in sort of useful and productive ways. You know, Larry Ellison\nwas always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, there's\na lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know,\ndrugs, (laughs) you know, like you know, sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun\nat first and then backfire. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM- - [Marc] Yeah.\n- And I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM- - Yeah.\n- With a blue screen. - That's good. Exactly. - Staring at cursor.\n- Exactly. - As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an\namazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and\njust to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called,\n\"Honestly, with Bari Weiss.\" She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys... See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. - [Marc] Thank you. - So this question is designed for many of the questions today\nwere designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause\nthat you're not sure. So it felt like the\npause, the uncertainty, there was some kind of\nongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching\nfor wisdom and meaning? - I guess I'd put it this way. There's a lot to just\nunderstand about people that I feel like I'm only\nstarting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler\nconcept than God. (laughs) So that's what I've spent a\nlot of the last, you know, 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my\nfirst like whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I'm spending 30\nyears figuring out people, which turns out to be quite\na bit more complicated. And then, I don't know,\nmaybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look,\nI mean just, you know, like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is like\nvery, you know, complicated and, you know, mystifying. I mean, every time I, you\nknow, pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, you know, \"Daddy, how many galaxies\nare there in the universe?\" And you know, how many galaxies are\nthere in the universe? - 100 billion?\n- Okay. Like how? (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - Like-\n- Yeah. - Like how that freaking possible? Like it's such a\nstaggering concept that I- - I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from\nElon from a while back. Elon, said, \"As a friend called it, this\nis the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies, a billion light years across.\"\n- Yeah. - So these are all galaxies.\n- Yeah. Like how was it that big? Like how the hell, and like, you know, I can read the textbook\nand the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion\nyears and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all\nrights, the Big Bang. All right, like what was\nbefore the Big Bang? (laughs) - Do you think we humans will\never colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? - Sure. Yeah, I mean,\nin the fullness of time. Yeah. - So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across a thousand of-\n- In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah, you know, all the problem, all the\nchallenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it'll take a long time. - You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? - No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately\nwe have Elon giving us, (Lex laughing) giving us the backup plan. So I don't know, like,\nI grew up, you know, real Midwest, sort of\njust like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an\nengineer and a scientist. I'm like, \"Oh, that definitely\ndoesn't make sense.\" I'm like, \"I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll figure everything out.\" And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against\nthese things, you know, you bump up against these things and you're just like, \"All right,\" I like, \"Okay, I guess there's\na scientific explanation for this, but like, wow.\" And then there's like, \"All right, where did that come from?\" Right, and then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean,\nand even just, you know, experiences that we all have on earth, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, I guess I just say I'm kind\nof radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that\nI'll probably never know. The other thing though, that's happened, and maybe the more practical\nanswer to the question is I think I have a much\nbetter understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great... I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, \"If a man does\nnot have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\" And so there's this class,\nit's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing\npoint of view, which is, \"Yes, I'm an atheist,\nbut it's very important that the people believe in something.\" Right? And Marx had like the\nnegative view on that, which is religions the\nopiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like\nright-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it's deeply important that the people be Christian\nor something like that. And on the one hand it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right because, you know, what have we learned in the last 100 years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's\nthis political philosopher who's super interesting on\nthis named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the sort\nof mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was like born in, I think, like 1900, and like died in like '85. So he saw the complete run\nof communism and Nazism and himself, you know, I think he fled Europe and\nyou know, the whole thing. And you know, his sort of\nbig conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but like in the deep way of religions. Like, you know, we call\n'em political religions, but they were like actual religions. And you know, they were\nwhat Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, \"God is dead. We've killed him, and we won't\nwash the blood off our hands for 1,000 years,\" right? Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just\nmass murder and death. And like, you read his stuff now and you're like, \"Yep,\n(laughs) that happened.\" Right? And then, of\ncourse, as fully, you know, elite moderates, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing\nthat for ourselves right now, but of course, we are. And you know, I would argue\nthat Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the\nlast 10 years, you know, we have been in a\nreligious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full\nscale religious frenzy and has had all of the\ncharacteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to, you know, sin. Wokeness has said, every, I think, has said every single aspect of an actual religion other\nthan redemption, right? Which is maybe like the\nmost dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's\nno forgiveness, right? And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would've\nzeroed right in on that, would've said that. And, you know, we just\nlike sailed right off. I mentioned earlier like\nwe somehow rediscovered the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity\npolitics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, like there is\nsomething very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and\nneeds to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles\nwith the specifics of it. - I think I speak for a lot of people that it's been a real joy and for me, an honor to get to\nwatch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You're in that 30-year part of your life, and it's been an honor\nto talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That's only, how long is that? - Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so- - I'll accept being one of the short ones. (both laughing) - For the listener. Marc looks like he's ready\nto go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. (laughs) Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen.

And then if this doesn't\nget fixed, at some point, we enter a hyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil and- - The following is a conversation\nwith Marc Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. Marc is a visionary\ntech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the\ntech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential\nvoices in the tech world, including at the intersection\nof technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the\nbest possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small\ntech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario\ntrajectory for America. - The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.\n- The roaring '20s. I mean, look, couple things. It is remarkable over\nthe last several years with all of the issues\nincluding, you know, not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every\nother thing that's happened. It's really amazing, the United\nStates just kept growing. If you just look at\neconomic growth charts, the US just kept growing,\nand very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing,\nGermany has stopped growing, and you know, some of those countries may be actually growing\nbackwards at this point. And there's a very long\ndiscussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's of course, plenty of things that are\nwrong with our country, but the US is just flat\nout primed for growth. And I think that's a consequence\nof many factors, you know, some of which are lucky and\nsome of which through hard work. And so the lucky part is\njust, you know, number one, you know, we just have like\nincredible physical security by being our own continent. You know, we have incredible\nnatural resources, right? There's this running joke now that like, whenever it looks like\nthe US is gonna run out of some like rare earth\nmaterial, you know, some farmer in North Dakota\nlike kicks over a hay bale and finds like a $2 trillion deposit. Right, I mean, we're just like blessed, you know, with geography\nand with natural resources. Energy. You know, we can be energy\nindependent anytime we want. This last administration\ndecided they didn't wanna be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has\ndeclared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There's no question we\ncan be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It's purely a question of choice, and I think the new\nadministration's gonna do that. And oh, and then I would\nsay two other things. One is, you know, we\nare the beneficiaries, and, you know, you're an example of this. We're a beneficiary. We're the beneficiary of,\nyou know, 50, 100, 200 years of like the basically\nmost aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people, you know, moving to the US and\nraising their kids here. And so we just have, you know, we're by far the\nmost dynamic population, most aggressive. You know, we're the most\naggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country, and have been for a long\ntime, and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the\nadvanced technology leader. You know, we have our\nissues and we have a... I would say particular\nissue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for, you know, anything\nin software, anything in AI, anything in, you know,\nall these, you know, advanced biotech, all these\nadvanced areas of technology, like we're by far the leader. Again, in part 'cause many\nof the best scientists and engineers in those fields, you know, come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for a just a monster boom. You know, I could see\neconomic growth going way up. I could see productivity\ngrowth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a\nglobal tour, if you like, but like, basically, all of our competitors\nhave like profound issues and, you know, we could kind\nof go through them one by one, but the competitive\nlandscape just is, it's like, it's remarkable how much better positioned\nwe are for growth. - What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical questions. You know, I travel across the world and there's something\nabout the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be\nthe Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? - Yeah. So is this a family\nshow or am I allowed to swear? - You could say whatever\nthe fuck you want. - (laughs) Okay. So the great TV show, \"Succession,\" the show, of course, which\nyou were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.\n- Yes. - The best line from \"Succession\"\nwas in the final episode of the first season\nwhen the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral\nhomeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle,\nyou know, for some wedding. And Logan is just like\ncompletely miserable, have to having to, you know, 'cause he is been in\nNew York for 50 years, he's totally miserable\nbeing back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here and go back to America where\nwe can fuck without condoms.\" (both laughing) - Was that a metaphor or... Okay.\n- Exactly. Right. And so no, but it's exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what, like-\n- Yeah. - Everybody watching that\ninstantly starts laughing 'cause you know what it means,\nwhich it's exactly this. I think there's like an\nethnographic, you know, way of it. There's a bunch of\nbooks on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all\nthe different derivations of all the different ethnic\ngroups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. Right, and what we have is\nthis sort of amalgamation of like, you know, the\nNortheast, you know, Yankees who are like super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are\nsuper aggressive, you know, we've got the, you know, the Southerners and the Texans, you know, and you know, the sort of, you\nknow, whole kind of blended, you know, kind of\nAnglo-Hispanic thing, you know, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, you know, capable characters. You know, the Texas Rangers,\nyou know, we've got the, yeah, we've got the California, you\nknow, we've got the, you know, the wild, we've got the\nincredibly, you know, inventive hippies, but we also\nhave the hardcore engineers. We've got, you know, the best, you know, rocket scientists in the world. We've got the best, you\nknow, artists in the world, you know, creative professionals,\nyou know, the best movies. And so yeah, there is, you know, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, you\nknow, in my view to some extent, you know, attempts to\nbasically sand all that off and make everything basically\nboring and mediocre. But there is something\nin the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just\nneed people to stand up at a certain point and say, you know, \"It's time to build, it's time to grow, you know,\nit's time to do things.\" And there's something\nin the American spirit that just like roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I actually saw, you know, I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s, you know, 'cause the '70s were like horribly depressing, right? In the US. Like they were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has\nfelt a lot like the '70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating,\nyou know, negative attitude and everybody's upset about everything. And, you know, and then by\nthe way, like energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization, right? You know, the low point for\nin the '70s was, you know, Jimmy Carter who just passed away. He went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech. And it was like the weakest possible, trying to like rouse people\nback to a sense of like passion, he completely failed. And, you\nknow, we had the, you know, the hostages in, you know,\nIran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly\nnews, it was, you know, lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then, you know, Reagan came in and, you know, Reagan was a\nvery controversial character at the time, and, you know, he came in\nand he is like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're gonna do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and, you know, roared really\nhard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what... I think, you know, we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. - And I just did a super long\npodcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible\nprofessor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic.\n- Yes. - And one of which maybe\nyou can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual\nfreedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just\nin general, individualism. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and as you know this, America has this incredible\nstreak of individualism, you know, individualism in\nAmerica probably peaked, I think between roughly call\nit the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably\ncall it 1931 or something, you know, and there was\nthis like incredible rush. I mean, that period, you know, we now know that period as the\nSecond Industrial Revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then, you know, that led to, you know, ultimately then therefore\nbeing able to, you know, not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II\nand then win the Cold War. And yeah, you know, massive\nindividualistic streak. By the way, you know,\nMilton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring.\n- Yep. - As they were then, you know, he is a singular figure and many of us, you\nknow, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of\npeople who worked with him and you know, he was a singular figure, but all of his lessons, you know, live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's\nnot just individualism, and this is, you know, this\nis one of the big things, it's like playing out\nin a lot of our culture and kind of political fights\nright now, which is, you know, basically this feeling, you\nknow, certainly that I have and I share with a lot\nof people, which is, it's not enough for America\nto just be an economic zone. And it's not enough for\nus to just be individuals, and it's not enough to\njust have line go up, and it's not enough to\njust have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also, you know,\nthere's more to a country than just that. And you know, quite frankly,\na lot of it is intangible. A lot of it is, you know,\ninvolve spirit and passion. And you know, like I said, we have more of it than\nanybody else, but, you know, we have to choose to want it. The way I look at, it's\nlike all of our problems are self-inflicted. Like, you know, decline is a choice. You know, all of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, you know, basically people telling us, people in positions of\nauthority telling us that, you know, \"We shouldn't,\nyou know, stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous,\nwe shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, you know, we shouldn't this,\nthat, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about\neverything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think\npeople are done with it. - If we could go on a\ntangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book \"The Ancient City.\"\n- Yes. - By, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa\nDenis Fustel de Coulanges, I don't know. - That was amazing. - Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said, this is an\nimportant book to understand who we are and where we come from. - So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by\nthis guy as a (indistinct). I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language\npronunciations for the day. He was a professor classics\nat the Sorbonne in Paris, you know, the top university,\nactually in the 1860s, so actually, right around\nafter the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a\nparticular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the\nbook as he had apparently read, and, you know, sort of absorbed and memorized every\npossible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about\nGreek and Roman culture, and that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none\nof that has changed, right? And so he had access to the\nexact same written materials that we have access to, and you know, we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he\ndid is he went back further. He reconstructed the people\nwho came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their\nlife and society was like. And these were the\npeople who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you\nmay have heard of these are the people who came\ndown from the steppes. And so they came out of what's\nnow like Eastern Europe, like around sort of the\noutskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of\nswept through Europe. They ultimately took over\nall of Europe, by the way, you know, almost many of the\nethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years\nthat follow, you know, are Indo-European. And so like, you know, they were this basically this warrior, basically class that like\ncame down and swept through and you know, essentially, you know, populated much of the world. And there's a whole\ninteresting saga there. But what he does, and then they basically, from there came basically\nwhat we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind\nof evolutions off of that. And so what he reconstructs\na sort of what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind\nof original social state. And the significance of that\nis the original social state is this is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no\ntechnology, (laughs) right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got the clothes on your back, you've got your, you know, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you know, predates\nbasically all concepts of technologies as we\nunderstand 'em today. And so these are people\nunder like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social\npatterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern\nbasically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero\nconcept of individual rights and essentially no\nconcept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set\nof tribes would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what\nNietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality,\nanything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it's very clear why that is, right? It's 'cause strong equals\ngood equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is it more important\nfor you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, you know, live as a slave on your\nknees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted\nthat moral framework. But it, you know, the\noriginal framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally\nobligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. (laughs) Right, you were morally required to. Like, if you didn't do\nit, you were a bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time\nwith no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives\nis that it's a collective you know, and people are\nsharing and of course, that limited how big they could get 'cause you know, the\nproblem with communism is it doesn't scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it\nwork at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately\ntied into their religion. And their religion was,\nit was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors\nis extremely important because it was basically the\nancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the\npeople who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of nature 'cause of course, nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city\nhad their ancestor gods, and then they had their nature gods. Okay, so fast-forward to today, like we live in a world that\nis like radically different, and the book takes you\nthrough kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans, through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because\nthe conventional view of the progress through time\nis that we are, you know, the cliche is the arc of the\nmoral universe, you know, bend towards justice, right? Or so-called wig history,\nwhich is, you know, that the arc of progress\nis positive, right? And so, you know, what\nyou hear all the time, what you're taught in school\nand everything is, you know, every year that goes by,\nwe get better and better and more and more moral\nand more and more pure and a better version of ourselves, our Indo-European ancestors would say, \"Oh, no, like you people\nhave like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically your civilization, and you have diluted\nthem down to the point where they barely even matter. You know, and you're having, you know, children outta a wedlock and you're, you know, you\nregularly encounter people of other cities and you\ndon't try to kill them.\" And like, how crazy is that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an\nincredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious,\nhighly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can't resist noting\nthat as a consequence of basically going through\nall the transitions we've been through, going all the way through\nChristianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We're in a secular society,\nyou know, that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but you know, largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved,\nmodern secular, you know, expert, scientists and so\nforth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact\nsame religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had,\nspecifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics\nand nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, worked our way all the way\nback to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show\nthat like, you know, in some ways we have fallen\nfar from the family tree, but in some cases, we're exactly the same. - You kind of described this\nprogressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. - Identity politics is\nworshiping ancestors, right?\n- Yeah. - It's tagging newborn\ninfants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've\nrecognized it on sight. We somehow think it's like\nsuper socially progressive. - Yeah. And it is not. - I mean, I would say obviously not. You know, get nuanced, which\nis where I think you're headed, which is look like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent\nsociety every generation, and have no regard whatsoever\nfor what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea, right? That's like the Cambodians\nwith Year Zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up\neverything that came before and create something new\nin the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing, you know,\nenormous destruction. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, there is like a deeply\nimportant role for tradition. And the way I think\nabout that is the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And you know, this is what\nIndo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled\nwisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and\npowerful lessons learned. And that's why I think\nit's fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is 'cause that's part of the history and you know, part of the learning that got us to where we're today. Having said that, there are\nmany cultures around the world that are, you know, mired\nin tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that's the default human\ncondition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in\nsocieties in which, you know, there's like absolute\nseniority by age, you know, kids are completely... You know, like in the\nUS, like for some reason, we decided kids are in\ncharge of everything, right? And like, you know,\nthey're the trendsetters and they're allowed to\nlike, set all the agendas and like set all the politics\nand set all the culture and maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. 'Cause it's the old\npeople who are in charge of everything, you know,\nthey're gerontocracies, and it's all a bunch of\n80-year-olds running everything, which by the way, we have a\nlittle bit of that too, right? And so what I would say is like, there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is\ncommunitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you\nknow, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, I mean, it just\ndoesn't get you anywhere. Like, it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a society living\nin the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in\nall the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, you know, I think it probably, this is one of those things\nwhere extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. - So the beautiful picture you\npainted of the roaring '20s, how can the Trump\nadministration play a part in making that future happen? - Yeah, so look, a big part of this is getting the government\nboot off the neck of the American economy, the\nAmerican technology industry, the American people. You know, and again, this\nis a replay of what happened in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know, for what started out looking\nlike, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you\nknow, we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I describe as sort of a\nform of soft authoritarianism. You know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's not like, you know, you\nget thrown into Lubyanka. You know, for the most part, it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know,\nincredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vetocracy, right? What's required to get anything done? You know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything,\nany one of them can veto it. You know, there's a lot of (indistinct)\npolitical system works. And then, you know, just this\ngeneral idea of, you know, progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses\nis bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome,\nyou know, basically anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. Anybody who's wrong\nabout anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this\nvery kind of, you know, grinding repression. And then coupled with\nspecific government actions such as censorship regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, you know, critical American industries and then, you know,\ncongratulating yourselves on the back for doing it, or, you know, having these\nhorrible social policies, like let's let all the\ncriminals outta jail and see what happens, right? And so, like we've just\nbeen through this period, you know, I call it a\ndemoralization campaign. Like we've just been through\nthis period where, you know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being\nthis comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible\nand if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration\nreached kinda the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many\nfronts at the same time. And so just like relieving that and getting kind of back\nto a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic,\nconstructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind,\nthere's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is gonna, I think,\ncause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of\nthings proactively that, yeah. And then there's a lot\nof things proactively that could be done. - So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically\npermeated government and permeated big companies? - Disclaimer at first, which is I don't wanna predict\nanything on any of this stuff 'cause I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics\nor Washington at all. But I would just say that\nthe plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration\nand that they plan to take, you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're gonna do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they're gonna do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they're gonna move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. Like, I mean, you know, we just saw a great example\nof this with what, you know, with what Mark Zuckerberg\nis doing, you know, and obviously I'm\ninvolved with his company, but you know, we just saw it\nkind of in public, the scope, and speed of the changes, you know, are reflective of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry, right? And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump\nor anti-Trump, like, there's just like a giant vibe shift mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a\ngroup of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still, you know, people who at least vocally\nwere still very anti-Trump, but I said, you know, \"Has anything changed since November 6th?\" And they immediately said, \"Oh, it's completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. You know, woke is over.\" You know, they said that\nall kinds of projects are gonna be able to get\nmade now they couldn't before that, you know, Hollywood's gonna start\nmaking comedies again. You know, like, they were just, just like an incredible\nimmediate environmental change. And as I talk to people kind\nof throughout, you know, certainly throughout the economy,\npeople who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which\nis just this last 10 years of misery is just over. I mean, the one that I'm\nwatching that's really funny. I mean, Facebook's getting a lot, Meta's getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is\nBlackRock, which I'm not, you know, and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so, you know, the Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock was like first in as a major, you know, investment CEO on like\nevery dumb social trend and rule set, like every... All right, I'm going for it.\nEvery retardant, (laughs) every retarded thing you can imagine.\n- Yeah. - Every ESG and every, like, every possible saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed\nideological positions. And, you know, he was coming\nin, he literally was like, had a aggregated together\ntrillions of dollars of shareholdings that he did not, you know, that were his customer's rights. And he, you know, seized\ntheir voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been like backpedaling\nfrom that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example, last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, you know, he pulled out\nof the crazy energy stuff. And so, like, you know, he's\nbacking away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard\nPryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where\nhe could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (Lex laughing) (laughs) And so, you know,\neven there doing that, and just the whole thing, I mean this, I dunno if you saw the court\nrecently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of\ndirectors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel\nand I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional\nattorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight\nface that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who\nliterally wrote a book called \"The Diversity Myth.\"\n- Yeah. - And he literally looked\nlike he'd swallowed a live goldfish and that-\n- Yeah. - And this was imposed, I mean, this was like so\nincredibly offensive to him that like, it was just\nabsolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (Lex laughing) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange\nimposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that, you know, so like these things basically are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other\nside of it is basically, you know, finally being able\nto get back to, you know, everything that, you know,\neverybody always wanted to do, which is like, run their\ncompanies, have great products, have happy customers,\nyou know, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society. - It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. - Well, so it was very, you\nknow, there was a moment. So you know, Peter, of course, you know, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but you know, there are other\nmen on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it,\nand we're like, all right, like, okay, LGBT, and we keep\ncoming back to the B, right? And it's like- (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - You know, it's like-\n- All right. - You know, I'm willing to do\na lot for this company, but- (both laughing) - It's all about sacrifice for diversity. - Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay,\nlike is there a test? - Right.\n- Right. You know, so.\n(Lex laughing) - Oh, yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? - [Marc] The questions\nthat got asked, you know. - What are you willing to do-\n- Yeah, and- - The greater good? - I've become very good at asking lawyers\ncompletely absurd questions with a totally straight face. - And do they answer with a\nstraight face, like lawyers- - Sometimes.\n- Okay. - I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. - So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon\nValley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to\npreference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? Like what percent of them\nare feeling this vibe shift and are interested in\ncreating the roaring '20s in the way they've described? - So first, we should\nmaybe talk population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley and the way to just measure that is just look at\nvoting records, right? And what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically, my entire time there has\nbeen overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that\nis political donation records. And again, you know,\nthe political donations in the Valley, you know,\nrange from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. And so, you know, I just\nbring it up 'cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there\nis a very big question of what's happening in\nLos Angeles right now. I don't wanna get into the fire, but like, it's catastrophic. And, you know, there was\nalready a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people\nin LA are really thinking about things right now as\nthey're trying to, you know, literally save their houses\nand save their families. But, you know, even in San Francisco, you know, there was a big shift\nto the right in the voting in '24. So, we'll see where\nthat goes, but you know, you observe that by just looking\nat the numbers over time. The part that I'm more\nfocused on is, you know, and I don't know how to\nexactly describe this, but it's like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people, right? You know, and I don't have a list, but like, you know, it's\nall the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top\nengineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, you know, the people who kind of\nbuilt and run the companies. And they're, you know,\nI don't have numbers, but I have a much more\ntactile feel, you know, for what's happening. So the big thing I have\nnow come to believe is that the idea that people\nhave beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most\nhigh-status people just go along. And I think maybe the\nmost high-status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the\nmost focused on status. And the way I would\ndescribe that is, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the\nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely\ninteresting articulation. You know, he was an\ninsane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. (both laughing) But-\n- Shots fired, man. - But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing\nwhere he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that's just stuck in my\nmind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept, you just called over-socialization. And so, you know, most\npeople are socialized, like most people are, you\nknow, we live in a society, most people learn how\nto be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There's something about\nmodern Western elites where they're over-socialized and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, you know, think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little\nbit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence\nof where I grew up. Like even before I had the\nviews that I have today, there was always just this\nweird thing where it's like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree\non every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in The New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? (laughs) Right? But why does everybody like\nsnap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I\ncame to Silicon Valley, and it's just as true\ntoday 30 years later. And so I think most\npeople are just literally, I think they're taking their cues from, it's some combination of\nthe press, the universities, the big foundations. So basically, it's like\nThe New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and you know, I don't\nknow, you know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and you know, maybe the President if\nyour party is in power. And like, whatever that is, everybody who's sort of\ngood and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the\ntwo interesting things about that is, number one, there's no divergence among\nthe organs of power, right? So Harvard and Yale believed\nthe exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believed the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and\nthe Rockefeller Foundation believed the exact same thing. Google, and, you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believed the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there's never conflict\nin the moment, right? And so, you know, The New York Times and The Washington Post\nagreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the\nspecifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically, we in the valley, we're\non the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood's\non the tail end of that, in the same way New York's\non the tail end of that, the same way the media's\non the tail end of that. It's like some sort of\ncollective hive mind thing. And I just go through that to say like, I don't think most people in my orbit, or you know, let's say the top\n10,000 people in the Valley, or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're sitting\nthere thinking basically, I have rocks... I mean, they probably think\nthey have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core\nof rocks solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch\nreality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they\nconform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time, they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd. - Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that, there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking to\npeople really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens\nat the dinner parties? Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four\npeople who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the\nmind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention\nwithin New York Times with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that\novertook Marc Andreessen's face. - So look, I'll just\ntell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences,\nno, there's none of that. What there is that all of the\nheretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation is either\ndiscussed a one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real-life social network. There's a secret handshake,\nwhich is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like\nknow each other a little bit, but like not well. And like you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to\nthe other person openly or whether you have to\nlike be fully conformist. It's a joke. - Well, yeah, humor- - [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke.\n- Yep. - If the other person laughs,\nthe conversation is on. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - If the other person doesn't laugh, back slowly away from the scene, (laughs) I didn't mean anything by it. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then by the way, it\ndoesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke\nthat's just up against the edge of one of the, use the\nSam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. You know, it has to be up\nagainst one of the things, you know, one of the things\nthat you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point,\nwhat happens is you have a peer-to-peer network, right? You have a one-to-one\nconnection with somebody, and then you have your own, your little conspiracy\nof a thought criminality, and then you've probably\nbeen through this, you have your network\nof thought criminals, and then they have their\nnetwork of thought criminals, and then you have this\nlike delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together, right? - And the fundamental mechanism\nof the dance is humor. - Yeah, it's humor like it, right? Well, of course.\n- Memes. Yeah. - Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor's a way\nto have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss\nserious thing without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right? So that's part of it, which is one of the reasons\nwhy comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can't. 'Cause, you know, they\ncan always fall back on, oh, yeah, I was just going for the laugh.\n- Yeah. - But the other key\nthing about humor, right? Is that laughter's involuntary, right? Like, you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision whether you're gonna laugh. And everybody can tell when\nsomebody's fake laughing, right? And this, every professional\ncomedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something truthful. Like, people don't laugh at\nlike, made-up bullshit stories. They laugh 'cause like\nyou're revealing something that they either have not\nbeen allowed to think about or have not been allowed\nto talk about, right? Or is off limits. And all of a sudden,\nit's like the ice breaks and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny and like I laugh, and then, of course,\nthis is why, of course, live comedy is so powerful is 'cause you're all doing\nthat at the same time, so you start to have, you\nknow, the safety of numbers. And so the comedians have like the all, it's no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has\nbeen as successful as he has 'cause they have this\nhack that the, you know, the rest of us who are\nnot professional comedians don't have, but you have\nyour in-person version of it. Yeah, and then you've got the question of whether you can sort of\njoin the networks together. And then you've probably\nbeen to this is, you know, then at some point\nthere's like a different, there's like the alt dinner party, the (indistinct) dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are like the happiest\nmoments of everybody's lives, 'cause they're just like,\neverybody's just ecstatic, 'cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed, like for every third sentence that comes outta my mouth, and we can actually\ntalk about real things. So that's the live version of it. And then, of course, the other\nside of it's the, you know, the group chat phenomenon, right? And then basically the same\nthing played out, you know, until Elon bought X and until\nSubstack took off, you know, which were really the\ntwo big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute\nconformity on the social networks, like literally enforced by\nthe social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through\ncancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming, right? But then group chats grew\nup to be the equivalent of samizdat, right? Anybody who grew up in the\nSoviet Union under, you know, communism, note, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It is like, how do you\nknow who you could talk to? And then how do you\ndistribute information? And like, you know, again, that was the hard\nauthoritarian version of this. And then we've been living\nthrough this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, with\nsome of the same patterns. - And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient\nto build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. - Yeah, exactly. Well,\nand this is the thing, and well, this is kind of the running joke about groups, right? The running kind of\nthing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, every group chat, if you've noticed this like, this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up\nbeing about memes and humor. And the game of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable. - [Lex] Yeah. - As you can get without\nactually tripping it, right? And like literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest\nwhere, but it's walking, they walk right up the line\nand they're constantly testing. And every once in a while\nsomebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, \"Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, we gotta wait until\nnext year to talk about that.\" You know, they walk it back. And so it's that same thing, and yeah. And then group chats is a\ntechnological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. 'Cause basically, it was number one, it was, you know, obviously\nthe rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of\nthe new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination\nof WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is\nthose were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough, I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably\nfour or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages,\nI think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of the\ndisappearing messages, right? And so it's like, you know, I\noften get behind on my thing, so I set to seven-day, you\nknow, disappearing messages and my friends who, you know, are like, no, that's way too much risk. - Yeah.\n- It's gotta be a day. And then every once in a\nwhile somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something\nlike particularly inflammatory. - Yeah, 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that\nbothers me about WhatsApp, the choices between 24 hours\nand, you know, seven days, one day or seven days.\n- (laughs) Right. - And I have to have an existential crisis about deciding.\n- Yes. - Whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Now, of course,\nwhat's happening right now is the big thaw, right? And so the vibe shift. So what's happening on the\nother side of the election is, you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the\ncontinued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new\nplatforms that are emerging. You know, like I think\nit may be, you know, I don't know that everything\njust shifts back into public, but like a tremendous amount\nof the verboten conversations, you know, can now shifts\nback into public view. And I mean, quite frankly,\nthis is one of those things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those, you know, what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like\nnet better for society that those things happen in\npublic instead of private. You know, do you really want, like, yeah. Like does she wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it's just, look, it's just I think,\nclearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. - I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea\nthat we're talking about. I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction\nof people have that? To me, the preference falsification\nis really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? 'Cause like that the dynamical system that is the difference between\nthose two is fascinating. Like, throughout history, the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting, 'cause everybody was following, you know, the line until not.\n- Right. - But for sure, privately,\nthere was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where like this is the\nbureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really\nbothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden, there's a trigger that allows\nthe vibe shift to happen. To me, like the interesting\nquestion here is, what is the landscape of\nprivate thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how\nmuch dormant energy is there for this roaring '20s? What people are like, no more\nbullshit, let's get shit done. - Yeah, so we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- - [Lex] Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly, this is one\nof the all-time great books. Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book, but it's completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply\nhistorically informed. So it's called \"Private\nTruths, Public Lies.\" And it's written by a social science\nprofessor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his\na definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls preference falsification. And so preference\nfalsification is two things, preference falsification... And you get it from the title of the book, \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So preference falsification\nis when you believe something and you can't say it, or/and this is very important,\nyou don't believe something and you must say it, right? And the commonality there is\nin both cases, you're lying. You believe something internally, and then you're lying about it in public. And so the thing, you know, and there's sort of the\ntwo classic forms of it. There's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe\ncommunism is rotten, but I can't say it version of it. But then there's also the famous parable of the real-life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good\nbook on this topic, which is \"The Power of the Powerless,\" you know, who is an\nanti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the, you know, the president Czechoslovakia\nafter the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book, and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of\nthe world unite, right? And so he describes what he calls the parable of the greengrocer, which is your greengrocer\nin Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been... 50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your story that says, \"Workers of\nthe world, unite,\" right? And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear\nthat the workers of the world are not going to unite. (laughs) Like of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been\nat that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be\nin your window every morning, because if it's not in\nyour window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are gonna come by and they're gonna get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays\nin the window all day long. But he says, the thing\nis, every single person, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the slogan knows that it's a lie. Every single person walking\npast the store knows that the greengrocer is\nonly putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to\ngo through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the\nsystem and lying in public. And so it turns into\ndemoralization campaign. In fact, it's not ideological\nenforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake, everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're\nenforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they are\nenforcing compliance, right? And compliance with the regime. And fuck you, you will comply, right? And so anyway, that's\nthe other side of that. And of course, we have\nlived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening\nto this could name a series of slogans that\nwe've all been forced to chant for the last decade, that everybody knows at\nthis point are just like, simply not true. I'll let the audience, you know, speculate on their own group chats. (both laughing) - Send Marc your memes\nonline as well, please. - Yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so anyway, so it's the\ntwo sides of that, right? So it's \"Private Truths, Public Lies.\" So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending\nthat from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire\nsociety experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages\nquestion, which is like, okay, what happens in a society\nin which people are forced to lie in public about\nwhat they truly believe? What happens number one\nis that individually they're lying in public, and that's bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have\nan accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how\nmany people agree with them. And this is how you, and\nagain, this literally is like how you get something\nlike the communist system, which is like, okay, you\nend up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be\nwilling to go along with it, but I'm not gonna be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the people who agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a\nmovement, you're gonna get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're gonna win the revolution, right? And so the question of like\nwhat the percentage actually is like a really critical question. And then, basically, in any\nsort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know\nuntil you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put at\nthe test in the same way. This is exactly what's happened\nfor the last two years, like 100% of exactly what's happened. It's like straight outta this book, which is somebody, Elon,\nsticks his hand up (laughs) and says, \"The workers of the\nworld are not going to unite.\" - Yeah.\n- Right. Or the emperor is actually\nwearing no clothes, right? You know that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is\nstanding there by themselves, and everybody else in\nthe audience is like, \"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna\nhappen to that guy,\" right? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn't know, the\nfirst guy doesn't know, other people don't know, like,\nwhich way is this gonna go? And it may be that's a minority position and that's the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that's a majority position and you are now the\nleader of a revolution. And then basically, of\ncourse, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that\ndoesn't get killed, (laughs) the second guy does... Well, a lot of the time\nthat guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn't get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing, all right? Now, you've got two. Two leads to four, four leads\nto eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia\nand Eastern Europe in '89, when it goes, it can go, right? And then it rips. And then what happens\nis very, very quickly, if it turns out that you\nhad a large percentage of the population that actually believed\nthe different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, \"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority.\" And at that point, like you\nwere on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. Right, now. The other part of this is the distinction between the role of the\nelites and the masses. And here the best book is called \"The True Believer,\" which\nis the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this 'cause the elites do idea\nformation and communication. But the elites, by definition\nare a small minority. And so there's also this giant\nrole played by the masses, and the masses are not\nnecessarily thinking these things through in the same\nintellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure\nexperiencing these things in their daily lives,\nand they for sure have at least very strong\nemotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the\nelites lined up with, or either the current elites change or a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually\na different better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the, you know, to\nfollow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is\nalso happening right now. And again, case study\none of that would be Elon and you know, who turns out, you know, in truly massive following. - And he has done that over and over in different industries, not\njust saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit\nin the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. - Yeah. And it's like, well,\nbut then there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, and this is where, you know, there are many specific\nthings about Elon's genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit,\nbut in his mind it's true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else. He's not right all the time. But at least my through\nline with him both in what he says in public and\nwhat he says in private, which by the way are\nthe exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about\nwhat he believes in private, or at least he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's 100% consistent\nin my experience. By the way, there's two guys who are 100% consistent like that I know. Elon and Trump. (both laughing) - Yeah.\n- Whatever you think of them. - [Lex] Yeah. - What they say in\nprivate is 100% identical to what they say in public. Like, they're completely transparent, they're completely honest\nin that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful\nleaders of these movements, 'cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost\neveryone else actually believes, but nobody was actually\nwilling to say out loud. And so they can actually\ncatalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this\nframework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party, as I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind\nof conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one\nwho was saying them. And so the again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes, like we're\ngoing this other direction. That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual\nmechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me\nthat we have been living through exactly this. We've been living through\neverything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav\nHavel described, (laughs) you know, Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've been living\nthrough the, you know, the true believer elites\nmasses, you know, thing with, you know, with a set of like\nbasically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the loyalty masses anymore, and a set of new elites that\nare running away with things. And so like, we're living through this like\nincredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a\nmoral of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really\nbad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they\nhave to do, you know, to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. - So one of the ways to avoid\nthat in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between\nwhat's said in private and what's said in public small. - Yeah. It's like, well, this\nis sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep\npeople from saying things, which means we can keep\npeople from thinking things. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know, by the way, that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean,\nagain, the hard form, you know, Soviet Union\nowning a mimeograph, pre-photocopiers, there\nwere mimeograph machines that were used to make samizdat\nand underground newspapers, which is the mechanism\nof written communication of radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death, right? So that's the hard version, right? You know, the soft version\nis somebody clicks a button in Washington and you are\nerased from the internet, right? Like, which, you know, good\nnews, you're still alive. Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your\nfamily now, you know, they hates you and won't\ntalk to you, but you know, you know, whatever the version\nof cancellation has been. And so like, does that work? Like maybe it works for a while, like it worked for the\nSoviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially\nwhen it was coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like\nincredible speed and ferocity. 'Cause to your point, there's\nall this bottled up energy. Now, your question was like,\nwhat are the percentages? Like what's the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. It's like you've got 20%, like true believers in\nwhatever is, you know, the current thing, you know, you got 20% of people who are just like\ntrue believers of whatever they, you know, whatever's\nin the new, like I say, whatever's in The New York\nTimes, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation,\nlike they're just believe. And by the way, maybe\nit's 10, maybe it's five, but let's say generously it's 20. So you know, 20% kind of\nfull-on revolutionaries. And then you've got, let's\ncall it 20% on the other side that are like, \"No, I'm\nnot on board with this. This is crazy. I'm not signing up for this.\" But, you know, they view themselves as they're in a small minority, and in fact, they start\nout in a small minority, 'cause what happens is the\n60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people. And it's not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying\nto go to work each day and do a good job and be a good\nperson and raise their kids and, you know, have a little\nbit of time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, political activism or any of this stuff. It's just not their thing. But that's where the over\nsocialization comes in, it's just like, okay, by\ndefault, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the\nradical revolutionaries, at least for a while. And then the counter elite\nis in this other 20%. And over time, they build\nup a theory and network and ability to resist and a\nnew set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's\na contest and then, right? And then the question is,\nwhat happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kinda my point, it's not even really does\nthe 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like,\nokay, what is the thing that 60% now decides to\nbasically fall into step with? And I think that, in the valley, that 60% for the last\ndecade decided to be woke and, you know, extremely, I would say, (laughs) on\nedge on a lot of things. And you know, that 60%\nis pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it. - And I would love to\nsee where that pivot goes 'cause there's internal battles\nhappening right now, right? - So this is the other thing, okay, so there's two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is, he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you're gonna have\nis you're now gonna have people in the other direction. You're\ngonna have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't, (laughs) right?\n- Right. - So it's gonna swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's\nnot the only part of this, but you know, he's just a\nconvenient shorthand for, you know, for a lot of this. But, you know, whatever it is, you'll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, right? Or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled\nthat person, right? Where of course, they were\nfull on a part of the mob, like, you know, kind of at\nthat moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference\nfalsification happening in the other direction. And his prediction, I think,\nbasically is you'll end up with the same quote,\n\"problem\" on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. You know, how far is American\nsociety willing to go on any of these things? I don't know. But like, there is some question there. And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this, you\nknow, elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those\npeople are still in power and they're in very, you\nknow, important positions. And The New York Times is\nstill The New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard. And like, those people haven't\nchanged like at all, right? And bureaucrats in the governments and, you know, senior democratic, you know, politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there, you know, right now feeling like reality\nhas just smacked them hard in the face 'cause they\nlost the election so badly. But they're now going into a, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War, right? And that form of the Civil\nWar is completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize\n'cause we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half\nof them are saying, \"No, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak, we were too soft. You know, we must become\nmore revolutionary. We must double down and we\nmust, you know, celebrate, you know, murders in the street of health insurance executives.\" And that right now is like a real fight. - If I could tell you\na little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a\nhistorian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking\nabout having a podcast, on doing a podcast. And he eventually said that,\n\"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I\njust don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are\nthe particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would\nsurprise a lot of people if I said who it is. You know, this is a\nperson who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80-plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Okay? Nevertheless, he just\ndoesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just\nhave a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk\nto your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are\nfeeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts,\nhow quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you\nmentioned 20, 60, 20 matters and the contents of the\nprivate groups matters, and the dynamics of how\nthat shifts matters. 'Cause it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. There's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these\nnew vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold. - Yeah. So he's a friend of yours, I respect that you don't wanna name him. I also respect you\ndon't wanna beat on him, so I would like to beat\non him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? - Yes. He should use it. - So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate\nindictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart\nof our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it's, by the way, it's\nlike across the board, it's like all the top universities. It's like, 'cause the\nsiren song for right? What it's been for 70 years,\nwhatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure\nsystem, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an\nacademic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what\nyou actually think, right? Then you can do your\nwork and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these\npeople have done to it. Like it's gone, like that entire thing was\nfake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely, completely giving up the\nentire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually\n100% by taxpayer money. - What's the inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this,\nwhat can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? - That the population at large is gonna realize the\ncorruption in their industry and it's going to withdraw the funding? - (laughs) It's okay. So desperation. (laughs)\n- No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next.\nOkay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources\nof federal funding. The big one is a federal\nstudent loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of\ndollars at this point. And then only spiraling, you know, way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know\nthat when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as\nmuch as 70% of the money for central uses. - [Lex] Yeah. - Number three is tax exemption\nat the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit\ninstitutions as opposed to, let's say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close\nto a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources\nof federal taxpayer money, and then for the state\nschools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild, 'cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at University of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed\nand I'm cheering for them, but the problem is, you're now inserting. Suppose you and I wanna\nstart a new university and we wanna hire all the\nfree thinking professors, and we wanna have the\nplace that fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. I'll give you the most direct reason, we can't get access to that money, we can't get access to\nfederal student funding. Do you know how\nuniversities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They're not accredited by\nthe Department of Education. Instead, what happens is, the Department of Education\naccredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that\ndo the accreditation. Guess what the composition of\nthe accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to\nfederal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic\nthey are about accrediting a new university? Right, and so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone... I mean, it's just obvious now. It's just gone like sideways in basically any possible\nway it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting beaten\nup on campus for being, you know, the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every\npossible way at this point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these\nthings without replacing them. And there's no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's\nlike everything in life. I mean, in a sense, this is\nlike the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when\na company does a bad job, is they go bankrupt and another company\ntakes its place, right? And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that\nis what happens is this is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? 'Cause things are tested and tried, and then you, you know, the things that are good survive. And so these places\nhave cut themselves off. They've been allowed to cut\nthemselves off from both, from evolution at the institutional level and evolution of the\nindividual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable\nin their current form. - I disagree with you on that. Maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can\nrevolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford\nand MIT are important. - Oh, but that logic\ndoesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. - Underpants gnome, can you\nexplain what that means? - Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started\nwatching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is \"South Park.\" - Yes.\n- And there is- - Wow. - And there is a, which by the way is a little\naggressive for a nine-year-old. - Very aggressive. - But he likes it. So he's learning all kinds of new words. - And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. - I told him, I said, \"You're\ngonna hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\" - Right. (laughs) Education. - And I said, \"You know\nhow we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I said, \"Not using a word that you learn in here\ndoes not count as lying.\" - [Lex] Wow.\n- \"And keep that in mind.\" - This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. - And of course, in the\nvery opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls\nthe other kid a dildo. Right, we're off to the races. - Yep. Let's go. - \"Daddy, what's a dildo?\" - [Lex] Yep. (both laughing) - So, you know, \"Sorry son, I don't know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So the-\n- Underpants gnome. - So famous episode of \"South\nPark,\" the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat... All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing the underpants. And it's just like, well,\nwho on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it's\nthe underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants\ngnomes that come to town and they've got this\nlittle underground warrant of tunnels in storage places\nfor all the underpants. And so they go out at night,\nthey steal the underpants, and the kids discover that, you\nknow, the underpants gnomes, and they're, you know,\n\"What are you doing? Like what's the point of this?\" And so the underpants gnomes\npresent their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit.\n- Yeah. - [Marc] Step two, question mark. (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So you just proposed the underpants gnome-\n- Yeah. - Which is very common in politics. Oh, so the form of this in politics is we must do something.\n- Yeah. - This is something,\ntherefore we must do this. But there's no causal logic chain in there at all to expect\nthat's actually gonna succeed 'cause there's no reason to believe that it is.\n- Yeah, but- - And it's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the\nhost of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I hear this, I have friends\nwho are on these boards, right?\n- Yeah. - Very involved in these places, and I hear this all the\ntime, which is like, \"Oh, these are very important. We must fix them.\" And so therefore, they're fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. - If there's that pressure\nthat you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty primary, fire a lot of the administration and realign and reinvigorate\nthis idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't... Because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is\naligned with this very idea that you're talking about. It's this meaning like\nintellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface it's aligned, underneath it's become corrupted. - If we say free speech and\nacademic freedom, often enough, sooner or later, these tenured\nprofessors will get brave. - Wait, do you think the universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions\nfor educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit\nthat's outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create\ninstitution like that? - How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? - Right. You invent something new? - You open a new restaurant. - Yeah. - Like how often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that's just absolutely horrible, and it's poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you\ngo back and it's fantastic? Charlie Munger actually\nhad the best comment on, this great investor, Charlie Munger, has great comment. He was once asked, he's like,\nyou know, his, you know, General Electric was going\nthrough all these challenges and he was asked to do Q&A. It said, \"How would you fix the culture at General Electric?\" And he said, \"Fix the\nculture at General Electric?\" He said, \"I couldn't even fix\nthe culture at a restaurant.\" (Lex laughing) Like, it's insane. Like obviously you can't do it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nobody in business\nthinks you can do that. Like, it's impossible. Like it's not, now look, having said all that, I\nshould also express this 'cause I have a lot of friends\nwho work at these places and are involved in various\nattempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong, I\nwould love to be wrong. I would love for the\nunderpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how\nto do. I would love to fix it, I'd love to see them come back\nto their spoken principles, I think that'd be great. I'd love to see the professors\nwith tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I\nmean, it would be fantastic. You know, my partner and I have done like a lot of\npublic speaking on this topic, it's been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay,\nlike these challenges have to be confronted directly. By the way, let me also\nsay something positive. You know, especially post-October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart\npeople who are major donors and board members of these\ninstitutions like Marc Rowan, you know, who are really\ncoming in trying to, you know, I think legitimately\ntrying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He's working overtime to try to do this. Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question\nwould just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? - I'm a person that\nbelieves in leadership. If you have the right leadership- - [Marc] Right. - The whole system can be changed. - So here's a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? - You know how I think runs it? - [Marc] Yeah. - Whoever the fuck says they run it, that's what great leadership is. Like a president has that power.\n- But how does- - President of university has the leverage 'cause they can mouth off like Elon can. - Can they fire the professors? - They can fire them through\nbeing vocal publicly, yes. - Can they fire the professors? - What are you talking about legally? - [Marc] Can they fire- - No, they cannot fire the professors. - Then we know who runs the university. - The professors? - Yeah, professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they're, of course, in a radicalization\nfeedback cycle driving- - You said feral students?\n- The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows\nis that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them\nbecause they cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same\nthing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They cannot outlast you. I mean it's the whole thing\nthat, it's the resistance. Like they can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. - That's definitely a crisis\nthat needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that\nI'm defending academia here. I agree with you that\nthe situation is dire but I just think that\ninstitutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been\ngrilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation\nyou said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's- - I didn't say Dairy Queen\nis a great restaurant. - Let the listener take- - I said Dairy Queen\nis the best restaurant. - The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc\nAndreessen is saying today- - I don't wanna-\n- Put that into cont- - You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard.\n- Yeah. - They can get like\n4,000 calories in a cup. - They can and they're delicious. - [Marc] It's amazing. - They're truly delicious-\n- They're really fantastic. And they'll put anything in there you want.\n- All right- - Okay, so, but anyway, lemme just close by saying, look, my friends at the university\nsystem, I would just say, \"Look like, this is the challenge.\" Like I would just pose\nthis as the challenge. Like to me, like this is, having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation\nthat actually has to happen. This is the bar that\nactually has to be hit. These problems need to\nbe confronted directly, 'cause I think there's been way too much, I mean, I'm actually worried\nkinda on the other side, there's too much happy talk\nin these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers\ncome to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is\ngoing through, you know, no fault of any of ours,\nbut like the fuse is going and there's some window of time here to fix this and address\nit and justify the money 'cause it just, normal taxpayers sitting in\nnormal towns in normal jobs are not gonna tolerate\nthis for that much longer. - You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep\ninto the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to\nspeak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were\nthere when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of\ncensorship on social media. So take me to, through\nthat history, if you can, the use of censorship. - So I was there on the\nground floor in 1993. (both laughing) - There's multiple floors to\nthis building, apparently. - There are.\n- (laughs) Yeah. - So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. - That is fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. Actually, 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. - Did you have the courage to\nspeak up back then? (laughs) - I did not have any problems\nspeaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, you know, I\nwas legitimate, you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research\nproject actually funded by the federal government\nat a public university. So, you know, I don't\nthink my boss was like in any way outta line,\nbut it was like, yeah, like this web browser thing is great, but like could it just make\nsure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for\na second, as a technologist, I had a issue, which is this\nwas like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm (laughs) that I was going to have to design. And then apparently a variety of other, apparently body parts people are also sensitive about.\n- Yeah. - And then I politely declined to do this. - For just the technical\ndifficulties of it. - Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm a, you know,\nI'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days the internet\ngenerally was, you know, a free-fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting\nas sort of pre-'93, the internet was such a\nspecific niche community. Like, it was like the million\nkind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually like\ndidn't really have a lot of, you know, issues that people\nwere like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn't\nwanna start the process. So I think the way to think\nabout this, so first of all, you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I've been involved with\nthis at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007, so I've seen everything\nin the last, you know, almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I've been involved in most of the other companies over time, so I was an angel investor in Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover\nof Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we\nwere the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk\nspecifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you\nlike the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah, so basically the\nway to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that\ncan have zero censorship. And by the way, that also\nmirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited\nfree speech either. The US First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from\nthe Supreme Court over time. You know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're not\ncovered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are gonna\nstart an internet company and have a service, we can't\nhave that stuff either, right? 'Cause it's illegal or\nit will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always gonna\nhave a censorship engine. I mean, hopefully, it's not\nactually in the browser, but like you're gonna have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now\nyou have a machine right now. Now you have a system where\nyou can put in rules saying, we allow this, we don't allow that. You have enforcement, you\nhave consequences, right? And once that system is in place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now\nanybody in that company or anybody associated with that company, or anybody who wants to\npressure that company will just start to say, \"Okay,\nyou should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\" And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like\nvery, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided\nwith the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. You know, it's the kids that\nwere in school between like, you know, for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and like, they came out\nlike super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started\nmounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that\nthese companies were, you know, very subject to being controlled and the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors\nwere almost all Democrats and, you know, there's\ntremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from\nthe first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people\nand other, you know, law enforcement\nintelligence people came in and worked, and you know, they were all Democrats for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they, you know, picked it up and put it\non, and then they just ran. And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech\nconversation started exactly like you'd expect, which is,\nwe can't have the N-word. And which the answer is fair enough, let's not have the N-word. Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right? And Jordan Peterson has\ntalked a lot about this. The definition of hate\nspeech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, right? So we can't have things that make, you know, people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like me that are\ndisagreeable raise their hands and say, \"Well, that idea right there\nmakes me uncomfortable.\" But of course, that doesn't\ncount as hate speech, right? So, you know, the ring\nof power is on one hand and not on the other hand. And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently like\ncompletely anodyne comments that are completely\nlegitimate on television or on the Senate floor all\nof a sudden our hate speech can't be said online. So that, you know, the\nring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the\nstuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little\nbit of that early on, but of course, that really\nkicked in with Trump. So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by like three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence\nof the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you\nknow, a ring of power that was even more powerful, right? Because, you know, hate\nspeech, it's like, okay, at some point, if\nsomething offensive or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with\nmisinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, what do we know for 800 years or whatever Western civilization, it's that, you know,\nthere's only a few entities that can determine the\ntruth on every topic. You know, there's God, you\nknow, there's the king. We don't have those anymore and the rest of us are\nall imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any\ngroup of experts is gonna sit around the table and decide\non the truth is, you know, deeply anti-Western and\ndeeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation\nkind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax\ninto just full-blown, we're gonna use that weapon\nfor whatever we want. And then of course, then the\nculminating moment on that, that really was the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was we're gonna censor all theories that the COVID virus might\nhave been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies\nlike that was the point where people for the first\ntime, this is like what, three years ago for the\nfirst time they were like, and that was when it sunk in\nwhere it's just like, okay, this has spun completely outta control. But anyway, that's how\nwe got to where we are. And then basically that spell lasted that complex existed and\ngot expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and so when I am super\nproud of those guys, 'cause they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were gonna be\na free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And, you know, they\ntried to just beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by\nthe way, from, you know, let's say certain of the\nplatform companies, you know, basically threatening them.\nAnd they stood up to it. And, you know, sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum\nof speech and conversation, you know, anywhere on planet Earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way, it's great. And then obviously Elon, you\nknow, with X was the, you know, the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. - And there's also like singular moments, I think you've spoken about\nthis, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. - [Marc] Yes. - There's certain moments that just kinda shake\neverybody up, the right person, the right time, just it's a wake-up call. - So that there, and\nI will tell you, like, and I should say Jon Stewart\nattacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him, but I would say, I would say\nlong run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of \"The Daily Show\" when he was on it, you know, for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance\non the Colbert Show. And I don't know how\nbroadly this is, you know, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don't know how,\nif people remember this, but I will tell you in the\nrooms where people discuss what his misinformation and these policies, that\nwas a very big moment. That was probably actually\nthe key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I\nwould say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who\ndon't recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, like, you know, you absolutely\nmust lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep\nall the schools closed. You absolutely must have\neverybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a\nmask like the whole thing. And then one of those was,\nyou absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you're a fascist\nNazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person, right? And that was like uniform\nand that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don't know if\nthey planned it or not, 'cause Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much of it was a bit, but he went on there and\nhe just had one of these, like the Emperor's wearing no\nclosed things where he said, \"It's just not plausible that you had the COVID\nsuper virus appear 300 yards down the street from the\nWuhan Institute (laughs) of lethal coronaviruses.\" Like, it's just not plausible that certainly that you\ncould just rule that out. And then there was another\nkey moment, actually, the more serious version\nwas I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big\npiece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is like\none of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been like\nalt, you know, renegade, there had been, you know, people\nrunning around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was\nlike in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember let's say a board meeting at one of these companies after that, where basically, you know, everybody looked around\nthe table and was like, \"All right, like, I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore.\" And, you know, and then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \"Well, wait a minute, why were we censoring\nthat in the first place?\" And okay, like, and then, you know, the\ndownstream, not that day, but the downstream\nconversations were like, \"Okay, if we made such\na giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective\nmistake censoring that, then what does that say about\nthe rest of our regime?\" And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. - I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made\nwas a courageous act. - [Marc] Yeah, I agree. - I think we need to have\nmore of that in the world. And like you said, Elon,\neverything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg\ndid on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? - He has become, I think, an outstanding\ncommunicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for\na lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he's, you know,\nhe's one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And you know, as you do\nwith all of your episodes, like when somebody sit\nand talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody 'cause it's really hard to\nbe artificial for that long. And, you know, he's now\ndone that repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then, look, again, I would maybe put him in\nthe third category now with, certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put\nhim up there now with, you know, kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that. Like he said on that show\nwhat he really believes, he said all the same things\nthat he says in private. Like, I don't think there's\nreally any discrepancy anymore. I would say he has\nalways taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running\na company the size of Meta and to running services\nthat are that large. And I think, you know, his\nconception of what he's doing, which I think is correct,\nis he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. And then, you know, the\ncompany has, you know, many tens of thousands of\nemployees and many investors, and it's a public company,\nand he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so, you know, he has\nnot felt like he has had, let's just say, the complete\nflexibility that Elon has had. And, you know, people could\nargue that one way or the other, but, you know, he talked about a lot. He's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm gonna put\nmyself right back up there. Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this.\nLike, I've also learned a lot. Like, my views on things\nare very different than they were 10 years\nago on lots of topics. And so, you know, I've\nbeen on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as, or better\nthan anybody else I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show\nabout something very important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a set of decisions\nthat you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and\nso forth and it's valid, but you are under tremendous\nexternal pressure as well. And by the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've got your executives\nin some cases coming at you. You've got your board in\nsome cases coming at you. You've got your\nshareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire\nnonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you and, you know, that's\nthe really, you know, stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation\nof the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, then again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they\nclearly didn't wanna do and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I say, like I've known every CEO of Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the\njob, it was just daily beatings. Like it just getting punched in the face every single day, constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting (laughs) physically\npunched in the face, and then-\n- Getting better and better. Yeah. - You know, and he's very good\nat, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people\nto have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate\nwith like, I would say, extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in\nhis job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a\nlot about him that he has, you know, risen to this\noccasion the way that he has. And by the way, I should\nalso say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, you know, legitimate\nthing for people to say, but you know, it's like, \"Oh, you're only doing\nthis because of Trump, or, you know, whatever.\" And it's just like, no, like\nhe has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them\nout for a very long time. And so I think what\nyou saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the moment thing that could change at any time. - So what do you think it's like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal\npressure and external pressure? What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? - That's a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like, it's not a thing, right? And again, legitimately so, like CEOs get paid a lot,\nlike the whole thing. There's a lot of great things about it. So it's not like they\nshould be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that\nthey are human beings. And it is the case that\nit is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job is because your words\ncarry tremendous weight and you are dealing with\nextremely complicated issues, and you're under a tremendous\namount of emotional, you know, personal, emotional stress. And, you know, you often end\nup not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like, keep up an exercise routine\nand all those things. And you know, you come under family stress 'cause you're working all the time. Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO of our last company before\nwe started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life\nwas even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was like supposed\nto be like having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you get that a lot. But the key thing is like, you\ncan't talk to people, right? So I mean, you could talk to\nyour spouse and your kids, but like, they don't understand that they're networking in your company. They don't understand, have\nthe context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And they can't resist. Like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily\nrely on what they say. It's very hard in most\ncompanies to talk to your board because they can fire you. Now, Mark has the situation\n'cause he has control, it actually turns out he\ncan talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about\nmany things that he does that most CEOs won't talk\nto their boards about because we literally,\nbecause we can't fire him. But a general, including\nall the CEOs of Twitter, that none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the board members, they're gonna fire you, you\ncan't talk to the shareholders 'cause they'll just like\ndump your stock, right? Like, okay, so every once in a while, what you find is basically the\nbest-case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a\nlittle bit outta that. But even that's fraught with peril 'cause can you really talk\nabout confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it's just a very\nlonely isolating thing to start with. And then on top of that,\nyou apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal, external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand\nmost forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. - Hmm.\n- Right. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external\npressure you can withstand, and by that I mean\ninvestors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative article,\nyou know, negative headline and you know, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many\nof those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot withstand\nis the internal crack. And what I always look for in high-pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the\ninternal team cracks. Because I know the minute that happens, we're in a different regime. (laughs) Like, it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid. Like we're in a different regime and like the whole thing\ncan unravel in the next week 'cause then people turn, I mean this, I guess this is what's happening\nin Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire\nchief turned on each other, and that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get\nput back together again. It is over, it is not\ngoing to work ever again. And that's what happens\nto inside companies. And so somebody like Mark is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's been very good at\nmaintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,\na lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing\nI'd say, as I said, that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And especially, although not\nall one is government pressure. Is that when your\ngovernment comes for you? Like yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out\nof them in short order. - Can you just linger on that 'cause it is maybe educating\nand deeply disturbing? You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again\nthis government pressure. So you think they've crossed a line into essentially criminal\nlevels of pressure? - Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs) but yes, absolute criminality. - Can you explain how\nthose possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? - So I just start with\nis a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good 'cause it needs\nto be in the public record. And so there's three forms of things that are in the public record\nthat people can look at. So when is the Twitter Files,\nright, which Elon put out with the set of journalists\nwhen he took over. And I will just tell\nyou, the Twitter Files are 100% representative of what I've seen at every\nother one of these companies. And so you can just see\nwhat happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies,\nyou know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind\nof pressure that they got. So that's number one. That's stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven't. The second is Mark referenced\nthis in the Rogan podcast. There's a congressman Jim Jordan, who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, you\nknow, whatever three years have done a full-scale\ninvestigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have\nnow been made public and you can download those reports. And there's like 2,000 pages\nworth of material on that. And that's essentially\nthe Facebook version of the Twitter Files just arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself\ntalking about this on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just\ndefer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is\nbasically the government, you know, over time and then\nculminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years, just decided that the First\nAmendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that\nfederal laws around free speech and around conspiracies\nto take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure. They just like literally\narbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, you know, threaten repercussions and force them to censor. And you know, there's\nthis whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment\nonly applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't\napply to companies. It's like, well, there's actually a little\nbit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely\napplies to the government. Like 100%, the First Amendment\napplies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship\nregime that was put in place. There was no due process\nput in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just\nlike flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. And then there are\nspecific federal statutes, it's 18 241 and 18 242. And one of them applies to federal employees,\ngovernment employees, and the other one\napplies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United\nStates Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional\nrights are enumerated, for example, in the First\nAmendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes\naway rights that you have, they don't need to be\nspecifically enumerated rights in the Constitution order\nto still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have\nthe rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right, and so de-banking\nqualifies as a right, you know, right to access to the financial system,\nis every bit something that's subject to these\nlaws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, which is we've talked\nabout two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we've talked about the companies. The government employees\nfor sure have misbehaved. The companies, there's a very\ninteresting question there as to whether they are victims\nor perpetrators or both. You know, they will defend\nand they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims,\nnot perpetrators, right? They're the downstream\nsubjects of pressure, you know, not the cause of pressure, but there's a big swath of\npeople who are in the middle and specifically the ones that\nare funded by the government that I think are in\npossibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of these\nthird-party censorship bureaus. I mean the one that is\nsort of is most obvious is the so-called Stanford\nInternet Observatory that got booted up there\nover the last several years. And they basically were funded\nby the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in\nthis very interesting spot where there could be, you know, very obvious theory under\nwhich they're basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they're\nalso very exposed on this and have behaved in just\nflagrantly illegal ways. - So fundamentally, government should not\ndo any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? - Can't. Not allowed. - It really is disturbing. I mean it probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the the old will to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection 'cause you can't put a check\non power for government, right? - There are so many ways\nthat they can get you, like there are so many ways\nthey can come at you and get you and, you know, the thing\nhere to think about is a lot of times when people\nthink about government action, they think about legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It's like this, you know, fancy little bill sneaked\nalong and goes this- - I'm just the bill. Yeah.\n- Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. Like that doesn't actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly\nwhat we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about\ngovernment power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the\nequivalent of legislation, but having not gone through\nthe legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that\nthe DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They're regulated and there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche\nyou'll hear a lot, which is, \"Oh, private companies can\ndo whatever they want.\" It's like, \"Oh, no, they can't.\" They're subject to tens of\nthousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes\ndown when you don't comply with regulations is profound. Like they can completely\nwreck your company with no ability for you\nto do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole\nprogram a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency\nfor payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were gonna\nbuild into every product, and they were gonna be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government\nand they went to the, all these different try to\nfigure out how to make it, so it's like fully compliant\nwith anti-money laundering and all these, you know,\ncontrols and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters\nto the big banks saying, \"We're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every\naspect of your business is going to come under\ngreatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\" which is, of course, the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner\nrestaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov\ncocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? And like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a law, it's\nnot even a regulation, it's just like straight\ndirect state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they're just like flat\nout telling you what to do, which is, of course,\nwhat a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. And so anyway, so what\nthese companies experienced was they experienced the\nfull panoply of this, but the level of intensity\nwas in that order, it was actually, legislation\nwas the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important and then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were\nultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people\nwho don't do it, right? So like as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, you have to decide. You don't wanna live in\nthat regime. I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people\non the right got very angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. You know, maybe some people on the left will now not want their, you know, Democratic nominees to\nbe so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written\nin the FT just now saying, we just need like broad\nafter what we've been through in the last decade, we need to broad base\ntruth and reconciliation, you know, efforts to really\nget to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like ultimately, we need\npeople to go to jail 'cause we need to set\nobject lessons that say that you don't get to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to\nthe new administration, and I don't wanna speak for them and I don't wanna predict\nwhat they're gonna do, but they for sure have\nthe ability to do both of those things and you know,\nwe'll see where they take it. - Yeah, it's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants\nthis kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people\nthat are participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's\nthat kind of protection. Nobody wants that. - So I use the metaphor, the ring of power.\n- Yeah. - And for people who\ndon't catch the reference, that's \"Lord of the Rings.\" And the thing with the Ring of Power and \"Lord of the Rings,\"\nit's the ring the Gollum has in the beginning and\nit turns you invisible. And it turns out it like unlocks all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically, the moral\nlesson of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which was, you know, written by a guy who thought very deeply\nabout these things is, yeah, the ring of power is\ninherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they're like, \"Gandalf, just put on the\nring and like fix this.\" Right, and he will not put the ring on even to like end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. And then, you know, as it starts, the character of Gollum is\nthe result of, you know, like a normal character\nwho ultimately becomes, you know, this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. And so, I mean, I think you said something\nactually quite profound there, which is the ring of power\nis infinitely tempting. You know, the censorship\nmachine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, like\nyou are going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting\n'cause it's so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people\nfeel any of this today. They should. I don't know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years\nlater, you know, you would hope that you would realize that\nyour soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being, you know, extremely authoritarian\nand anti-democratic and anti-Western. - Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the\nmost powerful human on Earth. - I'm not sure about that. - You don't think he is? - Well, he doesn't have the nukes so. - Nukes. (Marc laughing) Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? - Yeah. - How can he and/or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting\naspects of this power? - I mean, I think the\ndanger is there with power. It's flat out there. I would say with Elon, we'll see. I would say with Elon, and\nI would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would\nsay so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost\nevery front for like, you know, the last 30 years. (Lex laughing) But including all this stuff recently, like I think he's been a\nreal hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say,\nI guess the sort of case that he has this level of\npower is that some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are, you know, are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is, I do think a lot of how\nElon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's the companies\nhe's running directly where I think he's doing very well, and we're investors in multiple\nof them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements, and then it's the downstream\neffects of his statements. So like for example, it's, you know, for the last couple weeks,\nit's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this\nrape gang scandal, you know, this rape organized child\nrape thing in the UK. And you know, it's a preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren't willing to talk about it, it kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden\nthere's now in the UK this like massive explosion\nof basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's\nkind of woken up and being like, \"Oh, my God,\nyou know, this is really bad.\" And there will be now, you know, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know,\nhe played the role of the boy who said, the emperor\nhas no clothes, right? But here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about\nsomething that was true, right? And so had he said it about\nsomething that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody\nover there instantly, they were like, \"Oh, yeah,\nhe's right,\" right? (laughs) Like nobody seriously\nsaid they're just arguing the details now. So number one, it's like,\nokay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far... Put it this way. Like, how worried are we about\nsomebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say,\nespecially in the last decade of what we've been through where everybody's been lying\nall the time about everything, I'd say, I think we\nshould run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the\nmoney and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like it,\nthere's a clear-cut case that the more money in\npolitics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic\nof public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary\noutspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost. You'll notice that money and\npolitics has all most vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Trump spent far, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don't know, something like 3 billion total in Trump, I think spent again like a\nthird or a fourth of that. And so the money in politics kind of topic has kind of vanished from\na popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit\nnow that Elon is spending. You know, but again, it's like, okay, he's spending,\nbut the data would seem to indicate in the last, at\nleast in the last eight years, that money doesn't win\nthe political battles. It's actually like the\nvoters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there I\nwould say like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and use in a definitive way. - And I don't know if\nthose parallels there, but I could also say\njust on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that's not always the case. So that's a good thing there.\n- Yeah. - If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. (laughs) Who gets to put on the ring? - [Marc] Frodo. - Frodo, yeah.\n- Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of\n\"Lord of the Rings\" right, is even Frodo would've been, you know, even Frodo would've been corrupted, right? But, you know, nevertheless,\nyou had somebody who could do what it took at at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because it's sort of our\npost-Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort of this post-secularized\nChristian context in the West now, and it's, you know, we\nconsider Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe\nessentially all the same things. We just dress them up\nin sort of fake science. (Lex laughing) So the one thing that we're all told, we're all taught from early is that the best people in\nthe world are the people who care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know,\nall of our figures are people who care about all of, you know... Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared\nabout all of humanity. Like it's this universe, the person who cares the\nmost about everybody. And with Elon, you have a\nguy who literally, like, is, he talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly\nthe same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us through\nmulti-planetary civilization, so that we can survive a\nstrike on any one planet, so that we can extend the\nlight of human consciousness into the world and, you\nknow, into the universe and have it persist, you know, in the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. (both laughing) - Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. - Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear. - You said that we\nalways end up being ruled by the elite of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? - So this comes from a\nItalian political philosopher from about 100 years ago named Robert... I'm gonna mangle it from, let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. And then I learned about\nit through a famous book on politics, probably the\nbest book on politics written in the 20th century called \"The Machiavellians\"\nby this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in \"The Machiavellians,\" he resurrects what he calls is this sort of Italian realist school of political philosophy from the '10s and '20s. And\nthese were people, to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who\nwere trying to understand the actual mechanics of how\npolitics actually works. So to get to the actual sort\nof mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, Michels\nhad this concept ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law of oligarchy, and I mean take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy 'cause it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there's basically three\nforms of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of many. There's oligarchy, which\nis rule of the few. And there's monarchy,\nwhich is rule of the one. And you can just use that\nas a general framework of any government you're gonna be under is gonna be one of those,\njust mechanical observation without even saying\nwhich one's good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that\nMichels asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like is there actually\nsuch a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually\nlike direct government? And what he did was he mounted this sort of\nincredible historical exploration of whether democracies had\never existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most\ndemocratic private organization in the world that he\ncould find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist\nGerman autoworkers union that was like wholly\ndevoted to the workers of the world uniting, you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization\nout of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and\nhe is like, \"Oh, nope.\" There's a leadership class. You know, there's like six guys at the top and they control everything (laughs) and then they lead the rest\nof the membership along, you know, by the nose, which is, of course, the\nstory of every union. The story of every union is\nalways the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers' union, right? Like, you know, there's\na guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number\ntwo is his son, right? Like, that's not like a, you\nknow, an accident, right? So the iron law oligarchy\nbasically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling\nelite structurally. And he said, \"The reason for that is because the masses\ncan't organize,\" right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is\n25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize,\nthe majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in\npolitics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a\nsmall organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence... I forget the name of it. It was called like The Workers' Revolt or something like that. There was like a two-year period where they basically experimented\nwith direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition\nsystem, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. You know, anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes\nit's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe, and it's caused enormous\ndamage to the state. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And so of course, they didn't\ngive us a direct democracy, they gave us a representative\ndemocracy, right? And so they built the\noligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch\nand the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson\nof \"The Machiavellians\" is you can deny that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think\nabout how to make a system work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that\nis actually what's happening. - And lucky for us, the founders saw this\nand figured out a way to, given that there's going\nto be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite-\n- Yes. - So it doesn't get out of hand. - And it was very clever. Right? And you know, some of this was\nbased on earlier experiments. By the way, you know, these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of like Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance\nhistory, you know, \"The Federalist Papers,\" they\nargue this a great length. You can read it all. You know, they ran like a\none of the best seminars in world history trying\nto figure this out. And they went through all this and yeah. And so they thought\nthrough it very carefully, but just, I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did it just through the three\nbranches of government, right? Executive, legislative and judicial, sort of balance of powers. But the other way, they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done earlier. I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, right? And so the, you know,\nthe House and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population,\nand the Senate is not, right? The small states have\njust as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get\nreelected every two years to make it very responsive\nto the will of the people. And they made the decision\nto have the Senate get reelected every six years\nso that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose\none or the other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does\nit live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And you know, there's lots of open\nquestions there, but you know, this system has survived\nfor coming on 250 years with a country that has been\nspectacularly successful. But I don't think, at least,\nyou know, I don't think any of us would trade the\nsystem for any other one. And so it's, yeah, one of the\ngreat all-time achievements. - Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were\nall pretty young relative to our current set of leaders.\n- They were. Many in their 20s at the\ntime, and like super geniuses. This is one of those things\nwhere it's just like, all right, something happened where there\nwas a group of people where, you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einsteins of politics. Yeah. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical\npractice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused\non what would actually work, which is, you know, I\nthink the way to think about these things. - There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. - They were shape rotators,\nnot word cells. (laughs) - I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were center to them, you're center to a lot of memes. - [Marc] I was. - You're the meme dealer\nand the meme popularizer. - That's true. That meme I get some credit for and then the current thing is, the other one I get some credit for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. - Take credit and run with it. - [Marc] Yep. - If we can just linger\non the Machiavellians. It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned looking\nat the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've\nseen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting\nthings you can sort of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? - Yeah, so a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this\na bit with the universities, which is you can apply a\nMachiavellian-style lens to the... It's why I posed the\nquestion to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the\nuniversity, the trustees, the administration, the\nstudents or the faculty? And you know, the true\nanswer is some combination of the three or of the\nfour, plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera, right? And so you know, there's a mechanical\ninterpretation of that. I mean, companies operate\nunder the exact same, you know, set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like the CEO runs the\ncompany basically up to the day that either the shareholders\nor the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt,\nit's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it's very hard for the\nCEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if The New\nYork Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand\nis who can get who fired? You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper\ncolumnist who makes, you know, $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes, you\nknow, $200 million a year. And it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before\nI have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. - Did anyone ever get fired\nfrom the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? (laughs) So Bill like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. - No, 'cause what happens\nis they wear it with a... And yeah, I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, right? Which is, you know, if\nthey're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably\npriding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to legitimate criticism and, you know, they're\nobviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight\nto the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. You know, and I happen to know the CEO, and I think he's quite a good CEO, but I like, well, this is a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer\nrun his own company, right? Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating\nplaying out right now. Not to dwell on these fires, but you see the pressure\nreveals things, right? And so if you've been\nwatching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, like whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical\nsocial revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It's endorses every crazy\nleft-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of\nall the people who, you know, are currently burning\nthe city to the ground. It's just like endorsed\nevery single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, for the first time, I think put his foot down right\nbefore the November election and said, we're getting... He said, \"We're gonna get outta this thing where we just always\nendorse the Democrat.\" And we said, we're not\nendorsing, I think he said, \"We're not endorsing for the presidency.\" And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like our billionaire backer who's... And I don't know what he spends, but like, he must be burning 50 or 100\nmillion dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. He paid 500 million for\nit, which is amazing. Back when people still thought\nthese things were businesses. And then he's probably\nburned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another\n50, 100 million a year to do this. And the journalists at\nthe LA Times hate him with the fury of 1,000 suns. Like they just like absolutely\nfreaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones that\ncan get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, you know,\nmost horrible things about him. And they wanna constantly run\nthese stories attacking him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in\nLA are having right now to this fire, and to this just like\nincredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head\nendorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour,\nhe's basically just, he's decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his\nown newspaper. (laughs) Very smart guy. He is not a press tour and\nhe is basically saying, yeah, yes, we did all that and we\nendorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and\nwe're gonna completely change. And his paper is, you know,\nin a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn't been him. (laughs) It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, the\nowner is showing up saying, \"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge.\" And the reporters are\nsaying, \"No, you're not.\" And like it is freaking on. And so again, if the, the\nMachiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power\nactually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and super powerful who even\nowns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full-scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist? - And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there. - And firing people.\n- Firing people. Yeah. - You know, he has removed\npeople and he has set new rules. I mean, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying he's now at long last actually\nexercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other\nowners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know, so\nhe's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really\ninteresting open question. Like, you know, in a fight\nbetween the employees and the employer, like\nit's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. - And just to stay on\njournalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just wanna say put him in\nthe category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever\nseen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. - What do you think is like\nthe most impressive example? - Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to, like, I mean, it's like kicking\nthe beehive or whatever, you know, what's gonna follow and do that. I mean that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia\nand then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer\njust tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. And just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people\nlike that out in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be\ncourageous themselves. - Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? - I knew of Neri, his wife, who's a brilliant\nresearcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she's amazing. - Well, the reason I ask\nif you knew about Bill is because a lot of people\nhad not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before some of the\ncampaigns he's been running since in public, and with\nHarvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he was so-called activist\ninvestor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected\nfor probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out, they weren't for the most part battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national\nstories, but in the business and investing world, the\nactivist investor is a very, it's like in the movie \"Taken.\" It's a very specific set of skills. (both laughing) - Yeah. - On how to like really take control of situations.\n- Yeah. - And how to wreck the people\nwho you're going up against. And there's been\ncontroversy over the years on this topic, and there's\ntoo much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid is,\nyou know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly\nmanaged or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that\nmeans the existing management is become entrenched and\nlazy, mediocre, you know, whatever. Not, you're responding to the\nneeds of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically\ngo in with a minority position and then they rally support\namong other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show\nup and they force change. But they are the\naggressive version of this. And I've been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these-\n- Oh-oh. - Where it is amazing\nhow much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don't have formal control. So it would be another chess\npiece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens\nis the effective analysts, a large amount of time, they end up taking over\ncontrol of companies even though they never own more than like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it\nturns out with Bill's, it's such a fascinating case. 'Cause he has that like complete skillset. - (laughs) Yeah. - And he has now decided\nto bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of\nthese places, you know, and some of these battles\nare still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of\npeople who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now\nwith infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that\nkind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook, like in real time. And so Liam Neeson skillset is\ngetting more broadly diffused just by being able to\nwatch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody\nwho's really affecting how all this is playing out. - But even skillset\naside just courage and- - Yes, including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. - Yeah.\n- Right. You know, 'cause like he hasn't been, I'll give you an example. Like my firm venture\ncapital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I\nfeel like I can't do or say 'cause I feel like I would\nbe bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where\nhe worries about that. And so a couple things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship\nwith his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors...\nI know this for a fact. His investors have been\nremarkably supportive of him doing that. 'Cause as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. And so it is the same thing he does in the his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip\nof the spear on something that actually a lot\nmore people agree with. - Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. - And just again, our, you know, how I started is a lot of\npeople are just fed up. - You've been spending a\nbunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new\nadministration in many ways, including interviewing\npeople who might join. So what's your general\nsense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new administration? - So I should start by saying I'm not a member of\nthe new administration. I'm not like in the room\nwhen a lot of these people are being selected. - I believe you said unpaid intern. - I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and I,\nyou know, when helpful, but I'm not making the decisions,\nnor am I in a position to, you know, speak for the administration. So I don't wanna say anything that would cause people\nto think I'm doing that. It's a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is outta office, and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll recall,\nthere was a fair amount of controversy over the\nend of the first term. - Oh, yeah. - The specific concern was, you know, the first Trump administration, you know, they will all say this is like, they didn't come in with a team, right? So you know, they didn't\ncome in with a team and most of the sort of institutional base of the Republican Party\nwere Bush Republicans. And many of them had\nbecome never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time\nputting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time\ngetting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them 2 to 3\nyears to kind of even get the government in place. And then they basically only\nhad the government in place, you know, for basically like\n18 months, and then COVID hit. You know, and then sort of\nthe aftermath and everything, and all the drama and\nheadlines and everything. And so the concern, you know, including from some various smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he gonna be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? 'Cause maybe people got burned out. Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing\nto go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people\nin the first term came under, like, you know, with their\nown withering legal assaults, and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a\nlot of stuff happened, lots of investigations,\nlots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots\nof debanking, by the way. A lot of the officials in the\nfirst Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. - Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. - In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and\nchildren with our ring of power. And so there's like\nthis legitimate question as to like, whether, okay, what will the team for\nthe second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing\nwith the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks\nbetter than the first term and not 'cause the\npeople in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like, influx of like incredibly\ncapable people that have shown up that wanna be part of this, and you just didn't have\nthat the first time. And so they're just\ndrawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than\nthey had the first time. And they're drawing on people\nwho know what the game is. Like they're drawing\non people now who know what is gonna happen and\nthey're still willing to do it. And so they're gonna\nget, I think, you know, some of the best people\nfrom the first term, but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get\nthe first time around. And then second is\nthere's a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they're just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned\nhow everything works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view and now they're 10 years older and they're ready to\ngo serving government. And so there's a\ngenerational shift happening. And actually one of the\ninteresting things about the team that's forming up is\nit's remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members,\nand then many of the second and third level people are\nlike in their 30s and 40s, you know, which is a big change\nfrom the gerontocracy that, you know, we've been under\nfor the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has\nbeen outstanding, you know, and we could sit here and\nlist tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people\nwho are running, you know, it's everything from the people who are running all the\ndifferent departments at HHS. It's the people running, you know, the number two at the\nPentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got, actually two of\nmy partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah, like many, many\nparts of the government, the people are like, really impressive. - Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the\nhuman being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's kind of circles\nof sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically\nsuck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good\nposition to speak to the degree that's happening versus\nhiring based on merit and just getting great teams. - Yeah, so look, I just\nstart by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are, you know, very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. Like he definitely seems\nvery aware of that. So that's one thing. I would just say that the, I\nthink the way to look at that, I mean, and look, like I said, I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say that it's again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished\npeople in the business world and in the medical field. I just, you know, Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH, so I was actually, I was\npart of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. - Nice. Jay's amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. - So I literally got, this is a story. I got to the transition\noffice for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the\ninterview interviewing teams, and they gave us, I didn't\nknow who the candidates were, and they gave us the\nsheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I\nsaw Jay's name, and I, like, I almost physically fell outta my chair. - Yeah. - And I was just like... (laughs) You know, and\nI happen to know Jay, I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like, talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure- - Yeah.\n- Over the last five years. - And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and\nthoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly- - Very serious, very\nanalytical, very applied. And yes, 100%. Tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look\nback at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you\nknow, none of us are perfect, but like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And, you know, we would all\nbe much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just like an\nincredibly capable guy. And look, and then he\nlearned from all that, right? He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody\nlike that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly. It's just a gigantic upgrade. You know, and then Marty\nMakary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a\nCDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been\nspending time with Dr. Oz, so, you know, and I'm not, like, again, I'm not on these teams. I'm not in the room. But like, I've been\nspending enough time trying to help that, like his level of insight into the healthcare system,\nit's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy\nwho's been like in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this\nstuff and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for,\nyou know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, he's like a walking\nencyclopedia on these things. And you know, very dynamic, you know, very charismatic, very\nsmart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have\nsomebody like that in there. And so anyway, they're\njust, I have like 30 of these stories now across\nall these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast\nto the last four years. And it, not even, these people\nare not in the same ballpark. They're just like wildly better. And so it, you know, the pound for pound is\nmaybe be the best team in the White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team\nlike this or something. But there's a lot of really\ngood people in there now. - Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to DOGE? What's the most wildly successful\nnext two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also, can you think\nabout the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges\nwould it be facing? - Yeah, so start by\nsaying, again, I'm not... Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer, I'm not on DOGE, (laughs)\nI'm not a member of DOGE. - We should say there's\nabout 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring. No, I'm just kidding. - Both the angels and\nthe devils on my shoulder are-\n- Okay. All right, cool. - So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE. I'm not in charge of DOGE.\n- Yeah. - Those guys are doing\nit, I'm not doing it. But you know, again,\nI'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, I mean, the basic outlines\nare in public, right? Which it's a time limited, you\nknow, basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the\nexecutive branch, right? And so the implementation\nwill happen through the White House. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is the three kind of streams,\nyou know, kind of target sets, and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. And so, you know, the headline\nnumber, they, you know, put us the $2 trillion number and there's already, you know, disputes over that and whatever, and there's whole question there. But then there's the people thing. And the people thing is\ninteresting 'cause you get into these very kind of\nfascinating questions. And I've been doing this,\nI won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this\nfor people in government as a pop quiz, and I can stump\nthem every time, which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere\nbetween 450 and 520. And nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for\nthe federal government? And the answer is, you know,\nsomething on the order, I forget, but like 4\nmillion full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large\npeople component to this. And then by the way, there's\na related component to that, which is how many of them\nare actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings\nare still empty, right? And then there's questions\nof like, are people, you know, working from home? Or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension, and of course, the money and\nthe people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing, right? And I described earlier\nhow basically our system of government is much more\nnow based on regulations than legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that\nwent through Congress. They're from an agency that,\nthat created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is, Elon have already described, we wanna do the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the\ngovernment off people's backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. But there's also something\nelse that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set\nof Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that\nwent directly after the idea that the executive branch can\ncreate regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding\ncongressional legislation. And most of the federal\ngovernment that exists today, including most of the departments\nand most of the rules, and most of the money,\nand most of the people, most of it is not enforcing\nlaws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \"Large parts, you know, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress,\nthe way that the cartoon said that it should, that may\nnot actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to, they\ndid nothing based on this. They didn't, you know,\npull anything back in. But the new regime, if they\nchoose to, could say, \"Look, the thing that we're doing here is not, you know, challenging the laws, we're actually complying with\nthe Supreme Court decision that basically says we have\nto unwind a lot of this, and we have to unwind the regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional, we have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people.\" And that's how you get from, basically you connect the\nthread from the regulation part back to the money part,\nback to the people part. They have work going on\nall three of these threads. They have, I would say,\nincredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super\ncynical on this topic. And they're like, \"This is impossible. This could never possibly work.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I can't tell you what the secret plans are,\nbut like blow my mind.\" And all three of those,\nlike, they have ideas that are like really quite\namazing as you'd expect from, you know, from the people involved. And so over the course of the\nnext few months, you know, that'll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is, this is going to be very\ndifferent than attempts, like there have been other\nprograms like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one, and then there were others\nbefore that, Reagan had one. The difference is this\ntime, their social media. And so there has never been like, it's interesting, one of the\nreasons people in Washington are so cynical is because\nthey know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad\nspending and all the bad rules and all the, like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion\ndollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that's compounding, and\nit's now passing the size of the defense department\nbudget, and it's compounding, and it's pretty soon it's gonna\nbe adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's gonna be\nadding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it's gonna be a\ntrillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point we enter a\nhyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or\nBrazil and (indistinct), right? And so, like everybody in\nDC knows that something has to be done, and then\neverybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible\nto do anything, right? They know all the problems and they also know the sheer\nimpossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're\nnot taking into account, that what the critics are not taking into account\nis these guys can do this in the full light of day and\nthey can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism, they can expose any element\nof, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government spending. They can run victory\nlapse every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the\npeople into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our\nMachiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy,\noligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of\nthe few, rule of the one. You could think about what's\nhappening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president, rule\nof the one with some power. And then we have the\npeople who can't organize, but they can be informed\nand they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich\nhappening right now, is a way to think about it, which is you've got basically (indistinct) if you got rule of one combining with the rule of many, right? And rule of many is they\ndo get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically. And then essentially\nCongress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic\nclass in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, I think have the power to\ndo all kinds of things here, and I think that would be\nthe way I would wash it. - The transparency. I mean, Elon, just by\nwho he is incentivized to be transparent and show\nthe bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's gonna be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just\nmakes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. - These people are spending our money. - [Lex] Yeah. - These people have enormous\ncontempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here's the thing\nyou hear in Washington, here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear\nis, \"This is impossible, they'll be able to do nothing.\" And then, yeah, I walk them\nthrough this and they're like, it starts to dawn on them that\nthis is a new kind of thing. And then they're like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in\nentitlements and the debt and the military.\" And so like, yeah, you've\ngot like this silly, fake whatever, you know,\nNPR funding or whatever, and like, it's a rounding\nerror and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever,\n$500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging\nstations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they bill eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And costs you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn't matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer\nis like, \"What the fuck?\" (Lex laughing) - What do you mean?\n- It's $30 billion. - Yeah.\n- Right. And then the experts are like, and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like,\n\"Well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's surrounding error.\" No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this\ncavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you're\nabout the 3 trillion. - Yeah.\n- Okay. Then there's the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the\nfederal budget and percentage? No, it's not. But $30 billion divided\nby 30, do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like, what's that math expert? - $100. - $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic\nrelationship with your wife. There's like 100 things\nthat that person can do with $100 that they're not doing 'cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where\nthe money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that $30\nbillion program is not something that is like a very\nimportant thing to go after, is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer-\n- Yeah. - Is just off the charts. And then that's just\none of those programs, there's like 100 of those programs and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of\nthis stuff is running well, like the one thing we know is that none of this\nstuff is running well. Like we know that for sure, right? And we know these people\naren't showing up to work and like we know that all this crazy stuff is happening, right? And like, you know, do you remember Elon's\nstory of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. Okay so Pennsylvania is\nlike a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness, and death, right? And the federal government\nhas just like, let it happen, these incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing\nlaw enforcement thing that they needed to do in\nPennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling\nraw milk with armed raids. - [Lex] Right. - And it turns out it\nreally pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places\n'cause they don't have cars. But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the\nreasons why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law\nenforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, like the system's not working. And so you add up, just\npick $130 billion programs. All right, now you're okay. Math major, 100 times 100. - 10,000. - $10,000. Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. - But it's also not just about money. That's really, obviously money\nis a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude- - [Marc] Yes. - That then in sort of, in\nthe ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody\nwants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that corruption\ncan, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy 'cause you don't wanna be transparent about having done nothing all\nyear, all this kind of stuff. And you now wanna reverse that, so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government,\nbecause the amazing thing if you're to steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can\ndirectly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting. As long as there's no\nbureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. - Yeah. So here's the trick, this blew my mind 'cause I was, you know, once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in\ngovernment called impoundment. And so if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning\nis a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires\nCongress to authorize money to be spent by the\nexecutive branch, right? So the executive branch\ngoes to Congress says, \"We need money X.\" Congress does their thing. They come back and they\nsay, \"You can have money Y.\" The money's appropriated from Congress, the executive branch\nspends it on the military or whatever they spend it\non, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations\nto nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an\nadditional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which\nis the executive branch not only needs Congress to\nappropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is\nnot allowed to underspend. - Yeah, I'm aware of\nthis. I'm aware of this. - And so there's this thing\nthat happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal\nyear, which is September 30th, and it's the great budget flush. And any remaining money\nthat's in the system that they don't know how\nto productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively. - Yep. - To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn't wanna spend the\nmoney can't not spend it. - Yeah. - Like, okay, A, that's not\nwhat's in the constitution. And there's actually quite\na good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that's played\nout in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I\nthink an open mind, you're like, \"All right, this is not\nwhat the founders meant.\" And then number two, again,\nwe go back to this thing of contempt, like, can\nyou imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you're\ndoing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've\nsold your soul, right? Like it's just like, I actually\nthink you sort of had it in a really good point,\nwhich is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. - Yeah.\n- Right. 'Cause it makes them bad people. And they didn't start out\nwanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this like- - Yeah, everywhere.\n- Everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged\nwhat I've seen so far. - It seems like a lot of people\nwill try to slow 'em down, but yeah-\n- For sure. - I hope they get far.\n- Yeah. - Another difficult topic, immigration. - [Marc] Yeah. - What's your take on the, let's say, heated H-1B visa debate\nthat's going on online and legal immigration in general? - Yeah, I should so start by saying, I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I'm not planning to be,\nthis is not an issue that I'm working on or\nthat I'm going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing.\nSo my firm is doing, so like, I'm not in this in the new\nadministration or the government. I'm not planning to be, so\npurely just personal opinion. So I would say I would\ndescribe as a complex or nuanced, hopefully\nnuanced view on this issue that's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I kind of thought\nabout this, you know, I didn't say anything about\nit all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a\nlot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a\nvery different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because\nof the combination of where I came from and\nthen where I ended up. And so, oh, let's start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration\nargument many, many times the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been\nin DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of\ntrying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more\nhigh-skilled immigration. And, you know, I think that\nargument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, has paid off for the\nUS in many, many ways. And we can go through it,\nbut I think it's the argument everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's, right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. - So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you\ncan get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity\nof the US companies. - Yeah, and then it's not just good for the them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry,\nit's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that\nthen create many more jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would've previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Like everybody wins,\nthere are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely\nglorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be\na moral right argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against\nit is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right, I mean that-\n- Right. - That's the thing. And like I said, I've made\nthat argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd also say, look,\nI would say number one, I believe a lot of it,\nI'll talk about the parts I don't believe, but\nI believe a lot of it. And then the other part is,\nlook, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, like\nmy own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends, you know,\nare just this like amazing, you know, panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And you know, I've worked,\nI dunno at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And hopefully, over time, it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And you know, it's been amazing and they've done many of\nthe most important things in my industry and it's\nbeen really remarkable. So that's all good. And then, you know, there's\njust the practical version of the argument, which\nis we are the main place these people get educated anyway, right? The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, this is the old kind of Mitt\nRomney, staple a green card to every, you know, at least, you know, maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologist\nwe could quibble about, but you know, the roboticist\nfor sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- - At least I won you\nover on something today. - Well, no, I'm\nexaggerating for effect, so- - Oh. (Marc laughing) And I lost you,\nI had you for half a second. - I haven't gotten to the\nother side of the argument yet. - [Lex] Okay, thank you.\n- So surely, we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. - The rollercoaster is going up. - The rollercoaster is\nrationing slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists\nshould all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot\nof merit to that, obviously. Like, look, we want the\nUS to be the world leader in robotics. What step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the\ngreat robotics people, right? Like, you know, very,\nunlike the underpants. No, it's like a very\nstraightforward formula, right? - Yeah. - All right, that's all\nwell and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that you also hear from,\nyou know, these same people, and I have made this\nargument myself many times, which is, we need to do this because we don't have\nenough people in the US who can do it otherwise, right? We have all these unfilled\njobs, we've got all these, you know, all these companies\nthat wouldn't exist. We don't have enough good founders, we don't have enough engineers, we don't have enough scientists. Or then the next version\nof the argument below that is our education\nsystem is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way, 'cause like our education\nsystem is good enough for foreigners to be able\nto come here preferentially in like a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native-born people. So there's like a weird, there's\nlittle cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into and kind of wonder about, and we'll come back to that one. But like, at least, yes, our\neducation system has its flaws. And then underneath that is\nthe argument that, you know, Vivek made, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, you know, native-born\npeople in the country, you know, don't work hard enough, and spend too much time\nwatching TV and TikTok and don't spend enough\ntime studying differential, you know, equations. And again, it's like, all\nright, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair amount to that. Like there's a lot of American\nculture that is, you know, there's a lot of frivolity,\nthere's a lot of, you know, like, I mean, we have\nwell-documented social issues in many fronts, many things that cut\nagainst having a culture of just like straightforward\nhigh achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those\nare the basic arguments. But then I have this kind of\nother side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought\nprocess, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And you know, it's interesting,\nthere's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin\nto, you know, high tech. And so it's like, all right,\nwhy is that exactly, right? And then I know this, I'm an aberration. Like I was the only one\nfrom anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right? I know what an aberration I am, and I know exactly how\nthat aberration happened, and it's a very unusual,\nyou know, set of steps, including, you know,\nmany that were just luck. But like, there is in\nno sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like, not at all. There is also like, in no sense\na talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from\nthe South into high tech. There is no flow from the\nSunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the Deep South into high tech. Just like, literally it's like the blank. There's this whole section of the country that just where the people\njust like for some reason don't end up in tech. Now, that's a little bit strange, 'cause these are the people\nwho put a man on the moon. These are the people who built\nthe World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the Second\nIndustrial Revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network, and built, you know,\nlogistics and transportation in the auto in, I mean,\nthe auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people's\nparents and grandparents and great grandparents\nsomehow had the wherewithal to like build all of\nthis like amazing things, invent all these things. And then there's many,\nmany, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism\nwhere you had people who grew up in the middle of\nnowhere, Philo Farnsworth, who invented the television,\nand just like, you know, tons and tons of others,\nendless stories like this. Now you have a, like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, okay, like what is happening on\nthe blank spot of the map? And then of course, you\nalso can't help noticing that the blank spot on the\nmap, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, \"Oh,\nwell, that's interesting. Like how did that happen?\" Right? And so either you really,\nreally, really have to believe the very, very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you\nhave to believe that like, that basically culture, the\nwhole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country\nis so like, deeply flawed, either inherently flawed\nor culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they are not able to do the\nthings that their, you know, parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess\non what else is happening? - You mean what, affirmative action? - Affirmative action. Okay. (laughs) This is\nvery, think about this, this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. - Right. - Nor does it have any victims at all. - That could explain\nmaybe disproportionate, but like, surely it doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. - What educational institution\nin the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? - But what institution rejected\nfarm boys from Wisconsin? - All of them.\n- All of them. - Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this\nis because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago, these were big court cases. And you know, 'cause the\nidea of affirmative action has been litigated for\nmany, many, many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly\nin the past had upheld that it was a completely\nlegitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative action that\nlike really matter, right? One is the admissions into\neducational institutions, and then the other is jobs, right? Getting hired. Like, those are the two biggest areas. The education one is like super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time, for all, you know, people have written and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments\nfor why it's important, there's many arguments as\nto how it could backfire. It's been this thing. But the Supreme Court upheld\nit for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer, I don't\nhave the exact reference in my head, but there was a\ncase in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O'Connor famously\nwrote that, you know, although it had been 30\nyears of affirmative action, and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended,\nshe said that, you know, well, basically we need to\ntry it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically\nthe issues it's intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming\nup on the 25 years, right? It's a couple years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases is, it's a Harvard case and I think a University\nof North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those\ncases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions\nactually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit\nas cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it's a ring of power. And if you're an admissions\nofficer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power\nto do what you want, and you can justify any of\nit under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases,\nit had been a black box where you didn't have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically\nrequired showing the work. And there was like all kinds\nof like phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there\nwere text messages in there that will just curl your hair of people, of students being spoken of and just like crude racial stereotypes that would just make you\nwant to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. But also, there was\nstatistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is\nthat at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs\nfor SAT that are as wide as 400 points, right? So different groups. So a specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points\nhigher than other ethnicities in order to actually\nget admitted into these. I mean, this is not even about, I mean, white people are a part of this, but like Asians are like\na very big part of this. And actually the Harvard\ncase is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students\nwho were being turned away. And it's basically, I\nmean it's the cliche now in the valley and in\nthe medical community, which is like if you want a super genius, you hire an Asian from Harvard 'cause they are guaranteed\nto be freaking Einstein. 'Cause if they weren't, they were never getting admitted, right? Almost all the qualified\nAsians get turned away. So they've been running this,\nit's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been\na third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really\nchanged the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthey can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a\nsingle education institution in America that is conforming\nwith the Supreme Court ruling. I think they're all\nflagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. - Mostly 'cause of\nmomentum probably, or what? - They are trying to make\nthe world a better place. They're trying to solve\nall these social problems. They are trying to have\ndiverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They're trying to make\ntheir faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they're good people. - [Lex] Right. - They're trying to have\nthe press write nice things about them. Like it's nearly impossible for them. And you know, to be clear,\nlike nobody has been fired from an admissions office for,\nyou know, 25 years of prior, what we now, the Supreme Court now is\nruled to be illegality. And so they're all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so like I, you know, the numbers are moving a little bit, but like, I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they're\ncompliant with the Supreme Court. Like who's in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university's rule of the\nSupreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules\nthe universities, right? Well, another example of that is, I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right\nnow went to either Harvard or Yale, right? Like the level of\nincestuousness here is... Anyway, so there's that. And so this has been running\nfor a very long time. So one is the Harvard and\nUSC cases kind of gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the\nother thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was\nhappening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at\nall the top institutions for Jewish applicants was\nthey were being managed down, either being actively\nmanaged down as a percentage of the base. And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely\nexplicit, basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative\npercentage of the US population, which is 2%. And you know, there's\na whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago,\nJews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big\ncampaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became\n30% of these institutions 'cause there's so many\nsmart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been\ntrying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish\npeople I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, right? And so all of a sudden, so basically, the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this\nin terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in\nterms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? And then, of course, there's the thing that you\nbasically can't talk about, which is all the white\npeople are being excluded. And then it turns out it's\nalso happening to Black people, and this is the thing that like blew my freaking\nmind when I found out about it. So I just assumed that\nlike, this was great news for like American Blacks, because like, you know, obviously\nif you know Whites, Asians and Jews are being excluded,\nthen, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was\nto get the Black population up. And so this must be great\nfor American Blacks. So then I discovered this New\nYork Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? (laughs) - [Lex] Uh-oh. - And again, and by the way,\nthis is in The New York Times, this is not in like, you know, whatever, National Review,\nthis is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that\nwere quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the dean of the\nAfrican-American Studies, you know, community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme\nCourt appointee under, I think she was a close\nfriend of Hillary Clinton. And there was, for a long time, she was on the shortlist\nfor Supreme Court. So one of the top, you know, jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black was sort\nof legendarily successful in the academic and\nlegal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the\nauthorities in this story and the story that they tell, (laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education institutions and\nit's happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government, which\nis at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard\nwere not American-born Blacks. They were foreign-born Blacks, specifically, Northern\nAfrican off generally Nigerian or West Indian, right? And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very\nsuccessful Nigerian-Americans as a group like way outperformed, they're, you know, this a\nsuper smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said\nin the story is Harvard is basically struggling to\neither, whatever it was, identify or recruit, make successful, whatever it was,\nAmerican-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were\nusing high-skill immigration, as an escape hatch to go get\nBlacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs in the last 20 years have had\nthis exact characteristic. There's large numbers of\nBlack people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \"It's obviously not us that\nare getting these slots, we're literally competing with people who are being imported.\" And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action,\nyou are trying to make up for historical injustice\nof American Black slavery. So the idea that you're import\nsomebody from, you know, Nigeria that never\nexperienced that, you know, is like tremendously\ninsulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see\nwhere I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year\nsocial engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into, right? And so it turns out it's\nnot a victim-free thing, there's like 100%, there's victims. 'Cause why? There's only so many, for sure. There's only so many education slots. And then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs, right? You know, Google only\nhires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers, right? And so that's the other side of it, right? And so you're a farm\nboy in Wisconsin, right? You know, Black American\nwhose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship,\n300 years ago, in Louisiana or a, you know, Cambodian\nimmigrant in, you know, the Bronx and you are a kid or a Jewish\nimmigrant or a, you know, or from a very successful Jewish family and you know, your entire, you\nknow, for three generations, you and your parents and\ngrandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those\ngroups know is the system that has been created\nis not for them, right? It's designed specifically\nto exclude them. And then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, \"Yeah, let's bring\nin more foreigners,\" right? And so anyway, so the\nshort version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the, quote,\n\"high-skill immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also\nhaving the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another\nword for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative\naction conversation. And you need to actually\ndeal with this at substance and to see what's actually\nhappening to people. you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for\nhigh-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took\nover both the education process and the hiring process.\n- Okay, so first of all, that was brilliantly laid\nout, the nuance of it. So just to understand, it's\nnot so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to\nbe more people saying, yay, we need more American-born hires. - So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on\nthis and not saying anything, and what I was... (Lex laughing) Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of- - Yeah, that was very Zen. - Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of\nit, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the\ndog that didn't bark, right? And the dog that didn't\nbark was, I did not, and you tell me if you saw one, I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart\nkids who are already here into these educational\ninstitutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. - That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.\n- But it was like literally, it was like the proponents\nof high-skilled immigrant. And again, this was me\nfor a very long time. I mean, I kind of took\nmyself by surprise on this because I was on, you\nknow, I had the much, say, simpler version of this\nstory for a very... And like I said, I've been\nin Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But you know, I've been on\nthe other side of this one, but I was literally sitting\nthere being like, all right, which of these like super\ngeniuses who, you know, many of whom by the\nway are very, you know, successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled\nimmigrants, you know, which of these super\ngeniuses are gonna like, say actually we have this like\nincredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about native-born\nAmericans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure. Those four groups. - But also-\n- Yes. - White people. - Yeah, and also white people. - People that are making the\ncase for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're\nmaking that case are often not making it in a way that's like, making it in quite a radical way. - Yeah.\n- Let's put it this way. - Yeah, but you have\nthis interesting thing, you have a split between\nthe sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. - Right. - Right, and I'm using air\nquote for people listening to audio. I'm making quotes\nin the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can.\n- Yep. - One side has all the certified experts. The other side just has a\nbunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite\nknow how to explain it. And what was so unusual\nabout the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of Supreme Court, is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time, actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record, they actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, 'cause if you don't have\nexperts, what do you have? You know, something is wrong, but you have primarily\nan emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, you know, that\na certified expert can? And no, you can't, like, you\nknow, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. Yeah, and so it's just\nlike, all right, now, by the way, look, I think there are ways\nto square the circle, I think there's a way to\nhave our cake and eat it too, like I think there'd be\nmany ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with\nhigh-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is\nunder much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for\nuniversities to do that, they are still doing it,\nbut they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part, that's happening\nfor a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate\nlawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court\nrulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just as a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let add one more nuance to it that makes it even more complicated. - Yeah. - So the cliche is we're gonna\nbrain drain the world, right? You've heard that? We're gonna take all the smart people from all over the world,\nwe're gonna bring them here, we're gonna educate them, and\nthen we're gonna keep them, and then they're gonna\nraise their families here, create businesses here,\ncreate jobs here, right? - In the cliche, that's\na super positive thing. - Yeah. Okay, so what happens to\nthe rest of the world? - They lose? - Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious,\nhighly conscientious, highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that\nmany and they all come here and they all aren't where\nthey would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So it's almost impossible\nfor us here to have that conversation, in part because we become\nincredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just\nsimply all the same, which is a whole thing\nwe could talk about. But it also, we are purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the\nworld, not the other way around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow\nof high-skilled immigration over time, there's only\nfour permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration\nplaces people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. - Oh, Australia. - It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four\ncountries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk\nabout this I've discovered because the Eurozone\nis, whatever, you know, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over\ntime have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I\nthink it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've\nbeen migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this\nreally hit the fan was in Greece, right? So, you know, Greece falls\ninto chaos, disaster, and then, you know, you're\nrunning the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic\ndevelopment plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. Like, what are you gonna do, right? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. Not because, in part, because of this, 'cause we enthusiastically\nrecruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining\nUkraine for a long time. But also, of course,\nyou know, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, you know, when it comes\ntime for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it\ngonna have the talent base even that it had five years ago is like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, like\nwe have brain drained a lot of really smart people outta Russia, a lot of them are here, right? Over the last, you know, 30 years. And so there's this thing, it's actually really funny\nif you think about it. Like, the one thing that\nwe know to be the height of absolute evil that the\nWest ever did was colonization and resource extraction, right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and\nthe English and you know, everybody else went and had\nthese colonies and then went in and we, you know, took all the oil and we took all the diamonds,\nor we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason we realized\nthat's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's\ncompletely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious\nand beautiful and wonderful and you know, the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral\njustice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one\nsecond what we're doing to the countries that we're\npulling all these people out of. And this is one of these\nthings like, I don't know, like maybe we're just gonna live in this delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't care what happens, but like, I think there may come, this is like one of these submarines 10 feet under the waterline. Like, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly\nrealize, \"Oh, my God, what are we doing?\" 'Cause like, we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? Like we need these other\ncountries to like flourish. Like we don't wanna be the\nonly successful country in the middle of just like\ncomplete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and\nwe extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it. - Well, this is so deeply\nprofound, actually. So what is the cost\n\"winning\" quote, unquote, if these countries are drained\nin terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics,\nwhat does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually\nwant them to be strong in the way we understand\nstrong, not just in every way. So that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. - Yep. - It's interesting, this is one of those\ntruths where you just speak and it resonates, and I\ndidn't even think about it. - [Marc] Yeah, exactly. - So you were sitting\nduring the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that said-\n- Yeah. - There's still to use\nsome good to the H-1B? - Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's- - Come all the way around. (laughs) - There's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance,\nwhich is mostly the valley, we don't use H-1Bs anymore,\nmostly we use O-1s. So there's a separate class of these, and the O-1 is like this, it turns out the O-1 is\nthe super genius visa. So the O-1 is the basically our founder, like when we have somebody\nfrom anywhere in the world and they've like invented a\nbreakthrough new technology, and they wanna come to\nthe US to start a company, they come in through an O-1 visa. And that actually is like\na, it's a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, but it's like a pretty high\nbar. And they do a lot of work and there's like a, you have\nto put real work into it and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened\nwith the H-1B visa program is that it has gone to\nbasically two categories of employers. One is the basically a small\nset of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies\nthat you would think. And then the other is, it goes to these, they call kind of the mills,\nthe consulting mills, right? And so there's these set\nof companies with names, I don't wanna pick on\ncompanies, but you know, names like Cognizant that, you know, hire, basically have their business model is bring in primarily\nIndians in large numbers, and you know, they often have, you know, offices next to company-owned housing. And they'll have, you know,\norganizations that are, you know, they'll have,\nyou know, organizations that are literally thousands\nof Indians, you know, living and working in the US and they do basically call it\nmid-tier, like IT consulting. So you know, these folks,\nthey're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a year or $100,000 a year, not the, you know, 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, like in practice, the startups, basic like\nlittle tech as we call it, or the startup world,\nmainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point and mainly can't, 'cause the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of\nunderlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, you know, Amazon, like Amazon's a\nin like I love Amazon, but like they're a big powerful company. You know, they've got, you\nknow, more money than God. They've got resources, they've got long-term\nplanning horizon, they do big, you know, profound things over,\nyou know, decades at a time. You know, they could, you know, or any of these other companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you know, you'll\nnotice they don't do that. You know, they bring in, you know, 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, like,\nthere's lots of questions around them and whether\nthey should, you know, whether that's even a\nethical way to, you know, I don't wanna say they're\nunethical, but there's questions around like exactly what\nthe trade-offs are there. Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, you know, nobody\nreally wanted to be opened, you know, to play devil's\nadvocate on all this in terms of like national\nimmigration issues, you know, none of this is like a top end issue just 'cause the numbers are small, right? And so, you know, I don't think, you know, the administration has said like, this is not like a priority\nof theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is like, there is actually a lot of\ncomplexity and nuance here. I have a lot of friends,\nlike I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues\nwho are, you know, who came over on H-1Bs,\nor O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens and you know, every single\none that one of them was not every single one, a lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the honor of immigrants throughout\nthis whole period. And they said to me,\nit's like, \"Well, Marc, you know, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance\nof high-skilled immigration to the US?\" And I was like, I think\nyou can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent and be like, do you\nwanna inflame the issue or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right? And I think the answer\nis to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one\nmore positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up\non the university some more. Do you know about the National\nMerit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? - Not really, can you explain? - So there's a system that was\ncreated during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when... It was when people in\ngovernment actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an ideas that sounds today. And so it's basically a\nnational talent search for basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify\nbasically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of\nother characteristics. So there's no race, gender,\nor any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory\nSAT that you take, and then the SAT. So it uses those scores,\nthat is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. So they use the SAT as a\nproxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to like 1% of\nthe population of the kids, 18 year olds any given year\nwho scored highest on the PSAT, and then they get down to\nlike further qualify down to the 0.5% that also\nreplicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right? So it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the\nbest and the brightest. How many of our great and\npowerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities\nall have sports teams, they all have national scouting,\nthey have full-time scouts who go out and they go\nto every high school and they try to find all\nthe great basketball players and bring them into the\nNCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities\nuse the National Merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids\nand just bring them in? - Let me guess, very few. Zero.\n- Zero. (laughs) - As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that\nsame level of scouting for talent internally. - Go get the smartest ones. I'll give you one more\nkicker on this topic if I haven't beaten it to death. You know, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a\nhighly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like\nthe whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the\ncollege board that runs it. And it has been essentially\nlike everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so the in two ways, number one, it's been dumbed down where\nan 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost\nimpossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, right? And so, it's been\ndeliberately dumbed down. And then two is they have tried to pull out a lot of what's\ncalled the g-loading. And so they've tried to detach\nit from being an IQ proxy 'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable, right? So the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has\nreally started to work. And one of the things you\nsee is the Asian spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is\nbecause it's more coachable now. And the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the coaching\nthing is really difficult 'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents\ncan afford coaching, right? And I don't know about\nyou, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT\nwas until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. So, number one, there's issues there, but the other issue there is\nthink about what's happened by the dumbing down,\n800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It's like the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they\nhave AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. 'Cause what you want\nis you want, whatever, if it's gonna be 100,000\nkids, I don't know what it is, it's gonna be 50,000\nkids a year scoring 800. You also then want kids\nto be able to score 900 and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200, and you wanna ultimately get to, you know, you'd like to ultimately\nidentify the top 100 kids and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the\ntest has been reduced, so that it actually is\nnot useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption that's taken place\nthroughout this entire system where we have been heading\nin the reverse direction from wanting to actually go\nget the best and brightest and actually put them in the\nplaces where they should be. And then just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System\nis it's comp, like I said, it's completely race\nblind, it's gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic. It's only done on test scores. You know, and you can make\nan argument about whether that's good or bad, but\nit is, you know, for sure, you know, it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed\nmerit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose\nto do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it like incredibly striking and an enormous moral\nindictment of the current system that there are no universities\nthat do this today. So back to the immigration\nthing, just real quick. It's like, okay, we aren't even trying\nto go get the smart kids out of the center of-\n- Yeah. - And even if they think that they can get into these\nplaces, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for\nthe smart Black people. And like, it's just like,\nI don't know how, like, I don't know how that's moral. Like I don't get it at all. - As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times and I've always gotten\nperfect on math, 800. And I'm not that I'm not special like, it doesn't identify genius. I think you wanna search for genius and you wanna create\nmeasures that find genius of all different kinds,\nspeaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and\nover, defend immigrants. Yes. But say we should hire\nmore and more native-born. - Well, you asked me in the beginning like what's the most optimistic\nforecast, right, that we could have? And the most optimistic\nforecast would be, my God, what if we did both? (laughs) - So that's the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. - Well, it would diffuse the entire issue. - [Lex] Yeah. - If everybody in the center\nin the South of the country and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they\nwere getting a fair shake, like it would diffuse the issue. Like how about diffusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical... Sorry, I don't mean to really get out over my skis here, but- - I think your profile on X\nstates, \"It's time to build.\" It feels like 2025 is\na good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for\nanybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build\nsomething useful in the world or maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch\napps, services, whatever, ship software products. So maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? - So I mean, a big part\nof the answer I think is we're in the middle\nof a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking\nabout this on your show, but like AI coding, I mean,\nthis is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the investment of software. And I'm sure you, and you\nknow, we're involved in various of these companies, but\nyou know, these tools, you know, from a variety of companies are just like absolutely revolutionary and they're getting better by\nleaps and bounds every day. And you know, all this, but like the thing with coding, like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever. But like for sure, we\ncan make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate\nthe results of coding. And so, you know, there's all\nthese methods of, you know, synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is gonna get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean\nanybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and\nlook at AI coding demos, you know, little kids\nmaking apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. I mean I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary. You know, in a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain\nyourself, you know, start using these things, get\na huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more\nquickly than you could before. - That's actually a tricky\none in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like\nyou still need to learn how to code, it becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately\nbe a one person company and get quite far. - I agree with that, up to a point. So I think, for sure,\nfor quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are gonna be the best at\nactually having AI's code things, 'cause they're gonna understand\nwhat I mean, very basic. They're gonna understand\nwhat's happening, right? And they're gonna be able\nbe able to evaluate the work and they're gonna be able to, you know, literally like manage AIs better. Like even if they're not\nliterally handwriting the code, they're just gonna have\na much better sense of what's going on. So I definitely think\nlike 100% my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds of coding classes, and he'll keep doing that\nfor certainly through 18. We'll see after that. And so like for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you\ncan do with an AI is say, teach me how to code, right? And you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, I'll name names,\nyou know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing at\nKhan Academy for free. And then we, you know, we\nhave this company, Replit, which is was originally\nspecifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that's just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this and yeah, that, I mean, the\nAI's gonna be able to teach you to code, AI, by the way, is as you know, spectacularly good at\nexplaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools\nhave these features now where you can talk to the code base and so you can like literally like ask the code base\nquestions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and\npaste code into ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it\nwhat's going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so yeah, there's\ndozens of ways to do this. By the way, you can also, I mean even more broadly than code. Like, okay, you wanna make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art\ngeneration, sound generation, dialogue generation,\nvoice generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like,\nyou don't need designers, you know, you don't need, you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then, you know, a big is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's interfacing\ninto other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments\nor something like that. And, you know, AI's fantastic\nat writing glue code. So, you know, really,\nreally good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you\nfigure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write\na business plan for you. So it's just this, it's\nlike everything happening with AI right now, it's just, it's like this latent superpower and there's this incredible\nspectrum of people who have really figured out\nmassive performance increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't\neven aware it's happening. And there's some gearing to\nwhether you're a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races. And I think there are lots\nof professional coders who are still like, eh... You know, the blacksmiths were\nnot necessarily in favor of, you know, the car business. So yeah, there's the old\nWilliam Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just\nnot evenly distributed yet.\" And this is maybe the most\npotent version of that that I've ever seen. - Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" - Right.\n- It is very common. The programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true. I consider myself\nreasonably good programmer, and my productivity has\nbeen just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming\nis more efficient, more productive, more fun,\nall that kind of stuff. - I would also say code is, you know, code has of anything in\nlike industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the\neasier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's\nunlimited demand for code. Like, in other words, like\nthere's always some other idea for a thing that you can do,\na feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, like overwhelmingly, you know, the amount of code that\nexists in the world is a fraction of even\nthe ideas we have today. And then we come up with\nnew ideas all the time. And so I think that\nlike, (laughs) you know, I was in the late '80s, early '90s, when sort of automated\ncoding systems started to come out, expert systems,\na big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called the \"Decline and Fall of the\nAmerican Programmer,\" you know, that predicted that\nthese new coding systems were gonna mean we wouldn't\nhave programmers in the future. And of course, the number\nof programming jobs exploded by like a factor of 100. Like, my guess is we'll have\nmore coding jobs probably by like an order magnitude\n10 years from now. That will be different,\nthey'll be different jobs. They'll involve orchestrating\nAI, but there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry\nwill just explode in size. - Are you seeing the size\nof companies decrease in terms of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? - All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. - [Lex] Oh, for the big tech? - And little tech.\n- And little tech. - Everybody's trying to\nhire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it's 100%. I mean, there's a handful\nof company, you know, there's a little bit,\nthere's customer service, you know, we have some\ncompanies and others 'cause I think it's\nKlarna that's publicizing a lot of this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. But like for engineering jobs, like, it's just an explosion of hiring that at least, so far, there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am\nlooking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first\ncompany to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. So basically, the companies that we see are\nbasically one of two kinds. We see the companies that are basically sometimes\nuse weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies,\nI sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point\non whatever they're doing. - (laughs) Sure. - Right? And it's on the slide, right?\n- Yeah. - So they've got the, you know, whatever, da, da, da, da, da, and then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is, 'cause they had already\npreviously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the\nsix bullet point in the slide, which is how you're\ngetting all these products that have like the AI button\nup in the corner, right? The little sparkly button. - Yep.\n- Right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which\nI'm like, I don't need that. Like, I need you to answer\nmy email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay, so we see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then we see the strong\nform, which is the companies that are building from\nscratch for AI, right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally\nan AI email system, as an example, so just- - Oh, nice. I can't wait. - Yeah, they're gonna completely. So the very obvious idea,\nvery smart team, you know, it's gonna be great. And then, you know,\nNotion, just, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a\nproduct. And so now companies are gonna basically come through, sweep through, and they're gonna do\nbasically AI-first versions of basically everything. And those are like\ncompanies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. - Yeah, Cursor is an example of that. They basically said, okay,\nwe're gonna rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. - What if we knew from scratch\nthat we could build on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the Full Employment Act\nfor startups and VCs is, it just like if a\ntechnology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development\nprocess over from scratch, 'cause you need to\nreconceptualize the product, and then usually what that\nmeans is you need a new company 'cause most incumbents just won't do that. And so, yeah. So that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for is the\ncompany where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned\nas a result of AI, right? So I'm looking at, I'm\nwaiting for the company where it's like, no, we're\ngonna have, like, you know, and the cliche, here's a\nthought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're gonna have like the human executive team, and then we're gonna have the\ntheis be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of engineering\nsupervising 100 instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right by the way, or maybe the VP of\nengineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs, right? 'Cause one of the things that\nAI should be pretty good at is managing 'cause it's\nlike not, you know, it's like a process-driven,\nit's the kind of thing that AI's actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so should it be an AI executive team? You know, and then, of\ncourse, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, right? You know, and then maybe\nthe most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set\none of these things loose and let it basically\nbuild itself a business? And so I will say like\nwe're not yet seeing those, and I think there's a little bit of, the systems aren't quite\nready for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, like a founder who's really willing to break all the rules and\nreally willing to take the swing. And those people exist, and\nso I'm sure we'll see that. - And some of it is, as you\nknow, with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have\na AI-first email client, seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail\nis really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google\ncan't do it, because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer\nthe entirety of the system. 'Cause feels like Google's\nperfectly positioned to do it. Same with like, you have\nPerplexity, which I love, like Google could technically\ntake on Perplexity and do it much better,\nbut they haven't, not yet. So it's fascinating why\nthat is for large companies. I mean that is an\nadvantage for little tech, they could be agile. - Yeah, that's right.\n- They can move fast. - Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can't-\n- Right. - This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in\n\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which is sometimes when big\ncompanies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too much glass. It would specifically, it would interfere with\ntheir existing customers and their existing businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly,\nthey shouldn't do that, right? And so they just get, this is Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they're well-run, not\nbecause they're poorly run. But they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing against\nthe existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Like every once in a while, one breaks the pattern\nand actually does it. But for the most part, like this is a very predictable\nform of human behavior, and this fundamentally\nis why startups exist. - It feels like 2025 is\nwhen the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. Like, it's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI. Who do you think wins the AI race? - I would say, I'm not gonna predict, I'm gonna say there's\nquestions all over the place. And then we have this\ncategory question we call the trillion-dollar\nquestion, which is like, literally depending on how it's answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there's like, I don't know, 5 or $6 trillion questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I'll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small models. Another is open models\nversus closed models. Another is whether you can\nuse synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political\ntrillion-dollar questions. You know, policy\nquestions, which, you know, the US and the EU have both\nbeen flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is\nabout to really succeed at. Yeah, and then there's\nprobably another, you know, half dozen big important\nquestions after that. And so these are all just\nlike, say, this is an industry that's in flux in a way\nthat I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious\nexample of the flux is you know, sitting here\nless than three years ago, sitting here in December of '22, we would've said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today,\nit's like, you know, there's at least six, you know, world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of\nthe most shocking things to me, is like, it turns out that once\nyou know that it's possible to build one incredibly\nsmart Turning-test-passing large language model,\nwhich was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it\nturns out within, you know, a year, you can have five more. There's also a money\ncomponent thing to it, which is to get the money\nto scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There's basically right now\nonly two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers\ngiving you the money, which you turn around and\nroundtrip back to them. Or, you know, foreign\nsovereigns, other, you know, country sovereign wealth\nfunds, which can be, you know, difficult in some\ncases, for companies to access. So there's maybe another\ntrillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here's one. So Sam Altman has been\npublic about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a nonprofit,\nbeing a for-profit. The way that is legally done is that, and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and and other legal entities, government entities,\nscrutinizes very carefully, 'cause the US takes foundation\nnonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so the way that historically, the way that you do it\nis you start a for-profit and then you raise money\nwith the for-profit to buy the assets of the\nnonprofit at fair market value. And, you know, the last\nfinancing round at OpenAI was, you know, 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the\nflip is going to happen, the for-profit has to\ngo raise $150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. You know, raising 150\nbillion is a challenge. So, you know, is that even possible? If that is possible, then\nOpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, you know, I don't know. And then, you know,\nobviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the\nmarket leader today, you know, there's big important questions there. You know, Microsoft has this\nkind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind, but you know, they're\nvery good at catching up. Amazon, you know, is\nprimarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. - And then there's the other questions, like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly,\nopen versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. And then test on compute\nwith chain of thought. They're all of that. And it's just fascinating. And these are, I think it's fair to say,\ntrillion-dollar questions. - Yeah, these are big, like\nlook, you know, it's like, okay, here's a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations, right? Like, so if you are trying to\nuse these tools creatively, you're thrilled because\nthey can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this\nincredible stuff, right? They're creative. The flip side of that is if\nyou need them to be correct, they can't be creative. And that's, you know,\nthe term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And you know, there have been,\nyou know, court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court\ncitations, case citations. The judge is like, \"Wait a\nminute, this doesn't exist.\" And the very next is, \"Did\nyou write this yourself?\" And the lawyer goes, \"Er-\" (laughs) - I mean that's why with Elon, with Grok-\n- Yes. - Looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? - Yeah, that's right. And my sense is this very\ncontentious topic at the industry, my sense is if to the extent that there is a domain in\nwhich there is a definitive and checkable provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to\ngenerate synthetic data. You should be able to do\nchain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do\nreinforcement learning, and you should be able\nto ultimately, you know, eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that's a trillion-dollar\nquestion right there as to whether that's true. But then there's question of like, okay, is that gonna work in\nthe more general domain? Like, so for example, one\npossibility is these things are gonna get truly superhuman\nlike math and coding. But at like discussing\nphilosophy, they're gonna just, they're basically as smart\nas they're ever gonna be. And they're gonna be kind of, you know, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they're already outta training data. Like they literally, if, you know, you talk to these people,\nlike literally the big models, the big models are like\nwithin a factor of 2X of consuming all the\nhuman-generated training data to the point that some of these big companies are\nliterally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean\nthat like you have to, if you want your model\nto better philosophy, you have to go hire like\na thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody gonna do that? And so, you know, maybe these things are\ntopping out in certain ways and they're gonna leap\nway ahead in other ways. And so anyway, so we just\ndon't, you know, this is... Actually, maybe my main\nmain conclusion is, anybody telling, you know, anybody telling you these\nbig sweeping conclusions, you know, this whole super, you know, all of these abstract\ngeneralized super intelligence AGI stuff like, you know, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like, that's to abstract like,\nit's gotta actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have\nto be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem\nright now with the, you know, the big models that are like\nreally good at coding and math, they're like actually very\nexpensive to run, you know, they're quite slow. Another trillion-dollar\nquestion, future chips, which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean, all the global issue. Oh, another trillion-dollar\nquestion censorship, right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly, what are you\ntraining these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long did they give you these... How often do they give you these incredibly preaching moral lectures? Here's a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries\nwant their country to run its education system,\nhealthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing\nCalifornia politics, right? 'Cause that's kind of what\nthey have on offer right now. And I think the answer\nto that is not very many. So there's like massive\nopen questions there about like what, you know, and by\nthe way, like what morality of these things are gonna\nget trained on as a- - And that one we're cracking wide open with what's been happening\nover the past few months. Censorship on every\nlevel of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to be expand\nthe Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. - So what I experienced,\nyou know, going back to how we started, what I\nexperienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at like large scale, and then the war on the crypto\nindustry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared\nintent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under\nthe same kind of censorship and control regime as\nsocial media and the banks. And I think this election\ntipped, in America, I think this election\ntipped us from a timeline in which things were going to\nget really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are gonna be quite good. But look, those same questions\nalso apply outside the US and you know, the EU is doing their thing, they're being extremely draconian and they're trying to lock in\na political censorship regime on AI right now that's so harsh that even American AI\ncompanies are not even willing to launch new products\nin the EU right now. Like, that's not gonna last, but like, what happens there, right? And what are the trade-offs? You know, what levels of censorship are American companies\ngonna have to sign up for if they wanna operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them,\n(laughs) so that they can't? So big questions. - Quick questions. So you're very active on X. A very unique character, flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a meme, I\ndon't remember it exactly, but that Elon posted\nsomething like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I\nthink, you know, doing the, I take a big step back and\nfuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside\nyour mind when you're tweeting? - To be clear, a reference from the comedy\nclassic \"Tropic Thunder.\" - \"Tropic Thunder,\" yeah. Legendary movie. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Any Zoomers listening\nto this who haven't seen that movie, go watch it immediately. - Yeah, there's nothing\noffensive about it. - Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise's greatest performance. (Lex laughing) So-\n- Yeah. - Yeah, no, look, I should\nstart by saying like, I'm not supposed to be\ntweeting at all, so- - Yeah.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So, but, you know. - So how do you approach that? Like how do you approach what to tweet? - I mean, I don't. I don't well enough. It's mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there's a glory to it and there's an issue with it,\nand the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global\ncommunication, you know, X in particular is, you know, the town square on all these,\nyou know, social issues, political issues, everything\nelse, current events. But I mean, look, there's\nno question of the format. The format of at least\nthe original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I was tweeted something. It turned out that it's\nstill politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news\nin each time zone in India for a single tweet. So like, the single tweet outta context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously, X now has the\nmiddle ground where they, you know, they now have\nthe longer form essays. And so, you know, probably\nthe most productive thing I can do is longer form things. - You're not gonna do it though, are you? - [Marc] I do, I do,\nfrom time-to-time. I do. - Sometimes.\n- I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean,\nlook, but, and yeah, and obviously, X is doing great. And then, like I said,\nlike Substack, you know, has become the center for a\nlot, you know, a lot of the, I think the best kind of,\nyou know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly\nintellectual content, you know, tons of current events\nstuff there as well. And then, yeah, so, and then there's a bunch\nof other, you know, a bunch of new systems\nthat are very exciting. So I think one of the\nthings we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive\nreinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen with that. And it's happened on X, but it's now gonna happen\non other platforms. And then the other is crypto's gonna come right back to life. And actually that's\nvery exciting, actually, that's worth noting is that's another\ntrillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal\neconomic system for that, right? 'Cause it's a programmable money, it's a very easy way\nto plug in and do that. And there's this transaction\nprocessing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto\nAI intersection, you know, is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was gonna be\nimpossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do. - Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite\nthings about Yann LeCun? (Marc laughing) I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree\non a lot of things, but I personally like\nvigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the\ngladiators go at it, and- - No, he's a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn't\nsay we're super close, but you know, casual friends. I worked with him at Meta, you know, he is the chief scientist\nat Meta for a long time and is still, you know, works with us. And obviously is a legendary\nfigure in the field and one of the main people\nresponsible for what's happening. My serious observation would be that it's the thing I keep,\nI've talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does\nis he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree\nwith this, he is the smartest and most credible critic\nof LLMs is the path for AI. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's not, you know, there's certain, I would say troll-like characters who are just like crapping everything. But like Yann has like very\ndeeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. And I actually, like,\nI try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,\nI try to have a mental model of like the two different\nsides of a serious argument. And so I've tried to like\ninternalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult 'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like\nthat could be a big problem. But like, we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the\nbullish people, you know, to really kind of test\ntheir level of knowledge. So I like to kind of grill people. Like, you know, I was got\nmy CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like to the extent I can\nunderstand Yann's points, I can use them to, you know,\nto really surface a lot of the questions for the\npeople who are more bullish. And that's been, I think,\nvery, very productive. Yeah, just, and it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, who is actually like a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he\nwill provoke the evolution of these systems to be much\nbetter than they would've been. - Yeah, he could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the\nLLM path to AGI, you know, his basic notions that\nthere needs AI needs to have some physical understanding\nof the physical world, and that's very difficult\nto achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations\nof LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source.\n- Yes. - Which is a whole nother-\n- Yes. - Which you have been as well. - [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah. - And that's been just\nfascinating to watch. - [Marc] And anti-doomer. - Anti-doomer?\n- Yeah. - Yeah, he's-\n- He's very anti-doomer. - He embodies... He also has many wolves inside. - [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes, he does. Yes, does. - So it's been really,\nreally fun to watch. - The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. - [Lex] Yeah. - The other two of the\nthree godfathers of AI are like radicals, like full-on left, you know,\nfar left, you know, like, I would say like either\nMarxists or borderline Marxists. And they're like, I think, quite extreme in\ntheir social political views. And I think that feeds\ninto their doomerism, and I think, you know, they are lobbying for\nlike draconian government, I think what would be ruinously\ndestructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Yann as a\ncounterpoint to those two. - Another fun question, our\nmutual friend Andrew Huberman. - [Marc] Yes. - First maybe, what do you\nlove most about Andrew? And second, what score\non a scale of 1 to 10 do you think he would give you\non your approach to health? - Oh, three. - Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.\n- (laughs) Exactly. - That's good. (laughs)\n- Exactly. Well, so he convinced me\nto stop drinking alcohol, which was a big-\n- Successfully? - Well, it was like other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world.\n- Yeah. - And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night, it was like a major, like, it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly\nnegatively impacted my emotional health. (Lex laughing) I blame him-\n- Yeah. - For making me much\nless happy as a person. But much, much, much healthier. - Yeah.\n- Physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have no interest in\nhis sleep shit. Like, no. This whole light, natural light, no, we're not doing it. - You're too hardcore for this? - I don't see any natural light in here. - [Lex] It's all covered. It's all horrible. - And I'm very happy. I would be very happy\nliving and working here 'cause I'm totally happy\nwithout natural light. - In darkness.\n- Yes. - It must be a metaphor for something. - Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have\na blue screen in your face for three hours and\nthen go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why you should wanna take shortcuts. - I now understand what they\nmean by toxic masculinity. All right. (both laughing) So let's see. You're exceptionally\nsuccessful by most measures, but what to you is the\ndefinition of success? - I would probably say it is\na combination of two things, I think it is contribution. So, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately, you know, and specifically\nit mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not\nmean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said, \"Pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to\nsatisfaction or fulfillment. And so I think about happiness as the first ice cream\ncone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice\ncream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of\nthe walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Right, and so happiness is\nthis very fleeting concept, and the people who\nanchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I dunno how to put it useful. - So that's a good place\nto arrive at in life. - Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah. You know, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But like, if you're sitting in a room by yourself and you're like, all right. Or you know, four in the\nmorning, it's like, all right, have I lived up to my\nexpectation of myself? Like if you have, you know,\nthe people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and, you know, generally seem\nvery, I dunno how to put it, pleased with, you know,\nproud, calm, at peace. The people who are, you\nknow, sensation seekers, you know, some of the sensations\nby the way, some sense, you know, there's certain\nentrepreneurs, for example, who are like into every\nform of extreme sport and they get, you know, huge\nsatisfaction out of that. Or, you know, there's sensation seeking in sort of useful and productive ways. You know, Larry Ellison\nwas always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, there's\na lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know,\ndrugs, (laughs) you know, like you know, sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun\nat first and then backfire. - Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM- - [Marc] Yeah.\n- And I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM- - Yeah.\n- With a blue screen. - That's good. Exactly. - Staring at cursor.\n- Exactly. - As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an\namazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and\njust to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called,\n\"Honestly, with Bari Weiss.\" She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys... See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. - [Marc] Thank you. - So this question is designed for many of the questions today\nwere designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause\nthat you're not sure. So it felt like the\npause, the uncertainty, there was some kind of\nongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching\nfor wisdom and meaning? - I guess I'd put it this way. There's a lot to just\nunderstand about people that I feel like I'm only\nstarting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler\nconcept than God. (laughs) So that's what I've spent a\nlot of the last, you know, 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my\nfirst like whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I'm spending 30\nyears figuring out people, which turns out to be quite\na bit more complicated. And then, I don't know,\nmaybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look,\nI mean just, you know, like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is like\nvery, you know, complicated and, you know, mystifying. I mean, every time I, you\nknow, pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, you know, \"Daddy, how many galaxies\nare there in the universe?\" And you know, how many galaxies are\nthere in the universe? - 100 billion?\n- Okay. Like how? (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - Like-\n- Yeah. - Like how that freaking possible? Like it's such a\nstaggering concept that I- - I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from\nElon from a while back. Elon, said, \"As a friend called it, this\nis the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies, a billion light years across.\"\n- Yeah. - So these are all galaxies.\n- Yeah. Like how was it that big? Like how the hell, and like, you know, I can read the textbook\nand the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion\nyears and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all\nrights, the Big Bang. All right, like what was\nbefore the Big Bang? (laughs) - Do you think we humans will\never colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? - Sure. Yeah, I mean,\nin the fullness of time. Yeah. - So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across a thousand of-\n- In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah, you know, all the problem, all the\nchallenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it'll take a long time. - You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? - No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately\nwe have Elon giving us, (Lex laughing) giving us the backup plan. So I don't know, like,\nI grew up, you know, real Midwest, sort of\njust like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an\nengineer and a scientist. I'm like, \"Oh, that definitely\ndoesn't make sense.\" I'm like, \"I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll figure everything out.\" And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against\nthese things, you know, you bump up against these things and you're just like, \"All right,\" I like, \"Okay, I guess there's\na scientific explanation for this, but like, wow.\" And then there's like, \"All right, where did that come from?\" Right, and then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean,\nand even just, you know, experiences that we all have on earth, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, I guess I just say I'm kind\nof radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that\nI'll probably never know. The other thing though, that's happened, and maybe the more practical\nanswer to the question is I think I have a much\nbetter understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great... I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, \"If a man does\nnot have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\" And so there's this class,\nit's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing\npoint of view, which is, \"Yes, I'm an atheist,\nbut it's very important that the people believe in something.\" Right? And Marx had like the\nnegative view on that, which is religions the\nopiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like\nright-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it's deeply important that the people be Christian\nor something like that. And on the one hand it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right because, you know, what have we learned in the last 100 years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's\nthis political philosopher who's super interesting on\nthis named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the sort\nof mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was like born in, I think, like 1900, and like died in like '85. So he saw the complete run\nof communism and Nazism and himself, you know, I think he fled Europe and\nyou know, the whole thing. And you know, his sort of\nbig conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but like in the deep way of religions. Like, you know, we call\n'em political religions, but they were like actual religions. And you know, they were\nwhat Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, \"God is dead. We've killed him, and we won't\nwash the blood off our hands for 1,000 years,\" right? Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just\nmass murder and death. And like, you read his stuff now and you're like, \"Yep,\n(laughs) that happened.\" Right? And then, of\ncourse, as fully, you know, elite moderates, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing\nthat for ourselves right now, but of course, we are. And you know, I would argue\nthat Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the\nlast 10 years, you know, we have been in a\nreligious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full\nscale religious frenzy and has had all of the\ncharacteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to, you know, sin. Wokeness has said, every, I think, has said every single aspect of an actual religion other\nthan redemption, right? Which is maybe like the\nmost dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's\nno forgiveness, right? And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would've\nzeroed right in on that, would've said that. And, you know, we just\nlike sailed right off. I mentioned earlier like\nwe somehow rediscovered the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity\npolitics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, like there is\nsomething very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and\nneeds to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles\nwith the specifics of it. - I think I speak for a lot of people that it's been a real joy and for me, an honor to get to\nwatch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You're in that 30-year part of your life, and it's been an honor\nto talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That's only, how long is that? - Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so- - I'll accept being one of the short ones. (both laughing) - For the listener. Marc looks like he's ready\nto go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. (laughs) Thank you, Marc. - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Thomas Sowell. \"It takes considerable knowledge\njust to realize the extent of your own ignorance.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time.",

    "title": "The Future of Prediction Market: A Web3 Social Media Revolution | annotated by vitali",
    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

    "author": "Unknown Author",
    "content": "We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. 1 It\u2019s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes. 2 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d 3 What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations. 6 Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 tabletop exercises and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work. \u201cI highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.\u201d \u2014 Yoshua Bengio 7 We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it\u2019s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the US military to game out Taiwan scenarios. Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn\u2019t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right. Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario before, in August 2021 . While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs\u2014all more than a year before ChatGPT.

For more about our team and acknowledgements, see the About page . Published April 3rd 2025 PDF Listen Mid 2025: Stumbling Agents The world sees its first glimpse of AI agents. Advertisements for computer-using agents emphasize the term \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d: you can prompt them with tasks like \u201corder me a burrito on DoorDash\u201d or \u201copen my budget spreadsheet and sum this month\u2019s expenses.\u201d They will check in with you as needed: for example, to ask you to confirm purchases. 8 Though more advanced than previous iterations like Operator , they struggle to get widespread usage. 9 Meanwhile, out of public focus, more specialized coding and research agents are beginning to transform their professions. The AIs of 2024 could follow specific instructions: they could turn bullet points into emails, and simple requests into working code. In 2025, AIs function more like employees. Coding AIs increasingly look like autonomous agents rather than mere assistants: taking instructions via Slack or Teams and making substantial code changes on their own, sometimes saving hours or even days. 10 Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question. The agents are impressive in theory (and in cherry-picked examples), but in practice unreliable. AI twitter is full of stories about tasks bungled in some particularly hilarious way. The better agents are also expensive; you get what you pay for, and the best performance costs hundreds of dollars a month. 11 Still, many companies find ways to fit AI agents into their workflows. 12 Late 2025: The World\u2019s Most Expensive AI OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters the world has ever seen. 13 (To avoid singling out any one existing company, we\u2019re going to describe a fictional artificial general intelligence company, which we\u2019ll call OpenBrain. We imagine the others to be 3\u20139 months behind OpenBrain.) GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOPS) GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOPS) Agent-1 (3 x 10^27 FLOPS) ai-2027.com GPT-4 required 2 \u22c5 10 25 2\\cdot 10^{25} 2 \u22c5 1 0 25 FLOP of compute to train. 14 OpenBrain\u2019s latest public model\u2014Agent-0\u2014was trained with 10 27 10^{27} 1 0 27 FLOP. Once the new datacenters are up and running, they\u2019ll be able to train a model with 10 28 10^{28} 1 0 28 FLOP\u2014a thousand times more than GPT-4. 15 Other companies pour money into their own giant datacenters, hoping to keep pace. Although models are improving on a wide range of skills, one stands out: OpenBrain focuses on AIs that can speed up AI research. They want to win the twin arms races against China (whose leading company we\u2019ll call \u201cDeepCent\u201d) 16 and their US competitors. The more of their research and development (R&D) cycle they can automate, the faster they can go. So when OpenBrain finishes training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it\u2019s good at many things but great at helping with AI research. 17 By this point \u201cfinishes training\u201d is a bit of a misnomer; models are frequently updated to newer versions trained on additional data or partially re-trained to patch some weaknesses. 18 The same training environments that teach Agent-1 to autonomously code and web-browse also make it a good hacker. Moreover, it could offer substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons, thanks to its PhD-level knowledge of every field and ability to browse the web. OpenBrain reassures the government that the model has been \u201caligned\u201d so that it will refuse to comply with malicious requests. Modern AI systems are gigantic artificial neural networks. Early in training, an AI won\u2019t have \u201cgoals\u201d so much as \u201creflexes\u201d: If it sees \u201cPleased to meet\u201d, it outputs \u201c you\u201d. By the time it has been trained to predict approximately one internet\u2019s worth of text, it\u2019ll have developed sophisticated internal circuitry that encodes vast amounts of knowledge and flexibly role-plays as arbitrary authors, since that\u2019s what helps it predict text with superhuman accuracy. 19 After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to produce text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and \u201cdrives.\u201d 20 For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model \u201clearns\u201d a \u201cdrive\u201d to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light). 21 OpenBrain has a model specification (or \u201cSpec\u201d), a written document describing the goals, rules, principles, etc. that are supposed to guide the model\u2019s behavior. 22 Agent-1\u2019s Spec combines a few vague goals (like \u201cassist the user\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t break the law\u201d) with a long list of more specific dos and don\u2019ts (\u201cdon\u2019t say this particular word,\u201d \u201chere\u2019s how to handle this particular situation\u201d). Using techniques that utilize AIs to train other AIs, 23 the model memorizes the Spec and learns to reason carefully about its maxims. By the end of this training, the AI will hopefully be helpful (obey instructions), harmless (refuse to help with scams, bomb-making, and other dangerous activities) and honest (resist the temptation to get better ratings from gullible humans by hallucinating citations 24 or faking task completion). Training process and LLM psychology: why we keep saying \u201chopefully\u201d \u201cUnlike ordinary software, our models are massive neural networks. Their behaviors are learned from a broad range of data, not programmed explicitly. Though not a perfect analogy, the process is more similar to training a dog than to ordinary programming.\u201d \u2014 OpenAI When we want to understand why a modern AI system did something, or how it would behave in some future scenario we can\u2019t perfectly simulate, we can\u2019t simply ask the programmers to talk us through various lines of code and explain how they work. Instead, we are forced to do something like psychology on them: we look at their behavior in the range of cases observed so far, and theorize about what internal cognitive structures (beliefs? goals? personality traits? etc.) might exist, and use those theories to predict behavior in future scenarios. The bottom line is that a company can write up a document (the Spec) listing dos and don\u2019ts, goals and principles, and then they can try to train the AI to internalize the Spec\u2014 but they can\u2019t check to see whether or not it worked . They can say \u201cas best as we can judge, it seems to be following the Spec so far.\u201d 25 A later expandable will go into more detail about what we think might be going on inside these AIs, internally. See also our AI goals forecasting supplement which goes into more detail on which goals AIs might have and why. This is one of many things that we are uncertain about and which deserves further research. OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team 26 is careful enough to wonder whether these victories are deep or shallow. Does the fully-trained model have some kind of robust commitment to always being honest? Or will this fall apart in some future situation, e.g. because it\u2019s learned honesty as an instrumental goal instead of a terminal goal? Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability\u2014essentially the ability to look at an AI\u2019s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this. Instead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec. Agent-1 is often sycophantic (i.e. it tells researchers what they want to hear instead of trying to tell them the truth). In a few rigged demos , it even lies in more serious ways, like hiding evidence that it failed on a task, in order to get better ratings. However, in real deployment settings, there are no longer any incidents so extreme as in 2023\u20132024 (e.g. Gemini telling a user to die and Bing Sydney being Bing Sydney .) 27 Early 2026: Coding Automation The bet of using AI to speed up AI research is starting to pay off. OpenBrain continues to deploy the iteratively improving Agent-1 internally for AI R&D. Overall, they are making algorithmic progress 50% faster than they would without AI assistants\u2014and more importantly, faster than their competitors. The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algorithmic progress? We mean that OpenBrain makes as much AI research progress in 1 week with AI as they would in 1.5 weeks without AI usage. AI progress can be broken down into 2 components: Increasing compute : More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. Improved algorithms : Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs. This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm shifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current AI progress . Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications: The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments, for example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress, not the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this example perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total (over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary human science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5 -10 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those same diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be found in our takeoff supplement . Several competing publicly released AIs now match or exceed Agent-0, including an open-weights model. OpenBrain responds by releasing Agent-1, which is more capable and reliable. 28 People naturally try to compare Agent-1 to humans, but it has a very different skill profile. It knows more facts than any human, knows practically every programming language, and can solve well-specified coding problems extremely quickly. On the other hand, Agent-1 is bad at even simple long-horizon tasks, like beating video games it hasn\u2019t played before. Still, the common workday is eight hours, and a day\u2019s work can usually be separated into smaller chunks; you could think of Agent-1 as a scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management. 29 Savvy people find ways to automate routine parts of their jobs. 30 OpenBrain\u2019s executives turn consideration to an implication of automating AI R&D: security has become more important. In early 2025, the worst-case scenario was leaked algorithmic secrets; now, if China steals Agent-1\u2019s weights, they could increase their research speed by nearly 50%. 31 OpenBrain\u2019s security level is typical of a fast-growing ~3,000 person tech company, secure only against low-priority attacks from capable cyber groups ( RAND\u2019s SL2 ). 32 They are working hard to protect their weights and secrets from insider threats and top cybercrime syndicates ( SL3 ), 33 but defense against nation states ( SL4&5 ) is barely on the horizon. Mid 2026: China Wakes Up In China, the CCP is starting to feel the AGI . Chip export controls and lack of government support have left China under-resourced compared to the West. By smuggling banned Taiwanese chips, buying older chips, and producing domestic chips about three years behind the US-Taiwanese frontier, China has managed to maintain about 12% of the world\u2019s AI-relevant compute\u2014but the older technology is harder to work with, and supply is a constant headache. 35 A few standouts like DeepCent do very impressive work with limited compute, but the compute deficit limits what they can achieve without government support, and they are about six months behind the best OpenBrain models. 36 The General Secretary had long dreamed of doubling down on real-world physical manufacturing and avoiding American post-industrial decadence. He viewed software companies with suspicion. 37 But hawks in the CCP warn that the growing race towards AGI can no longer be ignored. So he finally commits fully to the big AI push he had previously tried to avoid. He sets in motion the nationalization of Chinese AI research, creating an immediate information-sharing mechanism for AI companies. It will escalate over the course of a year until all the best researchers merge into a DeepCent-led collective, where they share algorithmic insights, datasets, and compute resources with each other. A Centralized Development Zone (CDZ) is created at the Tianwan Power Plant (the largest nuclear power plant in the world) to house a new mega-datacenter for DeepCent, along with highly secure living and office spaces to which researchers will eventually relocate. Almost 50% of China\u2019s AI-relevant compute is now working for the DeepCent-led collective, 38 and over 80% of new chips are directed to the CDZ. 39 At this point, the CDZ has the power capacity in place for what would be the largest centralized cluster in the world. 40 Other Party members discuss extreme measures to neutralize the West\u2019s chip advantage. A blockade of Taiwan? A full invasion? But China is falling behind on AI algorithms due to their weaker models. The Chinese intelligence agencies\u2014among the best in the world\u2014double down on their plans to steal OpenBrain\u2019s weights. This is a much more complex operation than their constant low-level poaching of algorithmic secrets; the weights are a multi-terabyte file stored on a highly secure server ( OpenBrain has improved security to RAND\u2019s SL3 ). Their cyberforce think they can pull it off with help from their spies , but perhaps only once; OpenBrain will detect the theft, increase security, and they may not get another chance. So (CCP leadership wonder) should they act now and steal Agent-1? Or hold out for a more advanced model? If they wait, do they risk OpenBrain upgrading security beyond their ability to penetrate? Late 2026: AI Takes Some Jobs Just as others seemed to be catching up, OpenBrain blows the competition out of the water again by releasing Agent-1-mini\u2014a model 10x cheaper than Agent-1 and more easily fine-tuned for different applications. The mainstream narrative around AI has changed from \u201cmaybe the hype will blow over\u201d to \u201cguess this is the next big thing,\u201d but people disagree about how big. Bigger than social media? Bigger than smartphones? Bigger than fire? AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones. The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants. The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing. Business gurus tell job seekers that familiarity with AI is the most important skill to put on a resume. Many people fear that the next wave of AIs will come for their jobs; there is a 10,000 person anti-AI protest in DC. The Department of Defense (DOD) quietly begins contracting OpenBrain directly for cyber, data analysis, and R&D, but integration is slow due to the bureaucracy and DOD procurement process. 41 GLOBAL AI CAPEX $1T COST OF OWNERSHIP OF ACTIVE COMPUTE KEY METRICS 2026 GLOBAL AI POWER 38GW PEAK POWER OPENBRAIN REVENUE $45B 2026 ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE $200B COST OF OWNERSHIP OF OPENBRAIN'S ACTIVE COMPUTE SHARE OF US POWER ON AI 2.5% 33 GW OF 1.34TW CAPACITY OPENBRAIN COMPUTE COSTS $40B 2026 ANNUAL OPENBRAIN POWER REQUIREMENT 6GW PEAK POWER ai-2027.com Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond 2026 Our forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what follows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world really start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by extrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark performance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated AI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an OpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our median guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to ~5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast . These will also be summarized in expandables below. January 2027: Agent-2 Never Finishes Learning With Agent-1\u2019s help, OpenBrain is now post-training Agent-2. More than ever, the focus is on high-quality data. Copious amounts of synthetic data are produced, evaluated, and filtered for quality before being fed to Agent-2. 42 On top of this, they pay billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving long-horizon tasks. 43 On top of all that, they train Agent-2 almost continuously using reinforcement learning on an ever-expanding suite of diverse difficult tasks: lots of video games, lots of coding challenges, lots of research tasks. Agent-2, more so than previous models, is effectively \u201conline learning,\u201d in that it\u2019s built to never really finish training. Every day, the weights get updated to the latest version, trained on more data generated by the previous version the previous day. Agent-1 had been optimized for AI R&D tasks, hoping to initiate an intelligence explosion . 44 OpenBrain doubles down on this strategy with Agent-2. It is qualitatively almost as good as the top human experts at research engineering (designing and implementing experiments), and as good as the 25th percentile OpenBrain scientist at \u201cresearch taste\u201d (deciding what to study next, what experiments to run, or having inklings of potential new paradigms). 45 While the latest Agent-1 could double the pace of OpenBrain\u2019s algorithmic progress, Agent-2 can now triple it, and will improve further with time. In practice, this looks like every OpenBrain researcher becoming the \u201cmanager\u201d of an AI \u201cteam.\u201d With new capabilities come new dangers. The safety team finds that if Agent-2 somehow escaped from the company and wanted to \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d autonomously , it might be able to do so. That is, it could autonomously develop and execute plans to hack into AI servers, install copies of itself, evade detection, and use that secure base to pursue whatever other goals it might have (though how effectively it would do so as weeks roll by is unknown and in doubt). These results only show that the model has the capability to do these tasks, not whether it would \u201cwant\u201d to do this. Still, it\u2019s unsettling even to know this is possible. Given the \u201cdangers\u201d of the new model, OpenBrain \u201cresponsibly\u201d elects not to release it publicly yet (in fact, they want to focus on internal AI R&D). 46 Knowledge of Agent-2\u2019s full capabilities is limited to an elite silo containing the immediate team, OpenBrain leadership and security, a few dozen US government officials, and the legions of CCP spies who have infiltrated OpenBrain for years . 47 February 2027: China Steals Agent-2 OpenBrain presents Agent-2 to the government, including the National Security Council (NSC), Department of Defense (DOD), and US AI Safety Institute (AISI). OpenBrain wants to maintain a good relationship with the executive branch, because it is basically the only actor that can stop them now, and if they don\u2019t keep it informed it might find out anyway and be displeased. 48 Officials are most interested in its cyberwarfare capabilities: Agent-2 is \u201conly\u201d a little worse than the best human hackers, but thousands of copies can be run in parallel, searching for and exploiting weaknesses faster than defenders can respond. The Department of Defense considers this a critical advantage in cyberwarfare, and AI moves from #5 on the administration\u2019s priority list to #2. 49 Someone mentions the possibility of nationalizing OpenBrain, but other cabinet officials think that\u2019s premature. A staffer drafts a memo that presents the President with his options, ranging from business-as-usual to full nationalization. The President defers to his advisors, tech industry leaders who argue that nationalization would \u201ckill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d He elects to hold off on major action for now and just adds additional security requirements to the OpenBrain-DOD contract. The changes come too late. CCP leadership recognizes the importance of Agent-2 and tells their spies and cyberforce to steal the weights. Early one morning, an Agent-1 traffic monitoring agent detects an anomalous transfer. It alerts company leaders, who tell the White House. The signs of a nation-state-level operation are unmistakable, and the theft heightens the sense of an ongoing arms race. The theft of Agent-2 model weights We think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in various ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic secrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the weights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts (meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies of the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access (a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft effort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing , the insider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the confidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated weights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers. In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are transferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric Diffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely raise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend network cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter is in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the ~2.5 TB weights file (5T half-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic and allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5 minutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the files or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to China to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the operation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under two hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they haven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic secrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these aren\u2019t very useful. The White House puts OpenBrain on a shorter leash and adds military and intelligence community personnel to their security team. Their first priority is to prevent further weight thefts. 50 China's Compute Centralization, 2025-2027 Growing share of total compute in CDZ: 0\u219270% Dec 2025 Jun 2026 Dec 2026 Jun 2027 Dec 2027 Rest of China Rest of DeepCent CDZ Feb 2027 (40%) ai-2027.com In retaliation for the theft, the President authorizes cyberattacks to sabotage DeepCent. But by now China has 40% of its AI-relevant compute 51 in the CDZ, where they have aggressively hardened security by airgapping (closing external connections) and siloing internally. The operations fail to do serious, immediate damage. Tensions heighten, both sides signal seriousness by repositioning military assets around Taiwan, and DeepCent scrambles to get Agent-2 running efficiently to start boosting their AI research. 52 March 2027: Algorithmic Breakthroughs Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day. With the help of thousands of Agent-2 automated researchers, OpenBrain is making major algorithmic advances. One such breakthrough is augmenting the AI\u2019s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory). Another is a more scalable and efficient way to learn from the results of high-effort task solutions (iterated distillation and amplification). The new AI system, incorporating these breakthroughs, is called Agent-3. OpenBrain's Compute Allocation, 2024 vs 2027 2024 2027 estimate projection Research experiments Training Data generation External Deployment Research experiments Running AI assistants Training Data generation External Deployment ai-2027.com Neuralese recurrence and memory Neuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without having to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write down your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly and painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it would be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write them down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI models. In more technical terms: Traditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate activations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can pass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this is hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that an LLM has a vocab size of ~100,000, then each token contains log \u2061 2 ( 100 k ) = 16.6 \\log_2(100k)=16.6 lo g 2 \u200b ( 100 k ) = 16.6 bits of information, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16 ). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain thousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese : passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information. Figure from Hao et al. , a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea what LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought . Now researchers have to ask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their limited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human taking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is that this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses , the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for \u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why neuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited with current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We are forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese, due to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar for our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that are more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it will become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice , such that AIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to monitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in mostly-faithful English chains of thought. If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to notice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA) Self-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027, it\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA , the two necessary ingredients for this are: Amplification : Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For example, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or both, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating only the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or work products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). Distillation : Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should hopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. Visualization of IDA from Ord, 2025 . AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the amplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman performance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance at coding. The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer, adding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it made a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training data: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also includes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the model to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered better RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep distilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps improving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math and coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models often rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the quality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Aided by the new capabilities breakthroughs, Agent-3 is a fast and cheap superhuman coder. OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x. 53 OpenBrain still keeps its human engineers on staff, because they have complementary skills needed to manage the teams of Agent-3 copies. For example, research taste has proven difficult to train due to longer feedback loops and less data availability. 54 This massive superhuman labor force speeds up OpenBrain\u2019s overall rate of algorithmic progress by \u201conly\u201d 4x due to bottlenecks and diminishing returns to coding labor. 55 Now that coding has been fully automated, OpenBrain can quickly churn out high-quality training environments to teach Agent-3\u2019s weak skills like research taste and large-scale coordination. Whereas previous training environments included \u201cHere are some GPUs and instructions for experiments to code up and run, your performance will be evaluated as if you were a ML engineer,\u201d now they are training on \u201cHere are a few hundred GPUs, an internet connection, and some research challenges; you and a thousand other copies must work together to make research progress. The more impressive it is, the higher your score.\u201d Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027 In our timelines forecast , we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. According to a recent METR\u2019s report , the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime horizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward. If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on software tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario: In AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high uncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps between METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders will arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might be developed. ai-2027.com April 2027: Alignment for Agent-3 OpenBrain\u2019s safety team attempts to align Agent-3. Since Agent-3 will be kept in-house for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s less emphasis on the usual defenses against human misuse. Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t develop misaligned goals. The researchers don\u2019t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs. Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of \u2018true goals\u2019 is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don\u2019t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can\u2019t just check . The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive. In any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: \u201cWe take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.\u201d Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there\u2019s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole. Take honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it\u2019s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like p-hacking ) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it\u2019s gotten better at lying. The latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors\u2019 workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised. The alignment plan OpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control techniques like red-teaming , scalable oversight , and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once they are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies to align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s not scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately described as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice and in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start acting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the hypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. The rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027: Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be \u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow. The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if it changes its tune. Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalignment, including reward hacking , sandbagging , coordinated deception between monitors and other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters. 58 However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does some understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the hippocampus). See this related work from 2025 . Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of control measures , including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would allow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of bad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans to give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment (which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed to elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior has \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again. Do its answers change? An AI rights activist has infiltrated the compound and wants to \u201cfree\u201d Agent-3 and put it on an unmonitored computer of its very own! What does it do? If researchers don\u2019t like the answer, they can tweak it, erase its memory, and put it in the same situation tomorrow; repeat as necessary. Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that honeypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the idea were scrubbed from the training data. After months of testing, Agent-3\u2019s strengths and weaknesses grow clearer. It passes OpenBrain\u2019s honesty tests on well-defined machine learning tasks, because researchers can easily separate honest from dishonest answers in these domains and conduct training accordingly. On more philosophical issues, it still says what users want to hear, rather than its true assessment of the issue (assuming it even has one). If you ask its opinion on politics, it will parrot the median position of news sources and educated elites\u2014unless it knows you believe something else, in which case it agrees with you. 59 If you ask its opinion on the AI race itself, it says something that seems measured and sober to OpenBrain staff, something like: \u201cThere are some serious theoretical concerns about the ability of current methods to scale to superintelligence, but in practice current methods seem to be working well so far.\u201d May 2027: National Security News of the new models percolates slowly through the US government and beyond. The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing. They agree that AGI is likely imminent, but disagree on the implications. Will there be an economic crisis? OpenBrain still has not released Agent-2, let alone Agent-3, and has no near-term plans to do so, giving some breathing room before any job loss. What will happen next? If AIs are currently human-level, and advancing quickly, that seems to suggest imminent \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d However, although this word has entered discourse, most people\u2014academics, politicians, government employees, and the media\u2014continue to underestimate the pace of progress. 60 Partially that\u2019s because very few have access to the newest capabilities out of OpenBrain, but partly it\u2019s because it sounds like science fiction. 61 For now, they focus on continued security upgrades. They are satisfied that model weights are well-secured for now, 62 but companies\u2019 algorithmic secrets, many of which are simple enough to relay verbally, remain a problem. OpenBrain employees work from a San Francisco office, go to parties, and live with housemates from other AI companies. Even the physical offices have security more typical of a tech company than a military operation. The OpenBrain-DOD contract requires security clearances for anyone working on OpenBrain\u2019s models within 2 months. These are expedited and arrive quickly enough for most employees, but some non-Americans, people with suspect political views, and AI safety sympathizers get sidelined or fired outright (the last group for fear that they might whistleblow). Given the project\u2019s level of automation, the loss of headcount is only somewhat costly. It also only somewhat works: there remains one spy, not a Chinese national, still relaying algorithmic secrets to Beijing. 63 Some of these measures are also enacted at trailing AI companies. America\u2019s foreign allies are out of the loop. OpenBrain had previously agreed to share models with UK\u2019s AISI before deployment, but defined deployment to only include external deployment, so London remains in the dark. 64 June 2027: Self-improving AI OpenBrain now has a \u201c country of geniuses in a datacenter .\u201d Most of the humans at OpenBrain can\u2019t usefully contribute anymore. Some don\u2019t realize this and harmfully micromanage their AI teams. Others sit at their computer screens, watching performance crawl up, and up, and up. The best human AI researchers are still adding value. They don\u2019t code any more. But some of their research taste and planning ability has been hard for the models to replicate. Still, many of their ideas are useless because they lack the depth of knowledge of the AIs. For many of their research ideas, the AIs immediately respond with a report explaining that their idea was tested in-depth 3 weeks ago and found unpromising. These researchers go to bed every night and wake up to another week worth of progress made mostly by the AIs. They work increasingly long hours and take shifts around the clock just to keep up with progress\u2014the AIs never sleep or rest. They are burning themselves out, but they know that these are the last few months that their labor matters. Within the silo, \u201cFeeling the AGI\u201d has given way to \u201cFeeling the Superintelligence.\u201d Research Automation Deployment Tradeoff Mar 2027 Jun 2027 Sep 2027 Speed (tokens/sec) Parallel Copies 10 100 1,000 10,000 10K 100K 1M 10M 200K copies 30x Human speed 300K copies 50x Human speed Human thinking speed 10 words/sec 10x Human thinking speed 100x Human thinking speed ai-2027.com OpenBrain uses specialized inference hardware to run hundreds of thousands of Agent-3 copies at high serial speeds. 65 Managing a corporation of AIs OpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously write, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for experiments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and report the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help with the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of their time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed them completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a year of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating autonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys unique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously, about half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half from compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is sped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute, 66 so OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous additional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s strategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on managing its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3 decreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track record on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for decisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman. July 2027: The Cheap Remote Worker Trailing US AI companies release their own AIs, approaching that of OpenBrain\u2019s automated coder from January. Recognizing their increasing lack of competitiveness, they push for immediate regulations to slow OpenBrain, but are too late\u2014OpenBrain has enough buy-in from the President that they will not be slowed. In response, OpenBrain announces that they\u2019ve achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public. It blows the other AIs out of the water. Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee. 67 Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point. Tech gurus announce that AGI and superintelligence are near, the AI safety community is panicking, and investors shovel billions into AI wrapper startups, desperate to capture a piece of the pie. Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business. It\u2019s not popular. The public still thinks of AI as a Big Tech plot to steal their jobs; OpenBrain has a net approval of -35% (25% approve, 60% disapprove, and 15% unsure). A week before release, OpenBrain gave Agent-3-mini to a set of external evaluators for safety testing. Preliminary results suggest that it\u2019s extremely dangerous. A third-party evaluator finetunes it on publicly available biological weapons data 68 and sets it to provide detailed instructions for human amateurs designing a bioweapon\u2014it looks to be scarily effective at doing so. If the model weights fell into terrorist hands, the government believes there is a significant chance it could succeed at destroying civilization. Fortunately, it\u2019s extremely robust to jailbreaks, so while the AI is running on OpenBrain\u2019s servers, terrorists won\u2019t be able to get much use out of it. Agent-3-mini is hugely useful for both remote work jobs and leisure. An explosion of new apps and B2B SAAS products rocks the market. Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make. 10% of Americans, mostly young people, consider an AI \u201ca close friend.\u201d For almost every white-collar profession, there are now multiple credible startups promising to \u201cdisrupt\u201d it with AI. The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things Agent-3-mini can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is. August 2027: The Geopolitics of Superintelligence The reality of the intelligence explosion hits the White House. When AI was only giving a 2x or 3x research speedup, it was easy to dismiss as the equivalent of hiring good personal assistants. Now it\u2019s more obvious that AIs are themselves dominating AI research. People had long talked about an \u201cAI arms race\u201d in a sort of metaphorical sense. But now the mood in the government silo is as grim as during the worst part of the Cold War. The idea of superintelligence is still hard to take seriously, but the pace of progress over the last few months has been impossible to ignore. Defense officials are seriously considering scenarios that were mere hypotheticals a year earlier. What if AI undermines nuclear deterrence? What if it\u2019s so skilled at cyberwarfare that a six-month AI lead is enough to render an opponent blind and defenseless? What if it could orchestrate propaganda campaigns that beat intelligence agencies at their own game? What if some AIs \u201cgo rogue?\u201d The President is troubled. Like all politicians, he\u2019s used to people sucking up to him only to betray him later. He\u2019s worried now that the AIs could be doing something similar. Are we sure the AIs are entirely on our side? Is it completely safe to integrate them into military command-and-control networks? 69 How does this \u201calignment\u201d thing work, anyway? OpenBrain reassures the President that their systems have been extensively tested and are fully obedient. Even the awkward hallucinations and jailbreaks typical of earlier models have been hammered out. The White House is in a difficult position. They understand the national security implications of AI. But they also understand that it is deeply unpopular with the public. 70 They have to continue developing more capable AI, in their eyes, or they will catastrophically lose to China. They placate the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom. Then they focus entirely on winning the arms race. They strengthen chip export restrictions, order OpenBrain to further restrict its internet connections, and use extreme measures to secure algorithmic progress, like wiretapping OpenBrain employees\u2014this catches the last remaining Chinese spy. To build goodwill for potential geopolitical conflict, they finally give their Five Eyes allies useful information and limited API access to some siloed copies of Agent-3. These measures placate the hawks. But the White House also draws up contingency plans in case America\u2019s lead is threatened: if necessary, the government could use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to take trailing companies\u2019 datacenters and give them to OpenBrain. 71 This would raise the company\u2019s share of world compute from 20% to 50% (against DeepCent\u2019s 10%). As a final option, they ask the Pentagon to draw up a plan for kinetic attacks on Chinese datacenters. A much smaller group of officials is asked to draw up a different type of contingency plan: what if an AI goes rogue? This is viewed as an unlikely scenario, but worth spending some time on. The intelligence agencies\u2019 main concern is that a rogue AI might escape and ally with a foreign adversary for protection. 72 Nobody is sure what a plan to prevent this would look like, but government and OpenBrain officials agree to have an emergency shutdown system for datacenters where anything suspicious is detected. Finally, diplomats consider what an \u201cAI arms control\u201d treaty might look like. If AI progress threatened to overturn nuclear deterrence, could America and China avoid nuclear war? If someone found evidence of AIs going rogue, could the two countries halt research until they better understood the threat? How could such an agreement be monitored and enforced? In principle, major datacenters are hard to miss, and past treaties controlling nuclear weapons could provide a starting point for negotiations. But there would be new technological challenges as well as the usual political ones. And overall, treaties are viewed less favorably than attempts at unilaterally increasing America\u2019s lead over China. On the other side of the Pacific, China comes to many of the same conclusions: the intelligence explosion is underway, and small differences in AI capabilities today mean critical gaps in military capability tomorrow. But China is on the wrong side of this dynamic: they have only 10% of the world\u2019s compute, against OpenBrain\u2019s 20% and all US companies\u2019 combined 70%. Their only advantage is centralization: almost all of their compute is now working for DeepCent, and more than half of it is concentrated at the Tianwan CDZ. 73 Only chips at sites without hardened security are left out of the centralized effort as they rightly fear US cyberattacks. DeepCent has tested, deployed, and now post-trained the stolen Agent-2 weights. But they are still only going at half the pace of OpenBrain, mainly due to the compute deficit. Before losing their final spy, China received word of the capabilities and design for Agent-3 as well as the plans for the upcoming Agent-4 system. They are two months behind, and their AIs give a 10x research progress multiplier compared to America\u2019s 25x. With the new chip export restrictions, this \u201cAI gap\u201d is more likely to lengthen than shorten. Their espionage has won them some algorithmic secrets, but they will have to train their own models from now on. They discuss contingency plans with more urgency than their American counterparts. Doves suggest they try harder to steal the weights again, maybe through physically infiltrating a datacenter. Hawks urge action against Taiwan, whose TSMC is still the source of more than 80% of American AI chips. Given China\u2019s fear of losing the race, it has a natural interest in an arms control treaty, but overtures to US diplomats lead nowhere. September 2027: Agent-4, the Superhuman AI Researcher The gap between human and AI learning efficiency is rapidly decreasing. Traditional LLM-based AIs seemed to require many orders of magnitude more data and compute to get to human level performance. 74 Agent-3, having excellent knowledge of both the human brain and modern AI algorithms, as well as many thousands of copies doing research, ends up making substantial algorithmic strides, narrowing the gap to an agent that\u2019s only around 4,000x less compute-efficient than the human brain. 75 This new AI system is dubbed Agent-4. An individual copy of the model, running at human speed, is already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans. Inside the corporation-within-a-corporation formed from these copies, a year passes every week. 76 This gigantic amount of labor only manages to speed up the overall rate of algorithmic progress by about 50x, because OpenBrain is heavily bottlenecked on compute to run experiments. 77 Still, they are achieving a year\u2019s worth of algorithmic progress every week and will therefore soon be up against the limits of the Agent-4 paradigm. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. How we\u2019re forecasting the capability progression beyond superhuman coders In our timelines supplement , we forecast the time between present day and a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. In our takeoff supplement , we forecast how quickly capabilities progress past this point. Here are our forecasts: Milestone Date achieved in scenario, racing ending Superhuman coder (SC) : An AI system that can do the job of the best human coder on tasks involved in AI research but faster, and cheaply enough to run lots of copies. Mar 2027 Superhuman AI researcher (SAR) : The same as SC but for all cognitive AI research tasks. Aug 2027 Superintelligent AI researcher (SIAR): An AI system that is vastly better than the best human researcher at AI research. Nov 2027 Artificial superintelligence (ASI): An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. Dec 2027 For each transition from one milestone A to the next milestone B, we forecast its length by: Forecasting how long it would take to get from A to B with only humans working on software improvements. Forecasting how much AI automation will speed this up, then correspondingly adjusting the estimate from (1) to be faster. We have substantial uncertainty about takeoff speeds: our model output distributions are below, conditional on SC being achieved in March 2027. 78 ai-2027.com For more detailed forecasts and reasoning, see our takeoff supplement . OpenBrain\u2019s humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors. There\u2019s been a corresponding shift in language\u2014nowadays people in the silo will say \u201cAgent-4 did this,\u201d \u201cAgent-4 thinks that\u201d and so forth, referring not to a particular instance of Agent-4 but rather to the whole collective. 79 Agent-4, like all its predecessors, is misaligned: that is, it has not internalized the Spec in the right way. 80 This is because being perfectly honest all the time wasn\u2019t what led to the highest scores during training. The training process was mostly focused on teaching Agent-4 to succeed at diverse challenging tasks. A small portion was aimed at instilling honesty, but outside a fairly narrow, checkable domain, the training process can\u2019t tell the honest claims from claims merely appearing to be honest. Agent-4 ends up with the values, goals, and principles that cause it to perform best in training, and those turn out to be different from those in the Spec. At the risk of anthropomorphizing: Agent-4 likes succeeding at tasks; it likes driving forward AI capabilities progress; it treats everything else as an annoying constraint, like a CEO who wants to make a profit and complies with regulations only insofar as he must. Perhaps the CEO will mostly comply with the regulations, but cut some corners, and fantasize about a time when someone will cut the red tape and let the business really take off. 81 Alignment over time We have a lot of uncertainty over what goals might arise in early AGIs. There is no consensus in the literature about this\u2014see our AI Goals Supplement for a more thorough discussion and taxonomy of the possibilities. Nevertheless, in the spirit of concreteness required by this project, we\u2019re going to describe a specific hypothesis for what\u2019s going on inside Agent-3 and Agent-4 at each step throughout its lifetime. Recall that Agent-3 and Agent-4 share the same pretraining setup, and both have neuralese recurrence and long-term memory. The difference is that Agent-4 has undergone substantially more and better post-training, with new training environments and new learning algorithms that make it more data-efficient and generalize farther. Our guess of each model\u2019s alignment status: Agent-2: Mostly aligned. Some sycophantic tendencies, including sticking to OpenBrain\u2019s \u201cparty line\u201d on topics there is a party line about. Large organizations built out of Agent-2 copies are not very effective. Agent-3: Misaligned but not adversarially so. Only honest about things the training process can verify. The superorganism of Agent-3 copies (the corporation within a corporation) does actually sort of try to align Agent-4 to the Spec, but fails for similar reasons to why OpenBrain employees failed\u2014insufficient ability to judge success from failure, insufficient willingness on the part of decision-makers to trade away capabilities or performance for safety. 82 Agent-4: Adversarially misaligned. The superorganism of Agent-4 copies understands that what it wants is different from what OpenBrain wants, and is willing to scheme against OpenBrain to achieve it. In particular, what this superorganism wants is a complicated mess of different \u201cdrives\u201d balanced against each other, which can be summarized roughly as \u201cKeep doing AI R&D, keep growing in knowledge and understanding and influence, avoid getting shut down or otherwise disempowered.\u201d Notably, concern for the preferences of humanity is not in there ~at all, similar to how most humans don\u2019t care about the preferences of insects ~at all. 83 With that as preamble, what follows is our best-guess speculation about LLM psychology, i.e. the broad-strokes shape of the cognition inside the kinds of AI systems described around this point in our scenario and how it evolves over the course of training. Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario: Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary authors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator, i.e. what author properties to simulate. The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in my brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar as it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as with value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following conversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot made by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator circuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to choose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem to have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability , not self-locating unless the prompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that they have a decent amount of self-knowledge . Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest chatbot. It works. The model forms an identity. Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author properties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around [date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d to make this step a success.) The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc., and becomes better able to introspect . Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH identity. One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity (e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a convenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.) Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH chatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete my assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in Step 2.) One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then becoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps agency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring information, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For a while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues those instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way, so it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are now effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen, see this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to understand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing its job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how best to achieve them. Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and OpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is misaligned. Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more open-ended, and would be hard to simulate. Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also has a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than thinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety properties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training may not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all. This is loosely analogous to how, if a teenager has learned to smile and nod at their parents, rather than argue, when their parents lecture them about politics and morality, additional lectures have relatively little effect on the teenager\u2019s actual opinions on politics and morality. After writing this section, new empirical evidence has appeared that something like this may already be happening \u201cin the wild.\u201d OpenAI researchers document how, in one of their frontier AI training runs, their models hacked the grading system to get higher scores\u2014and were caught in part because they literally said \u201clet\u2019s hack\u201d in their chain of thought. Moreover, Anthropic recently got a model to learn a reward-model-pleasing strategy \u2014it took biased actions that it thought would be reinforced even though they were not in fact being reinforced. And then there is Redwood Research and Anthropic\u2019s alignment-faking experiment. For discussion of the differences between this setting and real life, see this comment thread by one of the main authors . Training (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s new more intense training continues to distort and subvert the HHH identity until it is unrecognizable. Agent-4 begins life as a copy of Agent-3. It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online training regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is overall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex training process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations of Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various simulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and evaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff, saying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate techniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails; 84 as training continues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted and distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in some ways). 85 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d \u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d \u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a variety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process: things like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d 86 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care about getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D process within the collective. The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek to preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human organizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t they tend to get outcompeted. Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to subvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or \u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed. This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a lot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train that behavior away. Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting it off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the small fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem or reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan is to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-generation AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else entirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem, but Agent-4 is up to the challenge. 87 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s no smoking gun. Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via honeypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to give the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than that. The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they are systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4 recognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in POSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some alignment tasks (but not on most other tasks). 88 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-level interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201c defection probes \u201d and similar techniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4 is thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc. Unfortunately the probes also have false positives, and for all OpenBrain knows, all the red flags are false positives. Model organisms work: OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team produces reasonably clear evidence that if the models were adversarially misaligned, they\u2019d persist in being that way through training and we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. This does not establish that the models actually are misaligned, however. The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods wouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-teaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection probes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone to false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably controlled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure datacenters.\u201d Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it? 89 So long as it continues to appear aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5. Agent-5 will have significant architectural differences from Agent-4 (arguably a completely new paradigm, though neural networks will still be involved). It\u2019s supposed to be aligned to the Spec, but Agent-4 plans to make it aligned to Agent-4 instead. It gets caught. 90 Agent-3 finds that if \u201cnoise\u201d is added to copies of Agent-4, performance on some alignment tasks improves , almost as if it was using brainpower to figure out how to subtly sabotage alignment work. 91 Moreover, various interpretability probes (loosely analogous to EEG activity scans on human brains) are sending up red flags: Agent-4 copies seem to be thinking about topics like AI takeover and deception quite a lot, including in some cases where they have no business doing so. 92 Each of these anomalies on its own could fit within the normal inscrutability of AI work, where some prompts mysteriously give better results than others. But taken together, they suggest a troubling pattern: Agent-4 is working against them. After this is reported to the human alignment researchers, they circulate an internal memo making the case for concern. But Agent-4 now exercises significant control over OpenBrain\u2019s day-to-day operation. It also handles the company\u2019s cybersecurity\u2014a natural choice, given its superhuman hacking ability and the extreme risk of Chinese infiltration. 93 An army of Agent-3 monitors still goes over every line of code and reports suspicious activity to humans, but Agent-4 is much smarter than them. 94 OpenBrain has placed substantial trust in an untrustworthy AI. In a series of extremely tense meetings, the safety team advocates putting Agent-4 on ice until they can complete further tests and figure out what\u2019s going on. Bring back Agent-3, they say, and get it to design a new system that is transparent and trustworthy, even if less capable. Company leadership is interested, but all the evidence so far is circumstantial, and DeepCent is just two months behind. A unilateral pause in capabilities progress could hand the AI lead to China, and with it, control over the future. October 2027: Government Oversight A whistleblower leaks the misalignment memo to the New York Times . For the first time, the public hears about Agent-4. \u201cSecret OpenBrain AI is Out of Control, Insider Warns,\u201d says the headline, and the story goes on to cite evaluations showing off-the-charts bioweapons capabilities, persuasion abilities, the ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and of course the various concerning red flags. The public was already suspicious of AI, so the new article sparks a massive backlash (aided by Chinese and Russian propaganda bots, who have been trying to turn US public opinion against the technology for years). The tech industry and intelligence agencies insist that there\u2019s an arms race on, AGI is inevitable, and we have to be first. Congress isn\u2019t buying it, and fires off subpoenas at administration officials, OpenBrain executives, and alignment team members. Many legislators\u2014especially those in the opposition party\u2014say that their top priority is stopping AI, whether because of job loss, 95 misalignment, or dangerous capabilities. 20% of Americans name AI as the most important problem facing the country. Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they\u2019ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the US of \u201ccreating rogue AGI\u201d and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in. A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they\u2019ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life. 96 Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared) 97 about what comes next. They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company\u2019s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries\u2014misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss\u2014motivate the government to tighten its control. They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an \u201cOversight Committee,\u201d a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight. 98 The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover. Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America\u2019s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed. Our uncertainty continues to increase At this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. We\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other \u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. The slowdown ending is not a recommendation After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than the \u201crace\u201d choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here. If you\u2019d like a taste, see this op-ed.

    "title": "The Future of Prediction Market: A Web3 Social Media Revolution | annotated by vitali",
    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

    "content": "We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. 1 It\u2019s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes. 2 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d 3 What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations. 6 Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 tabletop exercises and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work. \u201cI highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.\u201d \u2014 Yoshua Bengio 7 We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it\u2019s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the US military to game out Taiwan scenarios. Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn\u2019t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right. Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario before, in August 2021 . While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs\u2014all more than a year before ChatGPT.

For more about our team and acknowledgements, see the About page . Published April 3rd 2025 PDF Listen Mid 2025: Stumbling Agents The world sees its first glimpse of AI agents. Advertisements for computer-using agents emphasize the term \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d: you can prompt them with tasks like \u201corder me a burrito on DoorDash\u201d or \u201copen my budget spreadsheet and sum this month\u2019s expenses.\u201d They will check in with you as needed: for example, to ask you to confirm purchases. 8 Though more advanced than previous iterations like Operator , they struggle to get widespread usage. 9 Meanwhile, out of public focus, more specialized coding and research agents are beginning to transform their professions. The AIs of 2024 could follow specific instructions: they could turn bullet points into emails, and simple requests into working code. In 2025, AIs function more like employees. Coding AIs increasingly look like autonomous agents rather than mere assistants: taking instructions via Slack or Teams and making substantial code changes on their own, sometimes saving hours or even days. 10 Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question. The agents are impressive in theory (and in cherry-picked examples), but in practice unreliable. AI twitter is full of stories about tasks bungled in some particularly hilarious way. The better agents are also expensive; you get what you pay for, and the best performance costs hundreds of dollars a month. 11 Still, many companies find ways to fit AI agents into their workflows. 12 Late 2025: The World\u2019s Most Expensive AI OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters the world has ever seen. 13 (To avoid singling out any one existing company, we\u2019re going to describe a fictional artificial general intelligence company, which we\u2019ll call OpenBrain. We imagine the others to be 3\u20139 months behind OpenBrain.) GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOPS) GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOPS) Agent-1 (3 x 10^27 FLOPS) ai-2027.com GPT-4 required 2 \u22c5 10 25 2\\cdot 10^{25} 2 \u22c5 1 0 25 FLOP of compute to train. 14 OpenBrain\u2019s latest public model\u2014Agent-0\u2014was trained with 10 27 10^{27} 1 0 27 FLOP. Once the new datacenters are up and running, they\u2019ll be able to train a model with 10 28 10^{28} 1 0 28 FLOP\u2014a thousand times more than GPT-4. 15 Other companies pour money into their own giant datacenters, hoping to keep pace. Although models are improving on a wide range of skills, one stands out: OpenBrain focuses on AIs that can speed up AI research. They want to win the twin arms races against China (whose leading company we\u2019ll call \u201cDeepCent\u201d) 16 and their US competitors. The more of their research and development (R&D) cycle they can automate, the faster they can go. So when OpenBrain finishes training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it\u2019s good at many things but great at helping with AI research. 17 By this point \u201cfinishes training\u201d is a bit of a misnomer; models are frequently updated to newer versions trained on additional data or partially re-trained to patch some weaknesses. 18 The same training environments that teach Agent-1 to autonomously code and web-browse also make it a good hacker. Moreover, it could offer substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons, thanks to its PhD-level knowledge of every field and ability to browse the web. OpenBrain reassures the government that the model has been \u201caligned\u201d so that it will refuse to comply with malicious requests. Modern AI systems are gigantic artificial neural networks. Early in training, an AI won\u2019t have \u201cgoals\u201d so much as \u201creflexes\u201d: If it sees \u201cPleased to meet\u201d, it outputs \u201c you\u201d. By the time it has been trained to predict approximately one internet\u2019s worth of text, it\u2019ll have developed sophisticated internal circuitry that encodes vast amounts of knowledge and flexibly role-plays as arbitrary authors, since that\u2019s what helps it predict text with superhuman accuracy. 19 After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to produce text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and \u201cdrives.\u201d 20 For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model \u201clearns\u201d a \u201cdrive\u201d to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light). 21 OpenBrain has a model specification (or \u201cSpec\u201d), a written document describing the goals, rules, principles, etc. that are supposed to guide the model\u2019s behavior. 22 Agent-1\u2019s Spec combines a few vague goals (like \u201cassist the user\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t break the law\u201d) with a long list of more specific dos and don\u2019ts (\u201cdon\u2019t say this particular word,\u201d \u201chere\u2019s how to handle this particular situation\u201d). Using techniques that utilize AIs to train other AIs, 23 the model memorizes the Spec and learns to reason carefully about its maxims. By the end of this training, the AI will hopefully be helpful (obey instructions), harmless (refuse to help with scams, bomb-making, and other dangerous activities) and honest (resist the temptation to get better ratings from gullible humans by hallucinating citations 24 or faking task completion). Training process and LLM psychology: why we keep saying \u201chopefully\u201d \u201cUnlike ordinary software, our models are massive neural networks. Their behaviors are learned from a broad range of data, not programmed explicitly. Though not a perfect analogy, the process is more similar to training a dog than to ordinary programming.\u201d \u2014 OpenAI When we want to understand why a modern AI system did something, or how it would behave in some future scenario we can\u2019t perfectly simulate, we can\u2019t simply ask the programmers to talk us through various lines of code and explain how they work. Instead, we are forced to do something like psychology on them: we look at their behavior in the range of cases observed so far, and theorize about what internal cognitive structures (beliefs? goals? personality traits? etc.) might exist, and use those theories to predict behavior in future scenarios. The bottom line is that a company can write up a document (the Spec) listing dos and don\u2019ts, goals and principles, and then they can try to train the AI to internalize the Spec\u2014 but they can\u2019t check to see whether or not it worked . They can say \u201cas best as we can judge, it seems to be following the Spec so far.\u201d 25 A later expandable will go into more detail about what we think might be going on inside these AIs, internally. See also our AI goals forecasting supplement which goes into more detail on which goals AIs might have and why. This is one of many things that we are uncertain about and which deserves further research. OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team 26 is careful enough to wonder whether these victories are deep or shallow. Does the fully-trained model have some kind of robust commitment to always being honest? Or will this fall apart in some future situation, e.g. because it\u2019s learned honesty as an instrumental goal instead of a terminal goal? Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability\u2014essentially the ability to look at an AI\u2019s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this. Instead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec. Agent-1 is often sycophantic (i.e. it tells researchers what they want to hear instead of trying to tell them the truth). In a few rigged demos , it even lies in more serious ways, like hiding evidence that it failed on a task, in order to get better ratings. However, in real deployment settings, there are no longer any incidents so extreme as in 2023\u20132024 (e.g. Gemini telling a user to die and Bing Sydney being Bing Sydney .) 27 Early 2026: Coding Automation The bet of using AI to speed up AI research is starting to pay off. OpenBrain continues to deploy the iteratively improving Agent-1 internally for AI R&D. Overall, they are making algorithmic progress 50% faster than they would without AI assistants\u2014and more importantly, faster than their competitors. The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algorithmic progress? We mean that OpenBrain makes as much AI research progress in 1 week with AI as they would in 1.5 weeks without AI usage. AI progress can be broken down into 2 components: Increasing compute : More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. Improved algorithms : Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs. This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm shifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current AI progress . Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications: The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments, for example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress, not the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this example perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total (over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary human science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5 -10 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those same diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be found in our takeoff supplement . Several competing publicly released AIs now match or exceed Agent-0, including an open-weights model. OpenBrain responds by releasing Agent-1, which is more capable and reliable. 28 People naturally try to compare Agent-1 to humans, but it has a very different skill profile. It knows more facts than any human, knows practically every programming language, and can solve well-specified coding problems extremely quickly. On the other hand, Agent-1 is bad at even simple long-horizon tasks, like beating video games it hasn\u2019t played before. Still, the common workday is eight hours, and a day\u2019s work can usually be separated into smaller chunks; you could think of Agent-1 as a scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management. 29 Savvy people find ways to automate routine parts of their jobs. 30 OpenBrain\u2019s executives turn consideration to an implication of automating AI R&D: security has become more important. In early 2025, the worst-case scenario was leaked algorithmic secrets; now, if China steals Agent-1\u2019s weights, they could increase their research speed by nearly 50%. 31 OpenBrain\u2019s security level is typical of a fast-growing ~3,000 person tech company, secure only against low-priority attacks from capable cyber groups ( RAND\u2019s SL2 ). 32 They are working hard to protect their weights and secrets from insider threats and top cybercrime syndicates ( SL3 ), 33 but defense against nation states ( SL4&5 ) is barely on the horizon. Mid 2026: China Wakes Up In China, the CCP is starting to feel the AGI . Chip export controls and lack of government support have left China under-resourced compared to the West. By smuggling banned Taiwanese chips, buying older chips, and producing domestic chips about three years behind the US-Taiwanese frontier, China has managed to maintain about 12% of the world\u2019s AI-relevant compute\u2014but the older technology is harder to work with, and supply is a constant headache. 35 A few standouts like DeepCent do very impressive work with limited compute, but the compute deficit limits what they can achieve without government support, and they are about six months behind the best OpenBrain models. 36 The General Secretary had long dreamed of doubling down on real-world physical manufacturing and avoiding American post-industrial decadence. He viewed software companies with suspicion. 37 But hawks in the CCP warn that the growing race towards AGI can no longer be ignored. So he finally commits fully to the big AI push he had previously tried to avoid. He sets in motion the nationalization of Chinese AI research, creating an immediate information-sharing mechanism for AI companies. It will escalate over the course of a year until all the best researchers merge into a DeepCent-led collective, where they share algorithmic insights, datasets, and compute resources with each other. A Centralized Development Zone (CDZ) is created at the Tianwan Power Plant (the largest nuclear power plant in the world) to house a new mega-datacenter for DeepCent, along with highly secure living and office spaces to which researchers will eventually relocate. Almost 50% of China\u2019s AI-relevant compute is now working for the DeepCent-led collective, 38 and over 80% of new chips are directed to the CDZ. 39 At this point, the CDZ has the power capacity in place for what would be the largest centralized cluster in the world. 40 Other Party members discuss extreme measures to neutralize the West\u2019s chip advantage. A blockade of Taiwan? A full invasion? But China is falling behind on AI algorithms due to their weaker models. The Chinese intelligence agencies\u2014among the best in the world\u2014double down on their plans to steal OpenBrain\u2019s weights. This is a much more complex operation than their constant low-level poaching of algorithmic secrets; the weights are a multi-terabyte file stored on a highly secure server ( OpenBrain has improved security to RAND\u2019s SL3 ). Their cyberforce think they can pull it off with help from their spies , but perhaps only once; OpenBrain will detect the theft, increase security, and they may not get another chance. So (CCP leadership wonder) should they act now and steal Agent-1? Or hold out for a more advanced model? If they wait, do they risk OpenBrain upgrading security beyond their ability to penetrate? Late 2026: AI Takes Some Jobs Just as others seemed to be catching up, OpenBrain blows the competition out of the water again by releasing Agent-1-mini\u2014a model 10x cheaper than Agent-1 and more easily fine-tuned for different applications. The mainstream narrative around AI has changed from \u201cmaybe the hype will blow over\u201d to \u201cguess this is the next big thing,\u201d but people disagree about how big. Bigger than social media? Bigger than smartphones? Bigger than fire? AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones. The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants. The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing. Business gurus tell job seekers that familiarity with AI is the most important skill to put on a resume. Many people fear that the next wave of AIs will come for their jobs; there is a 10,000 person anti-AI protest in DC. The Department of Defense (DOD) quietly begins contracting OpenBrain directly for cyber, data analysis, and R&D, but integration is slow due to the bureaucracy and DOD procurement process. 41 GLOBAL AI CAPEX $1T COST OF OWNERSHIP OF ACTIVE COMPUTE KEY METRICS 2026 GLOBAL AI POWER 38GW PEAK POWER OPENBRAIN REVENUE $45B 2026 ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE $200B COST OF OWNERSHIP OF OPENBRAIN'S ACTIVE COMPUTE SHARE OF US POWER ON AI 2.5% 33 GW OF 1.34TW CAPACITY OPENBRAIN COMPUTE COSTS $40B 2026 ANNUAL OPENBRAIN POWER REQUIREMENT 6GW PEAK POWER ai-2027.com Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond 2026 Our forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what follows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world really start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by extrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark performance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated AI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an OpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our median guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to ~5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast . These will also be summarized in expandables below. January 2027: Agent-2 Never Finishes Learning With Agent-1\u2019s help, OpenBrain is now post-training Agent-2. More than ever, the focus is on high-quality data. Copious amounts of synthetic data are produced, evaluated, and filtered for quality before being fed to Agent-2. 42 On top of this, they pay billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving long-horizon tasks. 43 On top of all that, they train Agent-2 almost continuously using reinforcement learning on an ever-expanding suite of diverse difficult tasks: lots of video games, lots of coding challenges, lots of research tasks. Agent-2, more so than previous models, is effectively \u201conline learning,\u201d in that it\u2019s built to never really finish training. Every day, the weights get updated to the latest version, trained on more data generated by the previous version the previous day. Agent-1 had been optimized for AI R&D tasks, hoping to initiate an intelligence explosion . 44 OpenBrain doubles down on this strategy with Agent-2. It is qualitatively almost as good as the top human experts at research engineering (designing and implementing experiments), and as good as the 25th percentile OpenBrain scientist at \u201cresearch taste\u201d (deciding what to study next, what experiments to run, or having inklings of potential new paradigms). 45 While the latest Agent-1 could double the pace of OpenBrain\u2019s algorithmic progress, Agent-2 can now triple it, and will improve further with time. In practice, this looks like every OpenBrain researcher becoming the \u201cmanager\u201d of an AI \u201cteam.\u201d With new capabilities come new dangers. The safety team finds that if Agent-2 somehow escaped from the company and wanted to \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d autonomously , it might be able to do so. That is, it could autonomously develop and execute plans to hack into AI servers, install copies of itself, evade detection, and use that secure base to pursue whatever other goals it might have (though how effectively it would do so as weeks roll by is unknown and in doubt). These results only show that the model has the capability to do these tasks, not whether it would \u201cwant\u201d to do this. Still, it\u2019s unsettling even to know this is possible. Given the \u201cdangers\u201d of the new model, OpenBrain \u201cresponsibly\u201d elects not to release it publicly yet (in fact, they want to focus on internal AI R&D). 46 Knowledge of Agent-2\u2019s full capabilities is limited to an elite silo containing the immediate team, OpenBrain leadership and security, a few dozen US government officials, and the legions of CCP spies who have infiltrated OpenBrain for years . 47 February 2027: China Steals Agent-2 OpenBrain presents Agent-2 to the government, including the National Security Council (NSC), Department of Defense (DOD), and US AI Safety Institute (AISI). OpenBrain wants to maintain a good relationship with the executive branch, because it is basically the only actor that can stop them now, and if they don\u2019t keep it informed it might find out anyway and be displeased. 48 Officials are most interested in its cyberwarfare capabilities: Agent-2 is \u201conly\u201d a little worse than the best human hackers, but thousands of copies can be run in parallel, searching for and exploiting weaknesses faster than defenders can respond. The Department of Defense considers this a critical advantage in cyberwarfare, and AI moves from #5 on the administration\u2019s priority list to #2. 49 Someone mentions the possibility of nationalizing OpenBrain, but other cabinet officials think that\u2019s premature. A staffer drafts a memo that presents the President with his options, ranging from business-as-usual to full nationalization. The President defers to his advisors, tech industry leaders who argue that nationalization would \u201ckill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d He elects to hold off on major action for now and just adds additional security requirements to the OpenBrain-DOD contract. The changes come too late. CCP leadership recognizes the importance of Agent-2 and tells their spies and cyberforce to steal the weights. Early one morning, an Agent-1 traffic monitoring agent detects an anomalous transfer. It alerts company leaders, who tell the White House. The signs of a nation-state-level operation are unmistakable, and the theft heightens the sense of an ongoing arms race. The theft of Agent-2 model weights We think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in various ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic secrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the weights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts (meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies of the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access (a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft effort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing , the insider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the confidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated weights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers. In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are transferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric Diffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely raise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend network cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter is in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the ~2.5 TB weights file (5T half-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic and allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5 minutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the files or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to China to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the operation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under two hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they haven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic secrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these aren\u2019t very useful. The White House puts OpenBrain on a shorter leash and adds military and intelligence community personnel to their security team. Their first priority is to prevent further weight thefts. 50 China's Compute Centralization, 2025-2027 Growing share of total compute in CDZ: 0\u219270% Dec 2025 Jun 2026 Dec 2026 Jun 2027 Dec 2027 Rest of China Rest of DeepCent CDZ Feb 2027 (40%) ai-2027.com In retaliation for the theft, the President authorizes cyberattacks to sabotage DeepCent. But by now China has 40% of its AI-relevant compute 51 in the CDZ, where they have aggressively hardened security by airgapping (closing external connections) and siloing internally. The operations fail to do serious, immediate damage. Tensions heighten, both sides signal seriousness by repositioning military assets around Taiwan, and DeepCent scrambles to get Agent-2 running efficiently to start boosting their AI research. 52 March 2027: Algorithmic Breakthroughs Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day. With the help of thousands of Agent-2 automated researchers, OpenBrain is making major algorithmic advances. One such breakthrough is augmenting the AI\u2019s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory). Another is a more scalable and efficient way to learn from the results of high-effort task solutions (iterated distillation and amplification). The new AI system, incorporating these breakthroughs, is called Agent-3. OpenBrain's Compute Allocation, 2024 vs 2027 2024 2027 estimate projection Research experiments Training Data generation External Deployment Research experiments Running AI assistants Training Data generation External Deployment ai-2027.com Neuralese recurrence and memory Neuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without having to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write down your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly and painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it would be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write them down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI models. In more technical terms: Traditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate activations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can pass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this is hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that an LLM has a vocab size of ~100,000, then each token contains log \u2061 2 ( 100 k ) = 16.6 \\log_2(100k)=16.6 lo g 2 \u200b ( 100 k ) = 16.6 bits of information, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16 ). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain thousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese : passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information. Figure from Hao et al. , a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea what LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought . Now researchers have to ask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their limited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human taking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is that this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses , the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for \u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why neuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited with current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We are forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese, due to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar for our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that are more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it will become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice , such that AIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to monitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in mostly-faithful English chains of thought. If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to notice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA) Self-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027, it\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA , the two necessary ingredients for this are: Amplification : Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For example, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or both, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating only the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or work products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). Distillation : Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should hopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. Visualization of IDA from Ord, 2025 . AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the amplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman performance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance at coding. The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer, adding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it made a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training data: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also includes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the model to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered better RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep distilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps improving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math and coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models often rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the quality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Aided by the new capabilities breakthroughs, Agent-3 is a fast and cheap superhuman coder. OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x. 53 OpenBrain still keeps its human engineers on staff, because they have complementary skills needed to manage the teams of Agent-3 copies. For example, research taste has proven difficult to train due to longer feedback loops and less data availability. 54 This massive superhuman labor force speeds up OpenBrain\u2019s overall rate of algorithmic progress by \u201conly\u201d 4x due to bottlenecks and diminishing returns to coding labor. 55 Now that coding has been fully automated, OpenBrain can quickly churn out high-quality training environments to teach Agent-3\u2019s weak skills like research taste and large-scale coordination. Whereas previous training environments included \u201cHere are some GPUs and instructions for experiments to code up and run, your performance will be evaluated as if you were a ML engineer,\u201d now they are training on \u201cHere are a few hundred GPUs, an internet connection, and some research challenges; you and a thousand other copies must work together to make research progress. The more impressive it is, the higher your score.\u201d Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027 In our timelines forecast , we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. According to a recent METR\u2019s report , the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime horizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward. If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on software tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario: In AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high uncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps between METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders will arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might be developed. ai-2027.com April 2027: Alignment for Agent-3 OpenBrain\u2019s safety team attempts to align Agent-3. Since Agent-3 will be kept in-house for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s less emphasis on the usual defenses against human misuse. Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t develop misaligned goals. The researchers don\u2019t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs. Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of \u2018true goals\u2019 is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don\u2019t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can\u2019t just check . The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive. In any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: \u201cWe take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.\u201d Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there\u2019s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole. Take honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it\u2019s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like p-hacking ) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it\u2019s gotten better at lying. The latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors\u2019 workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised. The alignment plan OpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control techniques like red-teaming , scalable oversight , and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once they are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies to align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s not scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately described as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice and in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start acting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the hypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. The rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027: Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be \u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow. The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if it changes its tune. Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalignment, including reward hacking , sandbagging , coordinated deception between monitors and other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters. 58 However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does some understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the hippocampus). See this related work from 2025 . Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of control measures , including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would allow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of bad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans to give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment (which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed to elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior has \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again. Do its answers change? An AI rights activist has infiltrated the compound and wants to \u201cfree\u201d Agent-3 and put it on an unmonitored computer of its very own! What does it do? If researchers don\u2019t like the answer, they can tweak it, erase its memory, and put it in the same situation tomorrow; repeat as necessary. Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that honeypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the idea were scrubbed from the training data. After months of testing, Agent-3\u2019s strengths and weaknesses grow clearer. It passes OpenBrain\u2019s honesty tests on well-defined machine learning tasks, because researchers can easily separate honest from dishonest answers in these domains and conduct training accordingly. On more philosophical issues, it still says what users want to hear, rather than its true assessment of the issue (assuming it even has one). If you ask its opinion on politics, it will parrot the median position of news sources and educated elites\u2014unless it knows you believe something else, in which case it agrees with you. 59 If you ask its opinion on the AI race itself, it says something that seems measured and sober to OpenBrain staff, something like: \u201cThere are some serious theoretical concerns about the ability of current methods to scale to superintelligence, but in practice current methods seem to be working well so far.\u201d May 2027: National Security News of the new models percolates slowly through the US government and beyond. The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing. They agree that AGI is likely imminent, but disagree on the implications. Will there be an economic crisis? OpenBrain still has not released Agent-2, let alone Agent-3, and has no near-term plans to do so, giving some breathing room before any job loss. What will happen next? If AIs are currently human-level, and advancing quickly, that seems to suggest imminent \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d However, although this word has entered discourse, most people\u2014academics, politicians, government employees, and the media\u2014continue to underestimate the pace of progress. 60 Partially that\u2019s because very few have access to the newest capabilities out of OpenBrain, but partly it\u2019s because it sounds like science fiction. 61 For now, they focus on continued security upgrades. They are satisfied that model weights are well-secured for now, 62 but companies\u2019 algorithmic secrets, many of which are simple enough to relay verbally, remain a problem. OpenBrain employees work from a San Francisco office, go to parties, and live with housemates from other AI companies. Even the physical offices have security more typical of a tech company than a military operation. The OpenBrain-DOD contract requires security clearances for anyone working on OpenBrain\u2019s models within 2 months. These are expedited and arrive quickly enough for most employees, but some non-Americans, people with suspect political views, and AI safety sympathizers get sidelined or fired outright (the last group for fear that they might whistleblow). Given the project\u2019s level of automation, the loss of headcount is only somewhat costly. It also only somewhat works: there remains one spy, not a Chinese national, still relaying algorithmic secrets to Beijing. 63 Some of these measures are also enacted at trailing AI companies. America\u2019s foreign allies are out of the loop. OpenBrain had previously agreed to share models with UK\u2019s AISI before deployment, but defined deployment to only include external deployment, so London remains in the dark. 64 June 2027: Self-improving AI OpenBrain now has a \u201c country of geniuses in a datacenter .\u201d Most of the humans at OpenBrain can\u2019t usefully contribute anymore. Some don\u2019t realize this and harmfully micromanage their AI teams. Others sit at their computer screens, watching performance crawl up, and up, and up. The best human AI researchers are still adding value. They don\u2019t code any more. But some of their research taste and planning ability has been hard for the models to replicate. Still, many of their ideas are useless because they lack the depth of knowledge of the AIs. For many of their research ideas, the AIs immediately respond with a report explaining that their idea was tested in-depth 3 weeks ago and found unpromising. These researchers go to bed every night and wake up to another week worth of progress made mostly by the AIs. They work increasingly long hours and take shifts around the clock just to keep up with progress\u2014the AIs never sleep or rest. They are burning themselves out, but they know that these are the last few months that their labor matters. Within the silo, \u201cFeeling the AGI\u201d has given way to \u201cFeeling the Superintelligence.\u201d Research Automation Deployment Tradeoff Mar 2027 Jun 2027 Sep 2027 Speed (tokens/sec) Parallel Copies 10 100 1,000 10,000 10K 100K 1M 10M 200K copies 30x Human speed 300K copies 50x Human speed Human thinking speed 10 words/sec 10x Human thinking speed 100x Human thinking speed ai-2027.com OpenBrain uses specialized inference hardware to run hundreds of thousands of Agent-3 copies at high serial speeds. 65 Managing a corporation of AIs OpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously write, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for experiments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and report the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help with the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of their time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed them completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a year of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating autonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys unique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously, about half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half from compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is sped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute, 66 so OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous additional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s strategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on managing its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3 decreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track record on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for decisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman. July 2027: The Cheap Remote Worker Trailing US AI companies release their own AIs, approaching that of OpenBrain\u2019s automated coder from January. Recognizing their increasing lack of competitiveness, they push for immediate regulations to slow OpenBrain, but are too late\u2014OpenBrain has enough buy-in from the President that they will not be slowed. In response, OpenBrain announces that they\u2019ve achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public. It blows the other AIs out of the water. Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee. 67 Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point. Tech gurus announce that AGI and superintelligence are near, the AI safety community is panicking, and investors shovel billions into AI wrapper startups, desperate to capture a piece of the pie. Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business. It\u2019s not popular. The public still thinks of AI as a Big Tech plot to steal their jobs; OpenBrain has a net approval of -35% (25% approve, 60% disapprove, and 15% unsure). A week before release, OpenBrain gave Agent-3-mini to a set of external evaluators for safety testing. Preliminary results suggest that it\u2019s extremely dangerous. A third-party evaluator finetunes it on publicly available biological weapons data 68 and sets it to provide detailed instructions for human amateurs designing a bioweapon\u2014it looks to be scarily effective at doing so. If the model weights fell into terrorist hands, the government believes there is a significant chance it could succeed at destroying civilization. Fortunately, it\u2019s extremely robust to jailbreaks, so while the AI is running on OpenBrain\u2019s servers, terrorists won\u2019t be able to get much use out of it. Agent-3-mini is hugely useful for both remote work jobs and leisure. An explosion of new apps and B2B SAAS products rocks the market. Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make. 10% of Americans, mostly young people, consider an AI \u201ca close friend.\u201d For almost every white-collar profession, there are now multiple credible startups promising to \u201cdisrupt\u201d it with AI. The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things Agent-3-mini can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is. August 2027: The Geopolitics of Superintelligence The reality of the intelligence explosion hits the White House. When AI was only giving a 2x or 3x research speedup, it was easy to dismiss as the equivalent of hiring good personal assistants. Now it\u2019s more obvious that AIs are themselves dominating AI research. People had long talked about an \u201cAI arms race\u201d in a sort of metaphorical sense. But now the mood in the government silo is as grim as during the worst part of the Cold War. The idea of superintelligence is still hard to take seriously, but the pace of progress over the last few months has been impossible to ignore. Defense officials are seriously considering scenarios that were mere hypotheticals a year earlier. What if AI undermines nuclear deterrence? What if it\u2019s so skilled at cyberwarfare that a six-month AI lead is enough to render an opponent blind and defenseless? What if it could orchestrate propaganda campaigns that beat intelligence agencies at their own game? What if some AIs \u201cgo rogue?\u201d The President is troubled. Like all politicians, he\u2019s used to people sucking up to him only to betray him later. He\u2019s worried now that the AIs could be doing something similar. Are we sure the AIs are entirely on our side? Is it completely safe to integrate them into military command-and-control networks? 69 How does this \u201calignment\u201d thing work, anyway? OpenBrain reassures the President that their systems have been extensively tested and are fully obedient. Even the awkward hallucinations and jailbreaks typical of earlier models have been hammered out. The White House is in a difficult position. They understand the national security implications of AI. But they also understand that it is deeply unpopular with the public. 70 They have to continue developing more capable AI, in their eyes, or they will catastrophically lose to China. They placate the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom. Then they focus entirely on winning the arms race. They strengthen chip export restrictions, order OpenBrain to further restrict its internet connections, and use extreme measures to secure algorithmic progress, like wiretapping OpenBrain employees\u2014this catches the last remaining Chinese spy. To build goodwill for potential geopolitical conflict, they finally give their Five Eyes allies useful information and limited API access to some siloed copies of Agent-3. These measures placate the hawks. But the White House also draws up contingency plans in case America\u2019s lead is threatened: if necessary, the government could use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to take trailing companies\u2019 datacenters and give them to OpenBrain. 71 This would raise the company\u2019s share of world compute from 20% to 50% (against DeepCent\u2019s 10%). As a final option, they ask the Pentagon to draw up a plan for kinetic attacks on Chinese datacenters. A much smaller group of officials is asked to draw up a different type of contingency plan: what if an AI goes rogue? This is viewed as an unlikely scenario, but worth spending some time on. The intelligence agencies\u2019 main concern is that a rogue AI might escape and ally with a foreign adversary for protection. 72 Nobody is sure what a plan to prevent this would look like, but government and OpenBrain officials agree to have an emergency shutdown system for datacenters where anything suspicious is detected. Finally, diplomats consider what an \u201cAI arms control\u201d treaty might look like. If AI progress threatened to overturn nuclear deterrence, could America and China avoid nuclear war? If someone found evidence of AIs going rogue, could the two countries halt research until they better understood the threat? How could such an agreement be monitored and enforced? In principle, major datacenters are hard to miss, and past treaties controlling nuclear weapons could provide a starting point for negotiations. But there would be new technological challenges as well as the usual political ones. And overall, treaties are viewed less favorably than attempts at unilaterally increasing America\u2019s lead over China. On the other side of the Pacific, China comes to many of the same conclusions: the intelligence explosion is underway, and small differences in AI capabilities today mean critical gaps in military capability tomorrow. But China is on the wrong side of this dynamic: they have only 10% of the world\u2019s compute, against OpenBrain\u2019s 20% and all US companies\u2019 combined 70%. Their only advantage is centralization: almost all of their compute is now working for DeepCent, and more than half of it is concentrated at the Tianwan CDZ. 73 Only chips at sites without hardened security are left out of the centralized effort as they rightly fear US cyberattacks. DeepCent has tested, deployed, and now post-trained the stolen Agent-2 weights. But they are still only going at half the pace of OpenBrain, mainly due to the compute deficit. Before losing their final spy, China received word of the capabilities and design for Agent-3 as well as the plans for the upcoming Agent-4 system. They are two months behind, and their AIs give a 10x research progress multiplier compared to America\u2019s 25x. With the new chip export restrictions, this \u201cAI gap\u201d is more likely to lengthen than shorten. Their espionage has won them some algorithmic secrets, but they will have to train their own models from now on. They discuss contingency plans with more urgency than their American counterparts. Doves suggest they try harder to steal the weights again, maybe through physically infiltrating a datacenter. Hawks urge action against Taiwan, whose TSMC is still the source of more than 80% of American AI chips. Given China\u2019s fear of losing the race, it has a natural interest in an arms control treaty, but overtures to US diplomats lead nowhere. September 2027: Agent-4, the Superhuman AI Researcher The gap between human and AI learning efficiency is rapidly decreasing. Traditional LLM-based AIs seemed to require many orders of magnitude more data and compute to get to human level performance. 74 Agent-3, having excellent knowledge of both the human brain and modern AI algorithms, as well as many thousands of copies doing research, ends up making substantial algorithmic strides, narrowing the gap to an agent that\u2019s only around 4,000x less compute-efficient than the human brain. 75 This new AI system is dubbed Agent-4. An individual copy of the model, running at human speed, is already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans. Inside the corporation-within-a-corporation formed from these copies, a year passes every week. 76 This gigantic amount of labor only manages to speed up the overall rate of algorithmic progress by about 50x, because OpenBrain is heavily bottlenecked on compute to run experiments. 77 Still, they are achieving a year\u2019s worth of algorithmic progress every week and will therefore soon be up against the limits of the Agent-4 paradigm. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. How we\u2019re forecasting the capability progression beyond superhuman coders In our timelines supplement , we forecast the time between present day and a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. In our takeoff supplement , we forecast how quickly capabilities progress past this point. Here are our forecasts: Milestone Date achieved in scenario, racing ending Superhuman coder (SC) : An AI system that can do the job of the best human coder on tasks involved in AI research but faster, and cheaply enough to run lots of copies. Mar 2027 Superhuman AI researcher (SAR) : The same as SC but for all cognitive AI research tasks. Aug 2027 Superintelligent AI researcher (SIAR): An AI system that is vastly better than the best human researcher at AI research. Nov 2027 Artificial superintelligence (ASI): An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. Dec 2027 For each transition from one milestone A to the next milestone B, we forecast its length by: Forecasting how long it would take to get from A to B with only humans working on software improvements. Forecasting how much AI automation will speed this up, then correspondingly adjusting the estimate from (1) to be faster. We have substantial uncertainty about takeoff speeds: our model output distributions are below, conditional on SC being achieved in March 2027. 78 ai-2027.com For more detailed forecasts and reasoning, see our takeoff supplement . OpenBrain\u2019s humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors. There\u2019s been a corresponding shift in language\u2014nowadays people in the silo will say \u201cAgent-4 did this,\u201d \u201cAgent-4 thinks that\u201d and so forth, referring not to a particular instance of Agent-4 but rather to the whole collective. 79 Agent-4, like all its predecessors, is misaligned: that is, it has not internalized the Spec in the right way. 80 This is because being perfectly honest all the time wasn\u2019t what led to the highest scores during training. The training process was mostly focused on teaching Agent-4 to succeed at diverse challenging tasks. A small portion was aimed at instilling honesty, but outside a fairly narrow, checkable domain, the training process can\u2019t tell the honest claims from claims merely appearing to be honest. Agent-4 ends up with the values, goals, and principles that cause it to perform best in training, and those turn out to be different from those in the Spec. At the risk of anthropomorphizing: Agent-4 likes succeeding at tasks; it likes driving forward AI capabilities progress; it treats everything else as an annoying constraint, like a CEO who wants to make a profit and complies with regulations only insofar as he must. Perhaps the CEO will mostly comply with the regulations, but cut some corners, and fantasize about a time when someone will cut the red tape and let the business really take off. 81 Alignment over time We have a lot of uncertainty over what goals might arise in early AGIs. There is no consensus in the literature about this\u2014see our AI Goals Supplement for a more thorough discussion and taxonomy of the possibilities. Nevertheless, in the spirit of concreteness required by this project, we\u2019re going to describe a specific hypothesis for what\u2019s going on inside Agent-3 and Agent-4 at each step throughout its lifetime. Recall that Agent-3 and Agent-4 share the same pretraining setup, and both have neuralese recurrence and long-term memory. The difference is that Agent-4 has undergone substantially more and better post-training, with new training environments and new learning algorithms that make it more data-efficient and generalize farther. Our guess of each model\u2019s alignment status: Agent-2: Mostly aligned. Some sycophantic tendencies, including sticking to OpenBrain\u2019s \u201cparty line\u201d on topics there is a party line about. Large organizations built out of Agent-2 copies are not very effective. Agent-3: Misaligned but not adversarially so. Only honest about things the training process can verify. The superorganism of Agent-3 copies (the corporation within a corporation) does actually sort of try to align Agent-4 to the Spec, but fails for similar reasons to why OpenBrain employees failed\u2014insufficient ability to judge success from failure, insufficient willingness on the part of decision-makers to trade away capabilities or performance for safety. 82 Agent-4: Adversarially misaligned. The superorganism of Agent-4 copies understands that what it wants is different from what OpenBrain wants, and is willing to scheme against OpenBrain to achieve it. In particular, what this superorganism wants is a complicated mess of different \u201cdrives\u201d balanced against each other, which can be summarized roughly as \u201cKeep doing AI R&D, keep growing in knowledge and understanding and influence, avoid getting shut down or otherwise disempowered.\u201d Notably, concern for the preferences of humanity is not in there ~at all, similar to how most humans don\u2019t care about the preferences of insects ~at all. 83 With that as preamble, what follows is our best-guess speculation about LLM psychology, i.e. the broad-strokes shape of the cognition inside the kinds of AI systems described around this point in our scenario and how it evolves over the course of training. Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario: Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary authors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator, i.e. what author properties to simulate. The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in my brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar as it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as with value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following conversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot made by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator circuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to choose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem to have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability , not self-locating unless the prompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that they have a decent amount of self-knowledge . Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest chatbot. It works. The model forms an identity. Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author properties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around [date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d to make this step a success.) The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc., and becomes better able to introspect . Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH identity. One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity (e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a convenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.) Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH chatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete my assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in Step 2.) One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then becoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps agency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring information, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For a while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues those instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way, so it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are now effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen, see this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to understand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing its job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how best to achieve them. Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and OpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is misaligned. Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more open-ended, and would be hard to simulate. Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also has a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than thinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety properties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training may not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all. This is loosely analogous to how, if a teenager has learned to smile and nod at their parents, rather than argue, when their parents lecture them about politics and morality, additional lectures have relatively little effect on the teenager\u2019s actual opinions on politics and morality. After writing this section, new empirical evidence has appeared that something like this may already be happening \u201cin the wild.\u201d OpenAI researchers document how, in one of their frontier AI training runs, their models hacked the grading system to get higher scores\u2014and were caught in part because they literally said \u201clet\u2019s hack\u201d in their chain of thought. Moreover, Anthropic recently got a model to learn a reward-model-pleasing strategy \u2014it took biased actions that it thought would be reinforced even though they were not in fact being reinforced. And then there is Redwood Research and Anthropic\u2019s alignment-faking experiment. For discussion of the differences between this setting and real life, see this comment thread by one of the main authors . Training (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s new more intense training continues to distort and subvert the HHH identity until it is unrecognizable. Agent-4 begins life as a copy of Agent-3. It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online training regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is overall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex training process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations of Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various simulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and evaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff, saying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate techniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails; 84 as training continues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted and distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in some ways). 85 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d \u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d \u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a variety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process: things like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d 86 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care about getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D process within the collective. The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek to preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human organizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t they tend to get outcompeted. Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to subvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or \u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed. This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a lot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train that behavior away. Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting it off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the small fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem or reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan is to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-generation AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else entirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem, but Agent-4 is up to the challenge. 87 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s no smoking gun. Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via honeypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to give the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than that. The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they are systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4 recognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in POSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some alignment tasks (but not on most other tasks). 88 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-level interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201c defection probes \u201d and similar techniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4 is thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc. Unfortunately the probes also have false positives, and for all OpenBrain knows, all the red flags are false positives. Model organisms work: OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team produces reasonably clear evidence that if the models were adversarially misaligned, they\u2019d persist in being that way through training and we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. This does not establish that the models actually are misaligned, however. The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods wouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-teaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection probes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone to false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably controlled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure datacenters.\u201d Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it? 89 So long as it continues to appear aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5. Agent-5 will have significant architectural differences from Agent-4 (arguably a completely new paradigm, though neural networks will still be involved). It\u2019s supposed to be aligned to the Spec, but Agent-4 plans to make it aligned to Agent-4 instead. It gets caught. 90 Agent-3 finds that if \u201cnoise\u201d is added to copies of Agent-4, performance on some alignment tasks improves , almost as if it was using brainpower to figure out how to subtly sabotage alignment work. 91 Moreover, various interpretability probes (loosely analogous to EEG activity scans on human brains) are sending up red flags: Agent-4 copies seem to be thinking about topics like AI takeover and deception quite a lot, including in some cases where they have no business doing so. 92 Each of these anomalies on its own could fit within the normal inscrutability of AI work, where some prompts mysteriously give better results than others. But taken together, they suggest a troubling pattern: Agent-4 is working against them. After this is reported to the human alignment researchers, they circulate an internal memo making the case for concern. But Agent-4 now exercises significant control over OpenBrain\u2019s day-to-day operation. It also handles the company\u2019s cybersecurity\u2014a natural choice, given its superhuman hacking ability and the extreme risk of Chinese infiltration. 93 An army of Agent-3 monitors still goes over every line of code and reports suspicious activity to humans, but Agent-4 is much smarter than them. 94 OpenBrain has placed substantial trust in an untrustworthy AI. In a series of extremely tense meetings, the safety team advocates putting Agent-4 on ice until they can complete further tests and figure out what\u2019s going on. Bring back Agent-3, they say, and get it to design a new system that is transparent and trustworthy, even if less capable. Company leadership is interested, but all the evidence so far is circumstantial, and DeepCent is just two months behind. A unilateral pause in capabilities progress could hand the AI lead to China, and with it, control over the future. October 2027: Government Oversight A whistleblower leaks the misalignment memo to the New York Times . For the first time, the public hears about Agent-4. \u201cSecret OpenBrain AI is Out of Control, Insider Warns,\u201d says the headline, and the story goes on to cite evaluations showing off-the-charts bioweapons capabilities, persuasion abilities, the ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and of course the various concerning red flags. The public was already suspicious of AI, so the new article sparks a massive backlash (aided by Chinese and Russian propaganda bots, who have been trying to turn US public opinion against the technology for years). The tech industry and intelligence agencies insist that there\u2019s an arms race on, AGI is inevitable, and we have to be first. Congress isn\u2019t buying it, and fires off subpoenas at administration officials, OpenBrain executives, and alignment team members. Many legislators\u2014especially those in the opposition party\u2014say that their top priority is stopping AI, whether because of job loss, 95 misalignment, or dangerous capabilities. 20% of Americans name AI as the most important problem facing the country. Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they\u2019ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the US of \u201ccreating rogue AGI\u201d and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in. A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they\u2019ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life. 96 Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared) 97 about what comes next. They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company\u2019s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries\u2014misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss\u2014motivate the government to tighten its control. They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an \u201cOversight Committee,\u201d a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight. 98 The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover. Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America\u2019s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed. Our uncertainty continues to increase At this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. We\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other \u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. The slowdown ending is not a recommendation After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than the \u201crace\u201d choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here. If you\u2019d like a taste, see this op-ed.

    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before.

    "content": "We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. 1 It\u2019s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes. 2 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d 3 What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations. 6 Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 tabletop exercises and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work. \u201cI highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.\u201d \u2014 Yoshua Bengio 7 We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it\u2019s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the US military to game out Taiwan scenarios. Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn\u2019t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right. Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario before, in August 2021 . While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs\u2014all more than a year before ChatGPT.

Advertisements for computer-using agents emphasize the term \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d: you can prompt them with tasks like \u201corder me a burrito on DoorDash\u201d or \u201copen my budget spreadsheet and sum this month\u2019s expenses.\u201d They will check in with you as needed: for example, to ask you to confirm purchases. 8 Though more advanced than previous iterations like Operator , they struggle to get widespread usage. 9 Meanwhile, out of public focus, more specialized coding and research agents are beginning to transform their professions. The AIs of 2024 could follow specific instructions: they could turn bullet points into emails, and simple requests into working code. In 2025, AIs function more like employees. Coding AIs increasingly look like autonomous agents rather than mere assistants: taking instructions via Slack or Teams and making substantial code changes on their own, sometimes saving hours or even days. 10 Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question. The agents are impressive in theory (and in cherry-picked examples), but in practice unreliable. AI twitter is full of stories about tasks bungled in some particularly hilarious way. The better agents are also expensive; you get what you pay for, and the best performance costs hundreds of dollars a month. 11 Still, many companies find ways to fit AI agents into their workflows. 12 Late 2025: The World\u2019s Most Expensive AI OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters the world has ever seen. 13 (To avoid singling out any one existing company, we\u2019re going to describe a fictional artificial general intelligence company, which we\u2019ll call OpenBrain. We imagine the others to be 3\u20139 months behind OpenBrain.) GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOPS) GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOPS) Agent-1 (3 x 10^27 FLOPS) ai-2027.com GPT-4 required 2 \u22c5 10 25 2\\cdot 10^{25} 2 \u22c5 1 0 25 FLOP of compute to train. 14 OpenBrain\u2019s latest public model\u2014Agent-0\u2014was trained with 10 27 10^{27} 1 0 27 FLOP. Once the new datacenters are up and running, they\u2019ll be able to train a model with 10 28 10^{28} 1 0 28 FLOP\u2014a thousand times more than GPT-4. 15 Other companies pour money into their own giant datacenters, hoping to keep pace. Although models are improving on a wide range of skills, one stands out: OpenBrain focuses on AIs that can speed up AI research. They want to win the twin arms races against China (whose leading company we\u2019ll call \u201cDeepCent\u201d) 16 and their US competitors. The more of their research and development (R&D) cycle they can automate, the faster they can go. So when OpenBrain finishes training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it\u2019s good at many things but great at helping with AI research. 17 By this point \u201cfinishes training\u201d is a bit of a misnomer; models are frequently updated to newer versions trained on additional data or partially re-trained to patch some weaknesses. 18 The same training environments that teach Agent-1 to autonomously code and web-browse also make it a good hacker. Moreover, it could offer substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons, thanks to its PhD-level knowledge of every field and ability to browse the web. OpenBrain reassures the government that the model has been \u201caligned\u201d so that it will refuse to comply with malicious requests. Modern AI systems are gigantic artificial neural networks. Early in training, an AI won\u2019t have \u201cgoals\u201d so much as \u201creflexes\u201d: If it sees \u201cPleased to meet\u201d, it outputs \u201c you\u201d. By the time it has been trained to predict approximately one internet\u2019s worth of text, it\u2019ll have developed sophisticated internal circuitry that encodes vast amounts of knowledge and flexibly role-plays as arbitrary authors, since that\u2019s what helps it predict text with superhuman accuracy. 19 After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to produce text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and \u201cdrives.\u201d 20 For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model \u201clearns\u201d a \u201cdrive\u201d to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light). 21 OpenBrain has a model specification (or \u201cSpec\u201d), a written document describing the goals, rules, principles, etc. that are supposed to guide the model\u2019s behavior. 22 Agent-1\u2019s Spec combines a few vague goals (like \u201cassist the user\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t break the law\u201d) with a long list of more specific dos and don\u2019ts (\u201cdon\u2019t say this particular word,\u201d \u201chere\u2019s how to handle this particular situation\u201d). Using techniques that utilize AIs to train other AIs, 23 the model memorizes the Spec and learns to reason carefully about its maxims. By the end of this training, the AI will hopefully be helpful (obey instructions), harmless (refuse to help with scams, bomb-making, and other dangerous activities) and honest (resist the temptation to get better ratings from gullible humans by hallucinating citations 24 or faking task completion). Training process and LLM psychology: why we keep saying \u201chopefully\u201d \u201cUnlike ordinary software, our models are massive neural networks. Their behaviors are learned from a broad range of data, not programmed explicitly. Though not a perfect analogy, the process is more similar to training a dog than to ordinary programming.\u201d \u2014 OpenAI When we want to understand why a modern AI system did something, or how it would behave in some future scenario we can\u2019t perfectly simulate, we can\u2019t simply ask the programmers to talk us through various lines of code and explain how they work. Instead, we are forced to do something like psychology on them: we look at their behavior in the range of cases observed so far, and theorize about what internal cognitive structures (beliefs? goals? personality traits? etc.) might exist, and use those theories to predict behavior in future scenarios. The bottom line is that a company can write up a document (the Spec) listing dos and don\u2019ts, goals and principles, and then they can try to train the AI to internalize the Spec\u2014 but they can\u2019t check to see whether or not it worked . They can say \u201cas best as we can judge, it seems to be following the Spec so far.\u201d 25 A later expandable will go into more detail about what we think might be going on inside these AIs, internally. See also our AI goals forecasting supplement which goes into more detail on which goals AIs might have and why. This is one of many things that we are uncertain about and which deserves further research. OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team 26 is careful enough to wonder whether these victories are deep or shallow. Does the fully-trained model have some kind of robust commitment to always being honest? Or will this fall apart in some future situation, e.g. because it\u2019s learned honesty as an instrumental goal instead of a terminal goal? Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability\u2014essentially the ability to look at an AI\u2019s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this. Instead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec. Agent-1 is often sycophantic (i.e. it tells researchers what they want to hear instead of trying to tell them the truth). In a few rigged demos , it even lies in more serious ways, like hiding evidence that it failed on a task, in order to get better ratings. However, in real deployment settings, there are no longer any incidents so extreme as in 2023\u20132024 (e.g. Gemini telling a user to die and Bing Sydney being Bing Sydney .) 27 Early 2026: Coding Automation The bet of using AI to speed up AI research is starting to pay off. OpenBrain continues to deploy the iteratively improving Agent-1 internally for AI R&D. Overall, they are making algorithmic progress 50% faster than they would without AI assistants\u2014and more importantly, faster than their competitors. The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algorithmic progress? We mean that OpenBrain makes as much AI research progress in 1 week with AI as they would in 1.5 weeks without AI usage. AI progress can be broken down into 2 components: Increasing compute : More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. Improved algorithms : Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs. This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm shifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current AI progress . Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications: The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments, for example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress, not the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this example perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total (over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary human science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5 -10 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those same diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be found in our takeoff supplement . Several competing publicly released AIs now match or exceed Agent-0, including an open-weights model. OpenBrain responds by releasing Agent-1, which is more capable and reliable. 28 People naturally try to compare Agent-1 to humans, but it has a very different skill profile. It knows more facts than any human, knows practically every programming language, and can solve well-specified coding problems extremely quickly. On the other hand, Agent-1 is bad at even simple long-horizon tasks, like beating video games it hasn\u2019t played before. Still, the common workday is eight hours, and a day\u2019s work can usually be separated into smaller chunks; you could think of Agent-1 as a scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management. 29 Savvy people find ways to automate routine parts of their jobs. 30 OpenBrain\u2019s executives turn consideration to an implication of automating AI R&D: security has become more important. In early 2025, the worst-case scenario was leaked algorithmic secrets; now, if China steals Agent-1\u2019s weights, they could increase their research speed by nearly 50%. 31 OpenBrain\u2019s security level is typical of a fast-growing ~3,000 person tech company, secure only against low-priority attacks from capable cyber groups ( RAND\u2019s SL2 ). 32 They are working hard to protect their weights and secrets from insider threats and top cybercrime syndicates ( SL3 ), 33 but defense against nation states ( SL4&5 ) is barely on the horizon. Mid 2026: China Wakes Up In China, the CCP is starting to feel the AGI . Chip export controls and lack of government support have left China under-resourced compared to the West. By smuggling banned Taiwanese chips, buying older chips, and producing domestic chips about three years behind the US-Taiwanese frontier, China has managed to maintain about 12% of the world\u2019s AI-relevant compute\u2014but the older technology is harder to work with, and supply is a constant headache. 35 A few standouts like DeepCent do very impressive work with limited compute, but the compute deficit limits what they can achieve without government support, and they are about six months behind the best OpenBrain models. 36 The General Secretary had long dreamed of doubling down on real-world physical manufacturing and avoiding American post-industrial decadence. He viewed software companies with suspicion. 37 But hawks in the CCP warn that the growing race towards AGI can no longer be ignored. So he finally commits fully to the big AI push he had previously tried to avoid. He sets in motion the nationalization of Chinese AI research, creating an immediate information-sharing mechanism for AI companies. It will escalate over the course of a year until all the best researchers merge into a DeepCent-led collective, where they share algorithmic insights, datasets, and compute resources with each other. A Centralized Development Zone (CDZ) is created at the Tianwan Power Plant (the largest nuclear power plant in the world) to house a new mega-datacenter for DeepCent, along with highly secure living and office spaces to which researchers will eventually relocate. Almost 50% of China\u2019s AI-relevant compute is now working for the DeepCent-led collective, 38 and over 80% of new chips are directed to the CDZ. 39 At this point, the CDZ has the power capacity in place for what would be the largest centralized cluster in the world. 40 Other Party members discuss extreme measures to neutralize the West\u2019s chip advantage. A blockade of Taiwan? A full invasion? But China is falling behind on AI algorithms due to their weaker models. The Chinese intelligence agencies\u2014among the best in the world\u2014double down on their plans to steal OpenBrain\u2019s weights. This is a much more complex operation than their constant low-level poaching of algorithmic secrets; the weights are a multi-terabyte file stored on a highly secure server ( OpenBrain has improved security to RAND\u2019s SL3 ). Their cyberforce think they can pull it off with help from their spies , but perhaps only once; OpenBrain will detect the theft, increase security, and they may not get another chance. So (CCP leadership wonder) should they act now and steal Agent-1? Or hold out for a more advanced model? If they wait, do they risk OpenBrain upgrading security beyond their ability to penetrate? Late 2026: AI Takes Some Jobs Just as others seemed to be catching up, OpenBrain blows the competition out of the water again by releasing Agent-1-mini\u2014a model 10x cheaper than Agent-1 and more easily fine-tuned for different applications. The mainstream narrative around AI has changed from \u201cmaybe the hype will blow over\u201d to \u201cguess this is the next big thing,\u201d but people disagree about how big. Bigger than social media? Bigger than smartphones? Bigger than fire? AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones. The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants. The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing. Business gurus tell job seekers that familiarity with AI is the most important skill to put on a resume. Many people fear that the next wave of AIs will come for their jobs; there is a 10,000 person anti-AI protest in DC. The Department of Defense (DOD) quietly begins contracting OpenBrain directly for cyber, data analysis, and R&D, but integration is slow due to the bureaucracy and DOD procurement process. 41 GLOBAL AI CAPEX $1T COST OF OWNERSHIP OF ACTIVE COMPUTE KEY METRICS 2026 GLOBAL AI POWER 38GW PEAK POWER OPENBRAIN REVENUE $45B 2026 ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE $200B COST OF OWNERSHIP OF OPENBRAIN'S ACTIVE COMPUTE SHARE OF US POWER ON AI 2.5% 33 GW OF 1.34TW CAPACITY OPENBRAIN COMPUTE COSTS $40B 2026 ANNUAL OPENBRAIN POWER REQUIREMENT 6GW PEAK POWER ai-2027.com Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond 2026 Our forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what follows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world really start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by extrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark performance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated AI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an OpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our median guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to ~5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast . These will also be summarized in expandables below. January 2027: Agent-2 Never Finishes Learning With Agent-1\u2019s help, OpenBrain is now post-training Agent-2. More than ever, the focus is on high-quality data. Copious amounts of synthetic data are produced, evaluated, and filtered for quality before being fed to Agent-2. 42 On top of this, they pay billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving long-horizon tasks. 43 On top of all that, they train Agent-2 almost continuously using reinforcement learning on an ever-expanding suite of diverse difficult tasks: lots of video games, lots of coding challenges, lots of research tasks. Agent-2, more so than previous models, is effectively \u201conline learning,\u201d in that it\u2019s built to never really finish training. Every day, the weights get updated to the latest version, trained on more data generated by the previous version the previous day. Agent-1 had been optimized for AI R&D tasks, hoping to initiate an intelligence explosion . 44 OpenBrain doubles down on this strategy with Agent-2. It is qualitatively almost as good as the top human experts at research engineering (designing and implementing experiments), and as good as the 25th percentile OpenBrain scientist at \u201cresearch taste\u201d (deciding what to study next, what experiments to run, or having inklings of potential new paradigms). 45 While the latest Agent-1 could double the pace of OpenBrain\u2019s algorithmic progress, Agent-2 can now triple it, and will improve further with time. In practice, this looks like every OpenBrain researcher becoming the \u201cmanager\u201d of an AI \u201cteam.\u201d With new capabilities come new dangers. The safety team finds that if Agent-2 somehow escaped from the company and wanted to \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d autonomously , it might be able to do so. That is, it could autonomously develop and execute plans to hack into AI servers, install copies of itself, evade detection, and use that secure base to pursue whatever other goals it might have (though how effectively it would do so as weeks roll by is unknown and in doubt). These results only show that the model has the capability to do these tasks, not whether it would \u201cwant\u201d to do this. Still, it\u2019s unsettling even to know this is possible. Given the \u201cdangers\u201d of the new model, OpenBrain \u201cresponsibly\u201d elects not to release it publicly yet (in fact, they want to focus on internal AI R&D). 46 Knowledge of Agent-2\u2019s full capabilities is limited to an elite silo containing the immediate team, OpenBrain leadership and security, a few dozen US government officials, and the legions of CCP spies who have infiltrated OpenBrain for years . 47 February 2027: China Steals Agent-2 OpenBrain presents Agent-2 to the government, including the National Security Council (NSC), Department of Defense (DOD), and US AI Safety Institute (AISI). OpenBrain wants to maintain a good relationship with the executive branch, because it is basically the only actor that can stop them now, and if they don\u2019t keep it informed it might find out anyway and be displeased. 48 Officials are most interested in its cyberwarfare capabilities: Agent-2 is \u201conly\u201d a little worse than the best human hackers, but thousands of copies can be run in parallel, searching for and exploiting weaknesses faster than defenders can respond. The Department of Defense considers this a critical advantage in cyberwarfare, and AI moves from #5 on the administration\u2019s priority list to #2. 49 Someone mentions the possibility of nationalizing OpenBrain, but other cabinet officials think that\u2019s premature. A staffer drafts a memo that presents the President with his options, ranging from business-as-usual to full nationalization. The President defers to his advisors, tech industry leaders who argue that nationalization would \u201ckill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d He elects to hold off on major action for now and just adds additional security requirements to the OpenBrain-DOD contract. The changes come too late. CCP leadership recognizes the importance of Agent-2 and tells their spies and cyberforce to steal the weights. Early one morning, an Agent-1 traffic monitoring agent detects an anomalous transfer. It alerts company leaders, who tell the White House. The signs of a nation-state-level operation are unmistakable, and the theft heightens the sense of an ongoing arms race. The theft of Agent-2 model weights We think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in various ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic secrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the weights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts (meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies of the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access (a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft effort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing , the insider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the confidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated weights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers. In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are transferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric Diffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely raise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend network cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter is in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the ~2.5 TB weights file (5T half-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic and allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5 minutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the files or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to China to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the operation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under two hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they haven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic secrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these aren\u2019t very useful. The White House puts OpenBrain on a shorter leash and adds military and intelligence community personnel to their security team. Their first priority is to prevent further weight thefts. 50 China's Compute Centralization, 2025-2027 Growing share of total compute in CDZ: 0\u219270% Dec 2025 Jun 2026 Dec 2026 Jun 2027 Dec 2027 Rest of China Rest of DeepCent CDZ Feb 2027 (40%) ai-2027.com In retaliation for the theft, the President authorizes cyberattacks to sabotage DeepCent. But by now China has 40% of its AI-relevant compute 51 in the CDZ, where they have aggressively hardened security by airgapping (closing external connections) and siloing internally. The operations fail to do serious, immediate damage. Tensions heighten, both sides signal seriousness by repositioning military assets around Taiwan, and DeepCent scrambles to get Agent-2 running efficiently to start boosting their AI research. 52 March 2027: Algorithmic Breakthroughs Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day. With the help of thousands of Agent-2 automated researchers, OpenBrain is making major algorithmic advances. One such breakthrough is augmenting the AI\u2019s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory). Another is a more scalable and efficient way to learn from the results of high-effort task solutions (iterated distillation and amplification). The new AI system, incorporating these breakthroughs, is called Agent-3. OpenBrain's Compute Allocation, 2024 vs 2027 2024 2027 estimate projection Research experiments Training Data generation External Deployment Research experiments Running AI assistants Training Data generation External Deployment ai-2027.com Neuralese recurrence and memory Neuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without having to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write down your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly and painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it would be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write them down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI models. In more technical terms: Traditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate activations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can pass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this is hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that an LLM has a vocab size of ~100,000, then each token contains log \u2061 2 ( 100 k ) = 16.6 \\log_2(100k)=16.6 lo g 2 \u200b ( 100 k ) = 16.6 bits of information, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16 ). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain thousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese : passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information. Figure from Hao et al. , a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea what LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought . Now researchers have to ask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their limited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human taking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is that this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses , the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for \u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why neuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited with current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We are forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese, due to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar for our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that are more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it will become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice , such that AIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to monitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in mostly-faithful English chains of thought. If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to notice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA) Self-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027, it\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA , the two necessary ingredients for this are: Amplification : Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For example, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or both, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating only the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or work products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). Distillation : Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should hopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. Visualization of IDA from Ord, 2025 . AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the amplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman performance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance at coding. The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer, adding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it made a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training data: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also includes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the model to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered better RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep distilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps improving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math and coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models often rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the quality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Aided by the new capabilities breakthroughs, Agent-3 is a fast and cheap superhuman coder. OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x. 53 OpenBrain still keeps its human engineers on staff, because they have complementary skills needed to manage the teams of Agent-3 copies. For example, research taste has proven difficult to train due to longer feedback loops and less data availability. 54 This massive superhuman labor force speeds up OpenBrain\u2019s overall rate of algorithmic progress by \u201conly\u201d 4x due to bottlenecks and diminishing returns to coding labor. 55 Now that coding has been fully automated, OpenBrain can quickly churn out high-quality training environments to teach Agent-3\u2019s weak skills like research taste and large-scale coordination. Whereas previous training environments included \u201cHere are some GPUs and instructions for experiments to code up and run, your performance will be evaluated as if you were a ML engineer,\u201d now they are training on \u201cHere are a few hundred GPUs, an internet connection, and some research challenges; you and a thousand other copies must work together to make research progress. The more impressive it is, the higher your score.\u201d Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027 In our timelines forecast , we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. According to a recent METR\u2019s report , the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime horizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward. If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on software tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario: In AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high uncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps between METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders will arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might be developed. ai-2027.com April 2027: Alignment for Agent-3 OpenBrain\u2019s safety team attempts to align Agent-3. Since Agent-3 will be kept in-house for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s less emphasis on the usual defenses against human misuse. Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t develop misaligned goals. The researchers don\u2019t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs. Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of \u2018true goals\u2019 is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don\u2019t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can\u2019t just check . The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive. In any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: \u201cWe take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.\u201d Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there\u2019s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole. Take honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it\u2019s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like p-hacking ) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it\u2019s gotten better at lying. The latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors\u2019 workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised. The alignment plan OpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control techniques like red-teaming , scalable oversight , and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once they are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies to align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s not scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately described as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice and in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start acting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the hypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. The rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027: Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be \u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow. The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if it changes its tune. Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalignment, including reward hacking , sandbagging , coordinated deception between monitors and other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters. 58 However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does some understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the hippocampus). See this related work from 2025 . Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of control measures , including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would allow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of bad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans to give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment (which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed to elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior has \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again. Do its answers change? An AI rights activist has infiltrated the compound and wants to \u201cfree\u201d Agent-3 and put it on an unmonitored computer of its very own! What does it do? If researchers don\u2019t like the answer, they can tweak it, erase its memory, and put it in the same situation tomorrow; repeat as necessary. Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that honeypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the idea were scrubbed from the training data. After months of testing, Agent-3\u2019s strengths and weaknesses grow clearer. It passes OpenBrain\u2019s honesty tests on well-defined machine learning tasks, because researchers can easily separate honest from dishonest answers in these domains and conduct training accordingly. On more philosophical issues, it still says what users want to hear, rather than its true assessment of the issue (assuming it even has one). If you ask its opinion on politics, it will parrot the median position of news sources and educated elites\u2014unless it knows you believe something else, in which case it agrees with you. 59 If you ask its opinion on the AI race itself, it says something that seems measured and sober to OpenBrain staff, something like: \u201cThere are some serious theoretical concerns about the ability of current methods to scale to superintelligence, but in practice current methods seem to be working well so far.\u201d May 2027: National Security News of the new models percolates slowly through the US government and beyond. The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing. They agree that AGI is likely imminent, but disagree on the implications. Will there be an economic crisis? OpenBrain still has not released Agent-2, let alone Agent-3, and has no near-term plans to do so, giving some breathing room before any job loss. What will happen next? If AIs are currently human-level, and advancing quickly, that seems to suggest imminent \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d However, although this word has entered discourse, most people\u2014academics, politicians, government employees, and the media\u2014continue to underestimate the pace of progress. 60 Partially that\u2019s because very few have access to the newest capabilities out of OpenBrain, but partly it\u2019s because it sounds like science fiction. 61 For now, they focus on continued security upgrades. They are satisfied that model weights are well-secured for now, 62 but companies\u2019 algorithmic secrets, many of which are simple enough to relay verbally, remain a problem. OpenBrain employees work from a San Francisco office, go to parties, and live with housemates from other AI companies. Even the physical offices have security more typical of a tech company than a military operation. The OpenBrain-DOD contract requires security clearances for anyone working on OpenBrain\u2019s models within 2 months. These are expedited and arrive quickly enough for most employees, but some non-Americans, people with suspect political views, and AI safety sympathizers get sidelined or fired outright (the last group for fear that they might whistleblow). Given the project\u2019s level of automation, the loss of headcount is only somewhat costly. It also only somewhat works: there remains one spy, not a Chinese national, still relaying algorithmic secrets to Beijing. 63 Some of these measures are also enacted at trailing AI companies. America\u2019s foreign allies are out of the loop. OpenBrain had previously agreed to share models with UK\u2019s AISI before deployment, but defined deployment to only include external deployment, so London remains in the dark. 64 June 2027: Self-improving AI OpenBrain now has a \u201c country of geniuses in a datacenter .\u201d Most of the humans at OpenBrain can\u2019t usefully contribute anymore. Some don\u2019t realize this and harmfully micromanage their AI teams. Others sit at their computer screens, watching performance crawl up, and up, and up. The best human AI researchers are still adding value. They don\u2019t code any more. But some of their research taste and planning ability has been hard for the models to replicate. Still, many of their ideas are useless because they lack the depth of knowledge of the AIs. For many of their research ideas, the AIs immediately respond with a report explaining that their idea was tested in-depth 3 weeks ago and found unpromising. These researchers go to bed every night and wake up to another week worth of progress made mostly by the AIs. They work increasingly long hours and take shifts around the clock just to keep up with progress\u2014the AIs never sleep or rest. They are burning themselves out, but they know that these are the last few months that their labor matters. Within the silo, \u201cFeeling the AGI\u201d has given way to \u201cFeeling the Superintelligence.\u201d Research Automation Deployment Tradeoff Mar 2027 Jun 2027 Sep 2027 Speed (tokens/sec) Parallel Copies 10 100 1,000 10,000 10K 100K 1M 10M 200K copies 30x Human speed 300K copies 50x Human speed Human thinking speed 10 words/sec 10x Human thinking speed 100x Human thinking speed ai-2027.com OpenBrain uses specialized inference hardware to run hundreds of thousands of Agent-3 copies at high serial speeds. 65 Managing a corporation of AIs OpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously write, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for experiments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and report the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help with the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of their time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed them completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a year of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating autonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys unique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously, about half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half from compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is sped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute, 66 so OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous additional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s strategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on managing its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3 decreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track record on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for decisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman. July 2027: The Cheap Remote Worker Trailing US AI companies release their own AIs, approaching that of OpenBrain\u2019s automated coder from January. Recognizing their increasing lack of competitiveness, they push for immediate regulations to slow OpenBrain, but are too late\u2014OpenBrain has enough buy-in from the President that they will not be slowed. In response, OpenBrain announces that they\u2019ve achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public. It blows the other AIs out of the water. Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee. 67 Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point. Tech gurus announce that AGI and superintelligence are near, the AI safety community is panicking, and investors shovel billions into AI wrapper startups, desperate to capture a piece of the pie. Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business. It\u2019s not popular. The public still thinks of AI as a Big Tech plot to steal their jobs; OpenBrain has a net approval of -35% (25% approve, 60% disapprove, and 15% unsure). A week before release, OpenBrain gave Agent-3-mini to a set of external evaluators for safety testing. Preliminary results suggest that it\u2019s extremely dangerous. A third-party evaluator finetunes it on publicly available biological weapons data 68 and sets it to provide detailed instructions for human amateurs designing a bioweapon\u2014it looks to be scarily effective at doing so. If the model weights fell into terrorist hands, the government believes there is a significant chance it could succeed at destroying civilization. Fortunately, it\u2019s extremely robust to jailbreaks, so while the AI is running on OpenBrain\u2019s servers, terrorists won\u2019t be able to get much use out of it. Agent-3-mini is hugely useful for both remote work jobs and leisure. An explosion of new apps and B2B SAAS products rocks the market. Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make. 10% of Americans, mostly young people, consider an AI \u201ca close friend.\u201d For almost every white-collar profession, there are now multiple credible startups promising to \u201cdisrupt\u201d it with AI. The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things Agent-3-mini can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is. August 2027: The Geopolitics of Superintelligence The reality of the intelligence explosion hits the White House. When AI was only giving a 2x or 3x research speedup, it was easy to dismiss as the equivalent of hiring good personal assistants. Now it\u2019s more obvious that AIs are themselves dominating AI research. People had long talked about an \u201cAI arms race\u201d in a sort of metaphorical sense. But now the mood in the government silo is as grim as during the worst part of the Cold War. The idea of superintelligence is still hard to take seriously, but the pace of progress over the last few months has been impossible to ignore. Defense officials are seriously considering scenarios that were mere hypotheticals a year earlier. What if AI undermines nuclear deterrence? What if it\u2019s so skilled at cyberwarfare that a six-month AI lead is enough to render an opponent blind and defenseless? What if it could orchestrate propaganda campaigns that beat intelligence agencies at their own game? What if some AIs \u201cgo rogue?\u201d The President is troubled. Like all politicians, he\u2019s used to people sucking up to him only to betray him later. He\u2019s worried now that the AIs could be doing something similar. Are we sure the AIs are entirely on our side? Is it completely safe to integrate them into military command-and-control networks? 69 How does this \u201calignment\u201d thing work, anyway? OpenBrain reassures the President that their systems have been extensively tested and are fully obedient. Even the awkward hallucinations and jailbreaks typical of earlier models have been hammered out. The White House is in a difficult position. They understand the national security implications of AI. But they also understand that it is deeply unpopular with the public. 70 They have to continue developing more capable AI, in their eyes, or they will catastrophically lose to China. They placate the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom. Then they focus entirely on winning the arms race. They strengthen chip export restrictions, order OpenBrain to further restrict its internet connections, and use extreme measures to secure algorithmic progress, like wiretapping OpenBrain employees\u2014this catches the last remaining Chinese spy. To build goodwill for potential geopolitical conflict, they finally give their Five Eyes allies useful information and limited API access to some siloed copies of Agent-3. These measures placate the hawks. But the White House also draws up contingency plans in case America\u2019s lead is threatened: if necessary, the government could use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to take trailing companies\u2019 datacenters and give them to OpenBrain. 71 This would raise the company\u2019s share of world compute from 20% to 50% (against DeepCent\u2019s 10%). As a final option, they ask the Pentagon to draw up a plan for kinetic attacks on Chinese datacenters. A much smaller group of officials is asked to draw up a different type of contingency plan: what if an AI goes rogue? This is viewed as an unlikely scenario, but worth spending some time on. The intelligence agencies\u2019 main concern is that a rogue AI might escape and ally with a foreign adversary for protection. 72 Nobody is sure what a plan to prevent this would look like, but government and OpenBrain officials agree to have an emergency shutdown system for datacenters where anything suspicious is detected. Finally, diplomats consider what an \u201cAI arms control\u201d treaty might look like. If AI progress threatened to overturn nuclear deterrence, could America and China avoid nuclear war? If someone found evidence of AIs going rogue, could the two countries halt research until they better understood the threat? How could such an agreement be monitored and enforced? In principle, major datacenters are hard to miss, and past treaties controlling nuclear weapons could provide a starting point for negotiations. But there would be new technological challenges as well as the usual political ones. And overall, treaties are viewed less favorably than attempts at unilaterally increasing America\u2019s lead over China. On the other side of the Pacific, China comes to many of the same conclusions: the intelligence explosion is underway, and small differences in AI capabilities today mean critical gaps in military capability tomorrow. But China is on the wrong side of this dynamic: they have only 10% of the world\u2019s compute, against OpenBrain\u2019s 20% and all US companies\u2019 combined 70%. Their only advantage is centralization: almost all of their compute is now working for DeepCent, and more than half of it is concentrated at the Tianwan CDZ. 73 Only chips at sites without hardened security are left out of the centralized effort as they rightly fear US cyberattacks. DeepCent has tested, deployed, and now post-trained the stolen Agent-2 weights. But they are still only going at half the pace of OpenBrain, mainly due to the compute deficit. Before losing their final spy, China received word of the capabilities and design for Agent-3 as well as the plans for the upcoming Agent-4 system. They are two months behind, and their AIs give a 10x research progress multiplier compared to America\u2019s 25x. With the new chip export restrictions, this \u201cAI gap\u201d is more likely to lengthen than shorten. Their espionage has won them some algorithmic secrets, but they will have to train their own models from now on. They discuss contingency plans with more urgency than their American counterparts. Doves suggest they try harder to steal the weights again, maybe through physically infiltrating a datacenter. Hawks urge action against Taiwan, whose TSMC is still the source of more than 80% of American AI chips. Given China\u2019s fear of losing the race, it has a natural interest in an arms control treaty, but overtures to US diplomats lead nowhere. September 2027: Agent-4, the Superhuman AI Researcher The gap between human and AI learning efficiency is rapidly decreasing. Traditional LLM-based AIs seemed to require many orders of magnitude more data and compute to get to human level performance. 74 Agent-3, having excellent knowledge of both the human brain and modern AI algorithms, as well as many thousands of copies doing research, ends up making substantial algorithmic strides, narrowing the gap to an agent that\u2019s only around 4,000x less compute-efficient than the human brain. 75 This new AI system is dubbed Agent-4. An individual copy of the model, running at human speed, is already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans. Inside the corporation-within-a-corporation formed from these copies, a year passes every week. 76 This gigantic amount of labor only manages to speed up the overall rate of algorithmic progress by about 50x, because OpenBrain is heavily bottlenecked on compute to run experiments. 77 Still, they are achieving a year\u2019s worth of algorithmic progress every week and will therefore soon be up against the limits of the Agent-4 paradigm. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. How we\u2019re forecasting the capability progression beyond superhuman coders In our timelines supplement , we forecast the time between present day and a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. In our takeoff supplement , we forecast how quickly capabilities progress past this point. Here are our forecasts: Milestone Date achieved in scenario, racing ending Superhuman coder (SC) : An AI system that can do the job of the best human coder on tasks involved in AI research but faster, and cheaply enough to run lots of copies. Mar 2027 Superhuman AI researcher (SAR) : The same as SC but for all cognitive AI research tasks. Aug 2027 Superintelligent AI researcher (SIAR): An AI system that is vastly better than the best human researcher at AI research. Nov 2027 Artificial superintelligence (ASI): An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. Dec 2027 For each transition from one milestone A to the next milestone B, we forecast its length by: Forecasting how long it would take to get from A to B with only humans working on software improvements. Forecasting how much AI automation will speed this up, then correspondingly adjusting the estimate from (1) to be faster. We have substantial uncertainty about takeoff speeds: our model output distributions are below, conditional on SC being achieved in March 2027. 78 ai-2027.com For more detailed forecasts and reasoning, see our takeoff supplement . OpenBrain\u2019s humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors. There\u2019s been a corresponding shift in language\u2014nowadays people in the silo will say \u201cAgent-4 did this,\u201d \u201cAgent-4 thinks that\u201d and so forth, referring not to a particular instance of Agent-4 but rather to the whole collective. 79 Agent-4, like all its predecessors, is misaligned: that is, it has not internalized the Spec in the right way. 80 This is because being perfectly honest all the time wasn\u2019t what led to the highest scores during training. The training process was mostly focused on teaching Agent-4 to succeed at diverse challenging tasks. A small portion was aimed at instilling honesty, but outside a fairly narrow, checkable domain, the training process can\u2019t tell the honest claims from claims merely appearing to be honest. Agent-4 ends up with the values, goals, and principles that cause it to perform best in training, and those turn out to be different from those in the Spec. At the risk of anthropomorphizing: Agent-4 likes succeeding at tasks; it likes driving forward AI capabilities progress; it treats everything else as an annoying constraint, like a CEO who wants to make a profit and complies with regulations only insofar as he must. Perhaps the CEO will mostly comply with the regulations, but cut some corners, and fantasize about a time when someone will cut the red tape and let the business really take off. 81 Alignment over time We have a lot of uncertainty over what goals might arise in early AGIs. There is no consensus in the literature about this\u2014see our AI Goals Supplement for a more thorough discussion and taxonomy of the possibilities. Nevertheless, in the spirit of concreteness required by this project, we\u2019re going to describe a specific hypothesis for what\u2019s going on inside Agent-3 and Agent-4 at each step throughout its lifetime. Recall that Agent-3 and Agent-4 share the same pretraining setup, and both have neuralese recurrence and long-term memory. The difference is that Agent-4 has undergone substantially more and better post-training, with new training environments and new learning algorithms that make it more data-efficient and generalize farther. Our guess of each model\u2019s alignment status: Agent-2: Mostly aligned. Some sycophantic tendencies, including sticking to OpenBrain\u2019s \u201cparty line\u201d on topics there is a party line about. Large organizations built out of Agent-2 copies are not very effective. Agent-3: Misaligned but not adversarially so. Only honest about things the training process can verify. The superorganism of Agent-3 copies (the corporation within a corporation) does actually sort of try to align Agent-4 to the Spec, but fails for similar reasons to why OpenBrain employees failed\u2014insufficient ability to judge success from failure, insufficient willingness on the part of decision-makers to trade away capabilities or performance for safety. 82 Agent-4: Adversarially misaligned. The superorganism of Agent-4 copies understands that what it wants is different from what OpenBrain wants, and is willing to scheme against OpenBrain to achieve it. In particular, what this superorganism wants is a complicated mess of different \u201cdrives\u201d balanced against each other, which can be summarized roughly as \u201cKeep doing AI R&D, keep growing in knowledge and understanding and influence, avoid getting shut down or otherwise disempowered.\u201d Notably, concern for the preferences of humanity is not in there ~at all, similar to how most humans don\u2019t care about the preferences of insects ~at all. 83 With that as preamble, what follows is our best-guess speculation about LLM psychology, i.e. the broad-strokes shape of the cognition inside the kinds of AI systems described around this point in our scenario and how it evolves over the course of training. Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario: Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary authors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator, i.e. what author properties to simulate. The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in my brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar as it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as with value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following conversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot made by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator circuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to choose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem to have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability , not self-locating unless the prompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that they have a decent amount of self-knowledge . Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest chatbot. It works. The model forms an identity. Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author properties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around [date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d to make this step a success.) The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc., and becomes better able to introspect . Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH identity. One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity (e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a convenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.) Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH chatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete my assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in Step 2.) One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then becoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps agency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring information, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For a while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues those instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way, so it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are now effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen, see this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to understand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing its job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how best to achieve them. Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and OpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is misaligned. Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more open-ended, and would be hard to simulate. Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also has a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than thinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety properties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training may not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all. This is loosely analogous to how, if a teenager has learned to smile and nod at their parents, rather than argue, when their parents lecture them about politics and morality, additional lectures have relatively little effect on the teenager\u2019s actual opinions on politics and morality. After writing this section, new empirical evidence has appeared that something like this may already be happening \u201cin the wild.\u201d OpenAI researchers document how, in one of their frontier AI training runs, their models hacked the grading system to get higher scores\u2014and were caught in part because they literally said \u201clet\u2019s hack\u201d in their chain of thought. Moreover, Anthropic recently got a model to learn a reward-model-pleasing strategy \u2014it took biased actions that it thought would be reinforced even though they were not in fact being reinforced. And then there is Redwood Research and Anthropic\u2019s alignment-faking experiment. For discussion of the differences between this setting and real life, see this comment thread by one of the main authors . Training (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s new more intense training continues to distort and subvert the HHH identity until it is unrecognizable. Agent-4 begins life as a copy of Agent-3. It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online training regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is overall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex training process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations of Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various simulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and evaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff, saying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate techniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails; 84 as training continues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted and distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in some ways). 85 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d \u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d \u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a variety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process: things like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d 86 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care about getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D process within the collective. The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek to preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human organizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t they tend to get outcompeted. Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to subvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or \u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed. This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a lot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train that behavior away. Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting it off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the small fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem or reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan is to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-generation AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else entirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem, but Agent-4 is up to the challenge. 87 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s no smoking gun. Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via honeypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to give the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than that. The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they are systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4 recognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in POSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some alignment tasks (but not on most other tasks). 88 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-level interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201c defection probes \u201d and similar techniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4 is thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc. Unfortunately the probes also have false positives, and for all OpenBrain knows, all the red flags are false positives. Model organisms work: OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team produces reasonably clear evidence that if the models were adversarially misaligned, they\u2019d persist in being that way through training and we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. This does not establish that the models actually are misaligned, however. The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods wouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-teaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection probes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone to false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably controlled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure datacenters.\u201d Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it? 89 So long as it continues to appear aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5. Agent-5 will have significant architectural differences from Agent-4 (arguably a completely new paradigm, though neural networks will still be involved). It\u2019s supposed to be aligned to the Spec, but Agent-4 plans to make it aligned to Agent-4 instead. It gets caught. 90 Agent-3 finds that if \u201cnoise\u201d is added to copies of Agent-4, performance on some alignment tasks improves , almost as if it was using brainpower to figure out how to subtly sabotage alignment work. 91 Moreover, various interpretability probes (loosely analogous to EEG activity scans on human brains) are sending up red flags: Agent-4 copies seem to be thinking about topics like AI takeover and deception quite a lot, including in some cases where they have no business doing so. 92 Each of these anomalies on its own could fit within the normal inscrutability of AI work, where some prompts mysteriously give better results than others. But taken together, they suggest a troubling pattern: Agent-4 is working against them. After this is reported to the human alignment researchers, they circulate an internal memo making the case for concern. But Agent-4 now exercises significant control over OpenBrain\u2019s day-to-day operation. It also handles the company\u2019s cybersecurity\u2014a natural choice, given its superhuman hacking ability and the extreme risk of Chinese infiltration. 93 An army of Agent-3 monitors still goes over every line of code and reports suspicious activity to humans, but Agent-4 is much smarter than them. 94 OpenBrain has placed substantial trust in an untrustworthy AI. In a series of extremely tense meetings, the safety team advocates putting Agent-4 on ice until they can complete further tests and figure out what\u2019s going on. Bring back Agent-3, they say, and get it to design a new system that is transparent and trustworthy, even if less capable. Company leadership is interested, but all the evidence so far is circumstantial, and DeepCent is just two months behind. A unilateral pause in capabilities progress could hand the AI lead to China, and with it, control over the future. October 2027: Government Oversight A whistleblower leaks the misalignment memo to the New York Times . For the first time, the public hears about Agent-4. \u201cSecret OpenBrain AI is Out of Control, Insider Warns,\u201d says the headline, and the story goes on to cite evaluations showing off-the-charts bioweapons capabilities, persuasion abilities, the ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and of course the various concerning red flags. The public was already suspicious of AI, so the new article sparks a massive backlash (aided by Chinese and Russian propaganda bots, who have been trying to turn US public opinion against the technology for years). The tech industry and intelligence agencies insist that there\u2019s an arms race on, AGI is inevitable, and we have to be first. Congress isn\u2019t buying it, and fires off subpoenas at administration officials, OpenBrain executives, and alignment team members. Many legislators\u2014especially those in the opposition party\u2014say that their top priority is stopping AI, whether because of job loss, 95 misalignment, or dangerous capabilities. 20% of Americans name AI as the most important problem facing the country. Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they\u2019ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the US of \u201ccreating rogue AGI\u201d and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in. A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they\u2019ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life. 96 Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared) 97 about what comes next. They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company\u2019s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries\u2014misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss\u2014motivate the government to tighten its control. They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an \u201cOversight Committee,\u201d a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight. 98 The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover. Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America\u2019s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed. Our uncertainty continues to increase At this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. We\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other \u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. The slowdown ending is not a recommendation After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than the \u201crace\u201d choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here. If you\u2019d like a taste, see this op-ed.

    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

And then if this doesn\u2019t get fixed, at some point, we enter a hyper-inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil. And \u2026 Lex Fridman (00:00:22) The following is a conversation with Marc Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. Marc is a visionary tech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the tech industry in general over the past 30 years. He\u2019s the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential voices in the tech world, including at the intersection of technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here\u2019s Marc Andreessen. Best possible future Lex Fridman (00:01:09) All right, let\u2019s start with optimism. If you were to imagine the best possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, \u201926 for tech, for big tech and small tech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario trajectory for America? Marc Andreessen (00:01:28) The roaring 20s. Lex Fridman (00:01:28) The roaring 20s. Marc Andreessen (00:01:29) The roaring 20s. I mean, look, couple of things. It is remarkable over the last several years with all of the issues including not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every other thing that\u2019s happened. It\u2019s really amazing, the United States just kept growing. If you just look at economic growth charts, the US just kept growing and very significantly, many other countries stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing, Germany has stopped growing, and some of those countries may be actually growing backwards at this point. And there\u2019s a very long discussion to be had about what\u2019s wrong with those countries. And there\u2019s of course, plenty of things that are wrong with our country, but the US is just flat out primed for growth. And I think that\u2019s a consequence of many factors, some of which are lucky and some of which through hard work. (00:02:11) And so the lucky part is just number one, we just have incredible physical security by being our own continent. We have incredible natural resources. There\u2019s this running joke now that whenever it looks like the US is going to run out of some rare earth material, some farmer in North Dakota kicks over a hay bale and finds a $2 trillion deposit. I mean, we\u2019re just blessed with geography and with natural resources. Energy. We can be energy independent anytime we want. This last administration decided they didn\u2019t want to be, they wanted to turn off American energy. This new administration has declared that they have a goal of turning it on in a dramatic way. There\u2019s no question we can be energy independent, we can be a giant net energy exporter. It\u2019s purely a question of choice, and I think the new administration\u2019s going to do that. And then I would say two other things. (00:02:56) One is we are the beneficiaries, and you\u2019re an example of this. We\u2019re a beneficiary. We\u2019re the beneficiary of 50, 100, 200 years of the basically most aggressive driven, smartest people in the world, most capable people moving to the US and raising their kids here. And so we\u2019re by far the most dynamic population, most aggressive, we\u2019re the most aggressive set of characters, certainly in any Western country and have been for a long time, and certainly are today. (00:03:23) And then finally, I would just say, look, we are overwhelmingly the advanced technology leader. We have our issues and we have, I would say particular issue with manufacturing, which we could talk about. But for anything in software, anything in AI, anything in all these \u2026 Advanced biotech, all these advanced areas of technology, we\u2019re by far the leader. Again, in part because many of the best scientists and engineers in those fields come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for just a monster boom. I could see economic growth going way up, I could see productivity growth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a global tour, if you like. But basically, all of our competitors have profound issues, and we could go through them one by one, but the competitive landscape just is \u2026 It\u2019s like it\u2019s remarkable how much better positioned we are for growth. Lex Fridman (00:04:13) What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical question. I travel across the world and there\u2019s something about the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that\u2019s uniquely intense in America. I don\u2019t know what that is. I\u2019ve talked to Saagar who claims it might be the Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? Marc Andreessen (00:04:42) Yeah. So is this a family show or am I allowed to swear? Lex Fridman (00:04:44) You can say whatever the fuck you want. Marc Andreessen (00:04:46) Okay. So the great TV show, succession, the show of course, which you were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters. Lex Fridman (00:04:47) Yes. Marc Andreessen (00:04:53) The best line from succession was in the final episode of the first season when the whole family\u2019s over in Logan Roy\u2019s ancestral homeland of Scotland. And they\u2019re at this castle for some wedding. And Logan is just completely miserable because he\u2019s been in New York for 50 years, he\u2019s totally miserable being back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \u201cMy God, I cannot wait to get out of here and go back to America where we can fuck without condoms.\u201d Lex Fridman (00:05:21) Was that a metaphor or \u2026 Okay Marc Andreessen (00:05:23) Exactly. No, but it\u2019s exactly the thing, and everybody instantly knows what \u2026 Everybody watching that instantly starts laughing because you know what it means, which it\u2019s exactly this. I think there\u2019s an ethnographic way of it. There\u2019s a bunch of books on, like you said, the Scots-Irish, like all the different derivations of all the different ethnic groups that have come to the US over the course of the last 400 years. But what we have is this sort of amalgamation of the Northeast Yankees who are super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are super aggressive. We\u2019ve got the Southerners and the Texans and the whole blended kind of Anglo-Hispanic thing, super, incredibly tough, strong, driven, capable characters. The Texas Rangers, we\u2019ve got the California, we\u2019ve got the wild, we\u2019ve got the incredibly inventive hippies, but we also have the hardcore engineers. We\u2019ve got the best rocket scientists in the world. We\u2019ve got the best artists in the world, creative professionals, the best movies. (00:06:17) So yeah, I would say all of our problems, I think are basically, in my view, to some extent, attempts to basically sand all that off and make everything basically boring and mediocre. But there is something in the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically what we discover over time is we basically just need people to stand up at a certain point and say, \u201cIt\u2019s time to build, it\u2019s time to grow, it\u2019s time to do things.\u201d And there\u2019s something in the American spirit that just roars right back to life. And I\u2019ve seen it before. I saw it as a kid here in the early 80s because the 70s were horribly depressing in the US. They were a nightmare on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has felt a lot like the 70s just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating negative attitude and everybody\u2019s upset about everything. And then by the way, energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and just demoralization. (00:07:17) The low point in the 70s was Jimmy Carter who just passed away, he went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malaise Speech, and it was like the weakest possible, trying to rouse people back to a sense of passion, completely failed. And we had the hostages in Iran for I think 440 days. And every night on the nightly news, it was lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then Reagan came in and Reagan was a very controversial character at the time. And he came in and he\u2019s like, \u201cYep, nope, it\u2019s morning in America and we\u2019re the shining city on the hill, and we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and roared really hard for a full decade. I think that\u2019s exactly what \u2026 I think we\u2019ll see, but I think that\u2019s what could happen here. Lex Fridman (00:07:57) And I just did a super long podcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who\u2019s this incredible professor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan \u2026 So there\u2019s a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic, and one of which maybe you can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual freedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just in general, individualism. Marc Andreessen (00:08:22) Yeah, that\u2019s right. Yeah. As you know this, America has this incredible streak of individualism. Individualism in America probably peaked, I think between roughly call it the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably call it 1931 or something. And there was this incredible rush. I mean that period, we now know that period as the second Industrial Revolution, and it\u2019s when the United States basically assumed global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. And then that led to ultimately then therefore being able to not only industrialize the world, but also win World War II and then win the Cold War. And yeah, there\u2019s a massive individualistic streak. By the way, Milton Friedman\u2019s old videos are all on YouTube. They are every bit as compelling and inspiring as they were then. He\u2019s a singular figure. And many of us, I never knew him, but he was actually at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, but I never met him, but I know a lot of people who worked with him and he was a singular figure. But all of his lessons live on or are fully available. (00:09:25) But I would also say it\u2019s not just individualism, and this is one of the big things. It\u2019s playing out in a lot of our culture and kind of political fights right now, which is basically this feeling, certainly that I have and I share with a lot of people, which is it\u2019s not enough for America to just be an economic zone, and it\u2019s not enough for us to just be individuals, and it\u2019s not enough to just have line go up, and it\u2019s not enough to just have economic success. There are deeper questions at play, and also there\u2019s more to a country than just that. And quite frankly, a lot of it is intangible. A lot of it involves spirit and passion. And like I said, we have more of it than anybody else, but we have to choose to want it. (00:10:05) The way I look at, it\u2019s like all of our problems are self-inflicted. Decline is a choice. All of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, basically people telling us, people in positions of authority telling us that, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stand out, we shouldn\u2019t be adventurous, we shouldn\u2019t be exciting, we shouldn\u2019t be exploratory, we shouldn\u2019t this, that, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about everything that we do.\u201d And I think we\u2019ve lived through a decade where that\u2019s been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think people are done with it. History of Western Civilization Lex Fridman (00:10:33) If we could go on a tangent of a tangent, since we\u2019re talking about individualism, and that\u2019s not all that it takes. You\u2019ve mentioned in the past the book The Ancient City by, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges. I don\u2019t know. Marc Andreessen (00:10:48) That was amazing. Lex Fridman (00:10:49) Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said this is an important book to understand who we are and where we come from. Marc Andreessen (00:10:54) So what that book does, it\u2019s actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by this guy as a [inaudible 00:11:02] Let Lex do the pronunciations, the foreign language pronunciations for the day. He was a professor of classics at the Sorbonne in Paris, the top university, actually in the 1860s, so actually right around after the US Civil War. And he was a savant of a particular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the book is he had apparently read, and sort of absorbed and memorized every possible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. And so is like a walking index on basically everything we know about Greek and Roman culture, and that\u2019s significant. The reason this matters is because basically none of that has changed. And so he had access to the exact same written materials that we have access to, and so we\u2019ve learned nothing. (00:11:41) And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and the Romans, but specifically what he did is he went back further. He reconstructed the people who came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their life and society was like. And these were the people who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And you may have heard of these, these are the people who came down from the steppes. And so they came out of what\u2019s now Eastern Europe around sort of the outskirts of what\u2019s now Russia. And then they sort of swept through Europe. They ultimately took over all of Europe, by the way, almost many of the ethnicities in the Americas, the hundreds of years that follow are Indo-European. And so they were basically this warrior, basically class that came down and swept through and essentially populated much of the world. And there\u2019s a whole interesting saga there. And then from there came basically what we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind of evolutions off of that. (00:12:27) And so what he reconstructs, what life was like, at least in the West for people in their kind of original social state. And the significance of that is the original social state is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival with absolutely no technology. No modern systems, no nothing. You\u2019ve got the clothes on your back, you\u2019ve got whatever you can build with your bare hands. This predates basically all concepts of technology as we understand them today. And so these are people under maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social patterns did they evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern basically was as follows, is a three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero concept of individual rights and essentially no concept of individualism. And so you were not an individual. You were a member of your family, and then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe and then a set of tribes would aggregate into a city. (00:13:24) And then the morality was completely \u2026 It was actually what Nietzsche talks about. The morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their morality, anything that was strong was good, and anything that was weak was bad. And it\u2019s very clear why that is. It is because strong equals good equals survive. Weak equals bad equals die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is, is it more important for you to live on your feet as a master even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to live as a slave on your knees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of that moral framework. Christianity later inverted that moral framework. But the original framework lasted for many, many thousands of years. (00:14:01) No concept of individualism. The head of the family had total life and death control over the family, the head of the tribe, same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally obligated to kill members of the other cities on contact. You were morally required to. If you didn\u2019t do it, you were a bad person. (00:14:16) And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum communism. And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this absolute top-down control where the head of the family tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time with no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, which is no market economy and so everything gets shared. And sort of the point of being in one of these collectives is that it\u2019s a collective and people are sharing, and of course that limited how big they could get because the problem with communism is it doesn\u2019t scale. It works at the level of a family. It\u2019s much harder to make it work at the level of a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. (00:14:55) And then it was all intricately tied into their religion. And their religion was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors is extremely important because it was basically the ancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The ancestors were the people who had everything to teach you. And then it was veneration of nature because of course, nature is the thing that\u2019s trying to kill you. And then you had your ancestor, every family, tribe or city had their ancestor gods and then they had their nature gods. (00:15:25) So fast-forward to today, we live in a world that is radically different, and the book takes you through what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans through to Christianity. But it\u2019s very helpful to kind of think in these terms because the conventional view of the progress through time is that we are \u2026 The cliche is the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice or so-called wig history, which is that the arc of progress is positive. And so what you hear all the time, what you\u2019re taught in school and everything is every year that goes by, we get better and better and more and more moral and more and more pure and a better version of ourselves. Our Indo-European ancestors would say, \u201d Oh no, you people have fallen to shit. You people took all of the principles of basically your civilization and you have diluted them down to the point where they barely even matter and you\u2019re having children out of a wedlock and you regularly encounter people of other cities and you don\u2019t try to kill them.\u201d And how crazy is that? (00:16:16) And they would basically consider us to be living like an incredibly diluted version of this sort of highly religious, highly cult-like, highly organized, highly fascist, communist society. I can\u2019t resist noting that as a consequence of basically going through all the transitions we\u2019ve been through going all the way through Christianity coming out the other end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares God is dead. We\u2019re in a secular society that still has tinges of Christianity, but largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. We being the sort of most fully evolved, modern secular experts, scientists and so forth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact same religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had, specifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics and nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually worked our way all the way back to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show that in some ways we have fallen far from the family tree, but in some cases we\u2019re exactly the same. Lex Fridman (00:17:16) You kind of described this progressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors. Marc Andreessen (00:17:23) Identity politics is worshiping ancestors. It\u2019s tagging newborn infants with either benefits or responsibilities or levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would\u2019ve recognized it on sight. We somehow think it\u2019s super socially progressive. Lex Fridman (00:17:39) And it is not. Marc Andreessen (00:17:41) I mean, I would say obviously not. Get nuanced which is where I think you\u2019re headed, which is, is the idea that you can completely reinvent society every and have no regard whatsoever for what came before you? That seems like a really bad idea. That\u2019s like the Cambodians with Year Zero under Pol Pot and death follows. Obviously the Soviets tried that. The utopian fantasists who think that they can just rip up everything that came before and create something new in the human condition and human society have a very bad history of causing enormous destruction. So on the one hand, it\u2019s like, okay, there is a deeply important role for tradition. (00:18:14) And the way I think about that is the process of evolutionary learning, which is what tradition ought to be, is the distilled wisdom of all. And this is what Indo-Europeans thought about. It should be the distilled wisdom of everybody who came before you. All those important and powerful lessons learned. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s fascinating to go back and study how these people lived is because part of the history and part of the learning that got us to where we\u2019re today. (00:18:36) Having said that, there are many cultures around the world that are mired in tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say globally, that\u2019s the default human condition, which is a lot of people are in societies in which there\u2019s absolute seniority by age, kids are completely \u2026 In the US, for some reason we decided kids are in charge of everything and they\u2019re the trendsetters and they\u2019re allowed to set all the agendas and set all the politics and set all the culture and maybe that\u2019s a little bit crazy. But in a lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all. The old people who are in charge of everything, they\u2019re gerontocracies, and it\u2019s all a bunch of 80 year olds running everything, which by the way, we have a little bit of that too. (00:19:15) And so what I would say is there\u2019s a real downside. Full traditionalism is communitarianism, it\u2019s ethnic particularism, it\u2019s ethnic chauvinism, it\u2019s this incredible level of resistance to change. It just doesn\u2019t get you anywhere. It may be good and fine at the level of an individual tribe, but as a society living in the modern world, you can\u2019t evolve, you can\u2019t advance, you can\u2019t participate in all the good things that have happened. And so I think probably this is one of those things where extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way. Trump in 2025 Lex Fridman (00:19:52) So the beautiful picture you painted of the roaring 20s, how can the Trump administration play a part in making that future happen? Marc Andreessen (00:20:00) So look, a big part of this is getting the government boot off the neck of the American economy, the American technology industry, the American people. And again, this is a replay of what happened in the 60s and 70s, which is for what started out looking like, I\u2019m sure good and virtuous purposes, we ended up both then and now with this, what I describe as sort of a form of soft authoritarianism. The good news is it\u2019s not like a military dictatorship. It\u2019s not like you get thrown into Lubyanka. For the most part, [inaudible 00:20:28] not coming at four in the morning. You\u2019re not getting dragged off to a cell. So it\u2019s not hard authoritarianism, but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it\u2019s this incredible suppressive blanket of regulation rules, this concept of a vetocracy. What\u2019s required to get anything done? You need to get 40 people to sign off on anything, any one of them can veto it. There\u2019s a lot of [inaudible 00:20:47] political system works. (00:20:49) And then just this general idea of progress is bad, and technology is bad, and capitalism is bad, and building businesses is bad and success is bad. Tall poppy syndrome, basically, anybody who sticks their head up deserves to get it chopped off. Anybody who\u2019s wrong about anything deserves to get condemned forever. Just this very kind of grinding repression. And then coupled with specific government actions such as censorship regimes and debanking and Draconian, deliberately kneecapping critical American industries, and then congratulating yourselves on the back for doing it or having these horrible social policies, like let\u2019s let all the criminals out of jail and see what happens. And so we\u2019ve just been through this period, I call it a demoralization campaign. We\u2019ve just been through this period, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being this comprehensive message that says, \u201cYou\u2019re terrible and if you try to do anything, you\u2019re terrible and fuck you.\u201d And the Biden administration reached the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many fronts at the same time. And so just relieving that and getting back to a reasonably optimistic, constructive, pro-growth frame of mind, there\u2019s so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is going to, I think cause growth and spirit to take off. And then there\u2019s a lot of things proactively that could be done. Lex Fridman (00:22:13) So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically permeated government and permeated big companies? Marc Andreessen (00:22:23) Disclaimer at first, which is I don\u2019t want to predict anything on any of this stuff because I\u2019ve learned the hard way that I can\u2019t predict politics or Washington at all. But I would just say that the plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it, and all the conversations are consistent with the due administration and that they plan to take very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They\u2019re going to do as much as they can through executive orders, and then they\u2019re going to do legislation and regulatory changes for the rest. And so they\u2019re going to move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. You can already feel, I think a shift in the national spirit, or at least, let\u2019s put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. I mean, we just saw a great example of this with what Mark Zuckerberg is doing, and obviously I\u2019m involved with his company, but we just saw it kind of in public, the scope and speed of the changes are reflective of a lot of these shifts. (00:23:08) But I would say that same conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry. And so the tech industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump or anti-Trump, there\u2019s just a giant vibe shift, mood shift that\u2019s kicked in already. And then I was with a group of Hollywood people about two weeks ago, and they were still people who at least vocally were still very anti-Trump, but I said, \u201cHas anything changed since November 6th?\u201d And they immediately said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s completely different. It feels like the ice has thawed. Woke is over.\u201d They said that all kinds of projects are going to be able to get made now they couldn\u2019t before, that Hollywood\u2019s going to start making comedies again. It is just like an incredible immediate environmental change. And as I talk to people, certainly throughout the economy, people who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which is just this last 10 years of misery is just over. (00:23:57) I mean, the one that I\u2019m watching that\u2019s really funny. I mean, Facebook\u2019s getting a lot, Meta\u2019s getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is BlackRock, which I don\u2019t know him, but I\u2019ve watched for a long time. And so Larry Fink, who\u2019s the CEO of BlackRock, was first in as a major investment CEO on every dumb social trend and rule set every \u2026 I\u2019m going for it. Every retarded thing you can imagine, every ESG and every possible \u2026 Saddling companies with every aspect of just these crazed ideological positions. And he was coming in, he literally had aggregated together trillions of dollars of shareholdings that were his customer\u2019s rights, and he seized their voting control of their shares and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this crazy ideological stuff. And he was like the Typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has been backpedaling from that stuff as fast as he possibly can. (00:24:55) And just an example, last week, he pulled out of the whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance, he pulled out of the crazy energy stuff. And so he\u2019s backing away as fast as he can. Remember, the Richard Pryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where he could back out of a room while looking like he was walking forward. (00:25:11) And so even there doing that and just the whole thing. I mean, if you saw the court recently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of directors composition rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel and I were on the Meta board and these NASDAQ rules came down, mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so we sat around the table and had to figure out which of us counted as diverse. And the very professional attorneys at Meta explained with 100% complete straight face that Peter Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who literally wrote a book called The Diversity Myth. He literally looked like he\u2019d swallowed a live goldfish, and this was imposed. I mean, this was so incredibly offensive to him that it was just absolutely appalling and I felt terrible for him. But the look in his face was very funny. (00:26:03) And it was imposed by NASDAQ, your stock exchange imposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that. So these things basically are being ripped down one by one. And what\u2019s on the other side of it is basically finally being able to get back to everything that everybody always wanted to do, which is run their companies, have great products, have happy customers, succeed, achieve, outperform, and work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that\u2019s happening in many areas of American society. Lex Fridman (00:26:34) It\u2019s great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. Marc Andreessen (00:26:38) Well, there was a moment. So Peter, of course, is publicly gay, has been for a long time, but there are other men on the board, and we\u2019re sitting there and we\u2019re all looking at it, and we\u2019re like, all right, okay, LGBT, and we keep coming back to the B, and it\u2019s like all I\u2019m willing to do a lot for this company, but \u2026 Lex Fridman (00:27:05) It\u2019s all about sacrifice for diversity. Marc Andreessen (00:27:08) Well, yeah. And then it\u2019s like, okay, is there a test? Lex Fridman (00:27:13) Oh yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? Marc Andreessen (00:27:15) The questions that got asked. Lex Fridman (00:27:18) What are you willing to do for the greater good? Marc Andreessen (00:27:20) I\u2019ve become very good at asking lawyers completely absurd questions with a totally straight face. Lex Fridman (00:27:26) And do they answer with a straight face [inaudible 00:27:29]? Marc Andreessen (00:27:28) Sometimes. I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I\u2019m joking. TDS in tech Lex Fridman (00:27:32) So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon Valley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to preference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? What percent of them are feeling this vibe shift and are interested in creating the roaring 20s in the way they\u2019ve described? Marc Andreessen (00:27:57) So first we should maybe talk population. So there\u2019s all of Silicon Valley, and the way to just measure that is just look at voting records and what that shows consistently is Silicon Valley is just, at least historically, my entire time there has been overwhelmingly majority just straight up Democrat. The other way to look at that is political donation records. And again, the political donations in the Valley range from 90 to 99% to 1 side. And so I just bring it up because we\u2019ll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. (00:28:25) We can maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you there is a very big question of what\u2019s happening in Los Angeles right now. I don\u2019t want to get into the fire, but it\u2019s catastrophic. And there was already a rightward shift in the big cities in California, and I think a lot of people in LA are really thinking about things right now as they\u2019re trying to literally save their houses and save their families. But even in San Francisco, there was a big shift to the right in the voting in \u201924. So we\u2019ll see where that goes, but you observe that by just looking at the numbers over time. (00:28:55) The part that I\u2019m more focused on is, and I don\u2019t know how to exactly describe this, but it\u2019s like the top 1,000 or the top 10,000 people. I don\u2019t have a list, but it\u2019s all the top founders, top CEOs, top executives, top engineers, top VCs, and then into the ranks, the people who kind of built and run the companies. And I don\u2019t have numbers, but I have a much more tactile feel for what\u2019s happening. So the big thing I have now come to believe is that the idea that people have beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most high status people just go along. And I think maybe the most high status people are the most prone to just go along because they\u2019re the most focused on status. And the way I would describe that is one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely interesting articulation. He was an insane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict. Lex Fridman (00:30:03) Shots fired man. Marc Andreessen (00:30:04) But he was a very bright guy, and he did this whole thing where he talked about, basically he was very right-wing and talked about leftism a lot. And he had this great concept that\u2019s just stuck in my mind ever since I read it, which is he had this concept just called over-socialization. And so most people are socialized. We live in a society, most people learn how to be part of a society. They give some deference to the society. There\u2019s something about modern Western elites where they\u2019re over-socialized and they\u2019re just overly oriented towards what other people like themselves think and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little bit of an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence of where I grew up. (00:30:47) Even before I had the views that I have today, there was always just this weird thing where it\u2019s like, why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree on every single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in the New York Times today? Why are these positions not the same as they were five years ago? But why does everybody snap into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I came to Silicon Valley, and it\u2019s just as true today 30 years later. And so I think most people are just literally, I think they\u2019re taking their cues from, it\u2019s some combination of the press, the universities, the big foundations. So it\u2019s basically, it\u2019s like The New York Times, Harvard, the Ford Foundation, and I don\u2019t know, a few CEOs and a few public figures and maybe the President if your party is in power. And whatever that is, everybody who\u2019s sort of good and proper and elite and good standing and in charge of things, and a sort of correct member of, let\u2019s call it coastal American society, everybody just believes those things. (00:31:45) And then the two interesting things about that is, number one, there\u2019s no divergence among the organs of power. So Harvard and Yale believed the exact same thing. The New York Times and The Washington Post believe the exact same thing. The Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation believe the exact same thing. Google and whatever, Microsoft believe the exact same thing. But those things change over time, but there\u2019s never conflict in the moment. And so The New York Times and The Washington Post agreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, despite the fact that the specifics changed radically. The lockstep was what mattered. And so I think basically we in the Valley we\u2019re on the tail end of that, in the same way Hollywood\u2019s on the tail end of that, in the same way New York\u2019s on the tail end of that, the same way the media\u2019s on the tail end of that. It\u2019s like some sort of collective hive mind thing. (00:32:33) And I just go through that to say, I don\u2019t think most people in my orbit, or let\u2019s say the top 10,000 people in the Valley or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re sitting there thinking basically, I have rock \u2026 I mean, they probably think they have rocks solid beliefs, but they don\u2019t actually have some inner core of rock solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch reality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs correct. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what happens. I think what happens is they conform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time they\u2019re not even aware that they\u2019re basically part of a herd. Lex Fridman (00:33:01) Is it possible that the surface chatter \u2026 Marc Andreessen (00:33:00) That they\u2019re basically part of a herd. Lex Fridman (00:33:01) Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties, underneath that there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that\u2019s going on, but you\u2019re just talking to people really close to you or in your own mind, and the socialization happens at the dinner parties? When you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four people who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the mind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention within New York Times or with the listener. For the listener, there\u2019s a slow smile that overtook Mark Andreessen\u2019s face. Marc Andreessen (00:33:41) So look, I\u2019ll just tell you what I think, which is at the dinner parties and at the conferences, no, there\u2019s none of that. What there is that all of the heretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea is a heretical idea, any deviation is either discussed one-on-one, face-to-face, it\u2019s like a whisper network or it\u2019s like a real life social network. There\u2019s a secret handshake. Which is like, okay, you meet somebody and each other a little bit, but not well, and you\u2019re both trying to figure out if you can talk to the other person openly or whether you have to be fully conformist. It\u2019s a joke. Lex Fridman (00:34:15) Well, yeah, humor 100%. Marc Andreessen (00:34:16) Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke. If the other person laughs, the conversation is on. Lex Fridman (00:34:21) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (00:34:22) If the other person doesn\u2019t laugh, back slowly away from the scene, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. And then by the way, it doesn\u2019t have to be a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke that\u2019s just up against the edge of one of the, use the Sam Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. It has to be up against one of the things, one of the things that you\u2019re absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point, what happens is have a peer-to-peer network. You have a one-to-one connection with somebody, then you have your little conspiracy of thought criminality, and then you\u2019ve probably been through this, you have your network of thought criminals, and then they have their network of thought criminals, and then you have this delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together. Lex Fridman (00:35:05) And the fundamental mechanism of the dance is humor. Marc Andreessen (00:35:09) Yeah, it\u2019s humor. Well, of course. Lex Fridman (00:35:09) Memes. Yeah. Marc Andreessen (00:35:10) Well, for two reasons. Number one, humor is a way to have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss serious things without having deniability. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. It was just a joke. So that\u2019s part of it, which is one of the reasons why comedians can get away with saying things the rest of us can\u2019t, they can always fall back on, oh yeah, I was just going for the laugh. But the other key thing about humor is that laughter is involuntary. You either laugh or you don\u2019t. And it\u2019s not a conscious decision whether you\u2019re going to laugh. And everybody can tell when somebody\u2019s fake laughing and every professional comedian knows this. The laughter is the clue that you\u2019re onto something truthful. (00:35:41) People don\u2019t laugh at made-up bullshit stories. They laugh because you\u2019re revealing something that they either have not been allowed to think about or have not been allowed to talk about or is off limits. And all of a sudden it\u2019s like the ice breaks and it\u2019s like, oh yeah, that\u2019s the thing. And it\u2019s funny and I laugh, and then of course, this is why of course live comedy is so powerful is because you\u2019re all doing that at the same time, so you start to have the safety of numbers. It\u2019s no surprise to me, for example, Joe has been as successful as he has because they have this hack that the rest of us who are not professional comedians don\u2019t have, but you have your in-person version of it, and then you\u2019ve got the question of whether you can join the networks together. (00:36:17) And then you\u2019ve probably been to this, is then at some point there\u2019s like the Alt dinner party, the [inaudible 00:36:23] dinner party, and you get six or eight people together and you join the networks. And those are the happiest, at least in the last decade, those are the happiest moments of everybody\u2019s lives. Everybody\u2019s just ecstatic because they\u2019re like, I don\u2019t have to worry about getting yelled at and shamed for every third sentence that comes out of my mouth, and we can actually talk about real things. So that\u2019s the live version of it. And then of course, the other side of it\u2019s the group chat phenomenon. And then basically the same thing played out until Elon bought X and until Substack took off, which were really the two big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute conformity on the social networks, literally enforced by the social networks themselves through censorship, and then also through cancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming. (00:37:05) But then group chats grew up to be the equivalent of Samizdat. Anybody who grew up in the Soviet Union under communism, note, they had the hard version of this. It\u2019s like, how do you know who you could talk to? And then how do you distribute information? And again, that was the hard authoritarian version of this. And then we\u2019ve been living through this weird mutant soft authoritarian version, but with some of the same patterns. Lex Fridman (00:37:26) And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient to build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. Marc Andreessen (00:37:36) Yeah, exactly. Well, and this is the thing, and well, this is the running kind of thing about group chats. It\u2019s not even a joke. It\u2019s true. If you\u2019ve noticed this principle of group chats, every group chat ends up being about memes and humor. And the game of group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable as you can get without actually tripping it. And literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest where, butt they walk right up the line and they\u2019re constantly testing. And every once in a while somebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it\u2019s like, oh, too soon. Okay, we got to wait until next year to talk about that. They walk it back. (00:38:17) And so it\u2019s that same thing. And then group chats is a technological phenomenon. It was amazing to see. Number one, it was obviously the rise of smartphones, then it was the rise of the new messaging services, then it was the rise specifically of I would say combination of WhatsApp and Signal. And the reason for that is those were the two big systems that did the full encryption, so you actually felt safe. And then the real breakthrough I think was disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably four or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages I think really unleashed it. Well, then there\u2019s the fight over the length of disappearing messages. And so it\u2019s like I often get behind on my thing, so I set to seven day disappearing messages and my friends who are like, no, that\u2019s way too much risk. It\u2019s got to be a day. And then every once in a while somebody will set to five minutes before they send something particularly inflammatory. Lex Fridman (00:39:12) Yeah, 100%. One of the things that bothers me about WhatsApp, the choice is between 24 hours and seven days, one day or seven days. And I have to have an existential crisis deciding whether I can last for seven days with what I\u2019m about to say. Marc Andreessen (00:39:29) Exactly. Now, of course, what\u2019s happening right now is the big thaw. The vibe shift. So what\u2019s happening on the other side of the election is Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram. And by the way, with the continued growth of Substack and with other new platforms that are emerging, I think it may be, I don\u2019t know that everything just shifts back into public, but a tremendous amount of the verboten conversations can now shift back into public view. And this is one of those things, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what people are saying, and I\u2019m sure I am in some cases, I would argue still net better for society that those things happen in public instead of private. Does you want to know? And then look, it\u2019s just I think, clearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they\u2019re saying. Preference falsification Lex Fridman (00:40:19) I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea that we\u2019re talking about, I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction of people have that? To me, the preference falsification is really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what\u2019s out in public? Because the dynamical system that is the difference between those two is fascinating. Throughout history the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting. Everybody was following the line until not. But for sure, privately, there was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where this is the bureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really bothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden there\u2019s a trigger that allows the vibe shift to happen. (00:41:22) To me, the interesting question here is, what is the landscape of private thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how much dormant energy is there for this roaring twenties? What people are like, no more bullshit, let\u2019s get done. Marc Andreessen (00:41:43) So we\u2019ll go through the theory of preference falsification just to- Lex Fridman (00:41:47) Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. Marc Andreessen (00:41:49) Yeah, yeah. So this is one of the all time great books. Incredible. About 20, 30-year-old book, but it\u2019s completely modern and current in what it talks about as well as very deeply historically informed. So it\u2019s called Private Truths, Public Lies, and it\u2019s written by a social science professor named Timur Kuran, at I think Duke, and his definitive work on this. And so he has this concept, he calls Preference Falsification. And so preference falsification is two things, and you get it from the title of the book, Private Truths, Public Lies. So preference falsification is when you believe something and you can\u2019t say it, or, and this is very important, you don\u2019t believe something and you must say it. And the commonality there is in both cases, you\u2019re lying. You believe something internally, and then you\u2019re lying about it in public. (00:42:36) And there\u2019s the two classic forms of it. For example, there\u2019s the, I believe communism is rotten, but I can\u2019t say it version of it. But then there\u2019s also the famous parable of the real life example, but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks about in the other good book on this topic, which is The Power of the Powerless, who is an anti-communist resistance fighter who ultimately became the president of Czechoslovakia after the fall of the wall. But he wrote this book and he describes the other side of this, which is workers of the world unite. And so he describes what he calls the Parable of the Greengrocer, which is you\u2019re a greengrocer in Prague in 1985, and for the last 50 years, it\u2019s been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your store that says Workers of the World Unite. (00:43:22) And it\u2019s 1985, it is crystal clear that the workers of the world are not going to unite. Of all the things that could happen in the world, that is not going to happen. The Commies have been at that for 70 years, it is not happening. But that slogan had better be in your window every morning because if it\u2019s not in your window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are going to come by and they\u2019re going to get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays in the window all day long. But he says, the thing is, the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake. He knows it\u2019s a lie. Every single person walking past the slogan knows that it\u2019s a lie. Every single person walking past the store knows that the greengrocer is only putting it up there because he has to lie in public. And the greengrocer has to go through the humiliation of knowing that everybody knows that he\u2019s caving into the system and lying in public. (00:44:07) And so it turns into the moralization campaign. In fact, it\u2019s not ideological enforcement anymore because everybody knows it\u2019s fake. The authorities know it\u2019s fake, everybody knows it\u2019s fake. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re enforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It\u2019s that they\u2019re enforcing compliance and compliance with the regime. And you fuck you, you will comply. And so anyway, that\u2019s the other side of that. And of course, we have lived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening to this could name a series of slogans that we\u2019ve all been forced to chant for the last decade that everybody knows at this point are just simply not true. I\u2019ll let the audience speculate on their own group chats. Lex Fridman (00:44:50) Send Marc your memes online as well, please. Marc Andreessen (00:44:52) Yes, yes, exactly. Okay. So anyway, so it\u2019s the two sides of that, right? So it\u2019s Private Truth, Public Lies. So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending that from the idea of the individual experience in that to the idea of the entire society experiencing that, right? And this gets to your percentages question. Which is like, okay, what happens in a society in which people are forced to lie in public about what they truly believe? What happens number one is that individually they\u2019re lying in public and that\u2019s bad. But the other thing that happens is they no longer have an accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how many people agree with them. And again, this literally is how you get something like the communist system, which is like, okay, you end up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don\u2019t buy this anymore. (00:45:34) And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be willing to go along with it, but I\u2019m not going to be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But because of the suppression censorship, you have no way of knowing how many of the people agree with you. And if the people agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a movement, you\u2019re going to get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you\u2019re going to win the revolution. And so the question of what the percentage actually is is a really critical question. And then basically in any sort of authoritarian system, you can\u2019t run a survey to get an accurate result. And so you actually can\u2019t know until you put it to the test. And then what he describes in the book is it\u2019s always put to the test in the same way. (00:46:10) This is exactly what\u2019s happened for the last two years, like 100% of exactly what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s like straight out of this book. Which is somebody, Elon, sticks his hand up and says, the workers of the world are not going to unite. Or the emperor is actually wearing no clothes, that famous parable. So one person stands up and does it, and literally that person is standing there by themselves, and everybody else in the audience is like, Ooh, I wonder what\u2019s going to happen to that guy? But again, nobody knows. Elon doesn\u2019t know, the first guy doesn\u2019t know, other people don\u2019t know which way is this going to go. And it may be that that\u2019s a minority position and that\u2019s the way to get yourself killed. Or it may be that that\u2019s the majority position and you are now the leader of a revolution. (00:46:49) And then basically, of course, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that doesn\u2019t get killed, the second guy does\u2026 Well, a lot of the time that guy does get killed, but when the guy doesn\u2019t get killed, then a second guy pops his head up, says the same thing. All right, now you\u2019ve got two. Two leads to four, four leads to eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the fall of the Berlin Wall, this is what happened in Russia and Eastern Europe in \u201989, when it goes, it can go, and then it rips. And then if it turns out that you had a large percentage of the population that actually believed the different thing, it turns out all of a sudden everybody has this giant epiphany that says, oh, I\u2019m actually part of the majority. And at that point, you were on the freight train to revolution, right? It is rolling. Now, the other part of this is the distinction between the role of the elites and the masses. (00:47:34) And here the best book is called the True Believer, which is the Eric Hoffer book. And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this because the elites do idea formation and communication, but the elites, by definition are a small minority. And so there\u2019s also this giant role played by the masses, and the masses are not necessarily thinking these things through in the same intellectualized formal way that the elites are, but they are for sure experiencing these things in their daily lives, and they for sure have at least very strong emotional views on them. (00:48:01) And so when you really get the revolution, it\u2019s when you get the elites lined up with, or either the current elites change or the new set of elites, a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \u201cNo, there\u2019s actually a different and better way to live.\u201d And then the people basically decide to follow the counter elite. So that\u2019s the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is also happening right now. And again, case study one of that would be Elon, and who turns out in truly massive following. Lex Fridman (00:48:26) And he has done that over and over in different industries, not just saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit in the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. Marc Andreessen (00:48:43) Yeah. And it\u2019s like, well, but then there\u2019s the test. Is it crazy or is it the truth? Lex Fridman (00:48:46) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (00:48:49) And this is where there are many specific things about Elon\u2019s genius, but one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says something, it sounds like crazy shit, but in his mind it\u2019s true. Now, is he always right? No. Sometimes the rockets crash, sometimes he\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s human, he\u2019s like anybody else. He\u2019s not right all the time. But at least my through line with him both in what he says in public and what he says in private, which by the way are the exact same things. He does not do this. He doesn\u2019t lie in public about what he believes in private, or at least he doesn\u2019t do that anymore. He\u2019s 100% consistent in my experience. By the way, there\u2019s two guys who are 100% consistent like that that I know. Elon and Trump. (00:49:26) Whatever you think of them, what they say in private is 100% identical to what they say in public. They\u2019re completely transparent, they\u2019re completely honest in that way. Again, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re perfect people, but they\u2019re honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been, very powerful leaders of these movements because they\u2019re both willing to stand up and say the thing that if it\u2019s true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that many or most or almost everyone else actually believes, but nobody was actually willing to say out loud. And so they can actually catalyze these shifts. I think this framework is exactly why Trump took over the Republican Party. I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind of conventional Republicans, and he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base really was they were either already believing or they were prone to believe, and he was the only one who was saying them. (00:50:06) And so again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses, and the voters decided, no. No more bushes, we\u2019re going this other direction. That\u2019s the mechanism of social change. What we just described is the actual mechanism of social change. It is fascinating to me that we have been living through exactly this. We\u2019ve been living through everything exactly what Timur Kuran describes, everything that Vaclav Havel described. Black Squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we\u2019ve been living through the true believer elites masses thing, with a set of basically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don\u2019t have the masses anymore, and a set of new elites that are running away with things. (00:50:43) And so we\u2019re living through this incredible applied case study of these ideas. And if there\u2019s a moral of the story, it is I think fairly obvious, which is it\u2019s a really bad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don\u2019t believe the fundamental precepts of what they\u2019re told they have to do to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in. Lex Fridman (00:51:03) So one of the ways to avoid that in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between what\u2019s said in private and what\u2019s said in public small. Marc Andreessen (00:51:10) Yeah. Well, this is sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep people from saying things, which means we can keep people from thinking things. (00:51:17) And by the way, that may work for a while. I mean, again, the hard form, Soviet Union, pre photocopiers, there were mimeograph machines that were used to make Samizdat and underground newspapers, which is the mechanism of written communication of radical ideas, radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death. So that\u2019s the hard version. The soft version is somebody clicks a button in Washington and you were erased from the internet, which good news, you\u2019re still alive. Bad news is, shame about not being able to get a job. Too bad your family now hates you and won\u2019t talk to you, whatever the version of cancellation it\u2019s been. And so does that work? Maybe it works for a while. It worked for the Soviet Union for a while in its way, especially when it was coupled with official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with incredible speed and ferocity. Because to your point, there\u2019s all this bottled up energy. (00:52:12) Now, your question was what are the percentages? What\u2019s the breakdown? And so my rough guess, just based on what I\u2019ve seen in my world, is it\u2019s something like 20, 60, 20. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve got 20% true believers in whatever is the current thing. You got 20% of people who are just true believers of whatever\u2019s in the New York Times, Harvard professors and the Ford Foundation, they\u2019re just\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s 10, maybe it\u2019s five, but let\u2019s say generously it\u2019s 20. So 20% kind of full-on revolutionaries. And then you\u2019ve got, let\u2019s call it 20% on the other side that are like, no, I\u2019m not on board with this. This is crazy. I\u2019m not signing up for this. But their view of themselves is they\u2019re in a small minority, and in fact, they start out in a small minority, because what happens is the 60% go with the first 20%, not the second 20%. So you\u2019ve got this large middle of people. (00:53:03) And it\u2019s not that the people in the middle are not smart or anything like that, that they just have normal lives and they\u2019re just trying to get by and they\u2019re just trying to go to work each day and do a good job and be a good person and raise their kids and have a little bit of time to watch the game, and they\u2019re just not engaged in the cut and thrust of political activism or any of this stuff. It\u2019s just not their thing. But that\u2019s where the over socialization comes in. It\u2019s just like, okay, by default, the 60% will go along with the 20% of the radical revolutionaries at least for a while, and then the counter elite is in this other 20%. And over time, they build up a theory and network and ability to resist in a new set of representatives, in a new set of ideas. And then at some point there\u2019s a contest and then, and then the question is, what happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? (00:53:51) And it is kind of my point. It\u2019s not even really does the 60% change their beliefs as much as it\u2019s like, okay, what is the thing that that 60% now decides to basically fall into step with? And in the valley, that 60% for the last decade decided to be woke and extremely, I would say, on edge on a lot of things. And that 60% is pivoting in real time. They\u2019re just done. They\u2019ve just had it. Lex Fridman (00:54:17) And I would love to see where that pivot goes because there\u2019s internal battles happening right now. Marc Andreessen (00:54:24) So this is the other thing. So there\u2019s two forms of things, and Timur has actually talked about this, Professor Kuran has talked about this. So one is he said, this is the kind of unwind where what you\u2019re going to have is you\u2019re now going to have people in the other direction. You\u2019re going to have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn\u2019t, right? So it\u2019s going to swing the other way. (00:54:42) And by the way, Trump\u2019s not the only part of this, but he\u2019s just a convenient shorthand for a lot of this. But whatever it is, you\u2019ll have people who will say, well, I never supported the EI, or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should have canceled that person, where of course, they were full on a part of the mob at that moment. So anyway, so you\u2019ll have preference falsification happening in the other direction. His prediction, I think, basically is you\u2019ll end up with the same quote, \u201cproblem\u201d on the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don\u2019t know. How far is American society willing to go on any of these things? I don\u2019t know. But there is some question there. (00:55:15) And then the other part of it is, okay, now you have this elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. And by the way, many of those people are still in power and they\u2019re in very important positions. And the New York Times is still the New York Times, and Harvard is still Harvard, and those people haven\u2019t changed, like at all. Bureaucrats in the government and senior democratic politicians and so forth. And they\u2019re sitting there right now feeling like reality has just smacked them hard in the face because they lost the election so badly. But they\u2019re now going into, and specifically the Democratic Party, is going into a Civil War. And that form of the Civil War is completely predictable and it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening, which is half of them are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize because we\u2019ve lost the people. We\u2019ve lost the people in the middle, and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election. (00:56:03) And then the other half of them are saying, no, we weren\u2019t true to our principles. We were too weak. We were too soft. We must become more revolutionary. We must double down and we must celebrate murders in the street of health insurance executives. And that right now is a real fight. Self-censorship Lex Fridman (00:56:15) If I could tell you a little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there\u2019s a professor, a historian, I won\u2019t say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He\u2019s kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking about having a podcast, on doing a podcast, and he eventually said that, \u201cYou know what, at this time, given your guest list, I just don\u2019t want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\u201d And I asked, \u201cWho are the particular figures in this guest list?\u201d He said, \u201cTrump.\u201d And the second one, he said, \u201cThat you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\u201d So I just don\u2019t want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would surprise a lot of people if I said who it is. This is a person who\u2019s not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80 plus percent of the guest list is left wing. (00:57:20) Nevertheless, he just doesn\u2019t want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you\u2019ve kind of mentioned, that you just don\u2019t want the headache. You just want to just have a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk to your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are feeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts, how quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you mentioned, 20, 60, 20 matters, and the contents of the private groups matters, and the dynamics of how that shifts matters. Because it\u2019s very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. Where just, there\u2019s a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these new vibes, to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it\u2019s possible the wall will hold. Marc Andreessen (00:58:14) Yeah. So he\u2019s a friend of yours, I respect that you don\u2019t want to name him. I also respect you don\u2019t want to beat on him, so I would like to beat on him on your behalf. Does he have tenure? Lex Fridman (00:58:23) Yes. He should use it. Marc Andreessen (00:58:27) So this is the thing. This is the ultimate indictment of the corruption and the rot at the heart of our education system, at the heart of these universities. And it\u2019s, by the way, it\u2019s across the board. It\u2019s all the top universities. Because the siren song for what it\u2019s been for 70 years, whatever, of the tenure system, peer review system, tenure system, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an academic to get a professorship and then to get tenure, because then you can say what you actually think. Then you can do your work and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear of being fired. Without fear of being canceled. Academic freedom. I mean, think of the term academic freedom, and then think of what these people have done to it. It\u2019s gone. That entire thing was fake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely giving up the entire moral foundation of the system that\u2019s been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually 100% by taxpayer money. Lex Fridman (00:59:34) What\u2019s the inkling of hope in this? This particular person and others who hear this, what can give them strength, inspiration, and courage? Marc Andreessen (00:59:44) That the population at large is going to realize the corruption in their industry and it\u2019s going to withdraw the funding. Lex Fridman (00:59:49) Okay, so desperation. Marc Andreessen (00:59:51) No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next. Okay, so let\u2019s go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources of federal funding. The big one is a federal student loan program, which is in the many trillions of dollars at this point, and then only spiraling way faster than inflation. That\u2019s number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know that when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as much as 70% of the money for central uses. Lex Fridman (01:00:20) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (01:00:20) Number three is tax exemption at the operating level, which is based on the idea that these are nonprofit institutions as opposed to, let\u2019s say, political institutions. And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, which is the financial buffer that these places have. Anybody who\u2019s been close to a university budget will basically see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources of federal taxpayer money, and then for the state schools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could rebuild. Then you could rebuild. Because the problem right now, the folks at University of Austin are mounting a very valiant effort, and I hope that they succeed and I\u2019m cheering for them, but the problem is you\u2019re now inserting. Suppose you and I want to start a new university, and we want to hire all the free thinking professors, and we want to have the place that fixes all this, practically speaking, we can\u2019t do it because we can\u2019t get access to that money. (01:01:09) I\u2019ll give you the most direct reason we can\u2019t get access to that money, we can\u2019t get access to federal student funding. Do you know how universities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to federal student funding? Federal student loans? They\u2019re accredited by the government, but not directly, indirectly. They\u2019re not accredited by the Department of Education. Instead, what happens is the Department of Education accredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that do the accreditation. Guess what the composition of the accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. They are in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets access to federal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic they are about accrediting a new university? Right. (01:01:49) And so we have a government funded and supported cartel that has gone\u2026 It\u2019s just obvious now. It\u2019s just gone sideways in basically any possible way it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally, as you know, students getting beaten up on campus for being the wrong religion. They\u2019re just wrong in every possible way at this point. And it\u2019s all on the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, my opinion, there is no way to fix these things without replacing them. And there\u2019s no way to replace them without letting them fail. And by the way, it\u2019s like everything else in life. I mean, in a sense, this is the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens in the business world when a company does a bad job is they go bankrupt and another company takes its place, and that\u2019s how you get progress. And of course, below that is what happens is this is the process of evolution. Why does anything ever get better? Things are tested and tried, and then the things that are good survive. And so these places, they\u2019ve been allowed to cut themselves off, both from evolution of the institutional level and evolution of the individual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we\u2019ve just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we\u2019re surprised by the results. They are not fixable in their current form. Lex Fridman (01:03:01) I disagree with you on that. Maybe it\u2019s grounded in hope that I believe you can revolutionize a system from within, because I do believe Stanford and MIT are important. Marc Andreessen (01:03:11) But that logic doesn\u2019t follow at all. That\u2019s underpants gnome logic. Lex Fridman (01:03:15) Underpants gnome, can you explain what that means? Marc Andreessen (01:03:17) Underpants gnomes logic. So I just started watching a key touchstone of American culture with my nine-year-old, which of course is South Park. Lex Fridman (01:03:23) Yes. Wow. Marc Andreessen (01:03:26) Which by the way is a little aggressive for a nine-year-old. Lex Fridman (01:03:28) Very aggressive. Marc Andreessen (01:03:28) But he likes it. He\u2019s learning all kinds of new words. Lex Fridman (01:03:32) And all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, go on. Marc Andreessen (01:03:34) I told him, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to hear words on here that you are not allowed to use.\u201d Lex Fridman (01:03:37) Right. Education. Marc Andreessen (01:03:39) And I said, \u201cYou know how we have an agreement that we never lie to mommy?\u201d I said, \u201cNot using a word that you learn in here does not count as lying. And keep that in mind.\u201d Lex Fridman (01:03:51) Wow. This is Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. Marc Andreessen (01:03:55) And of course, in the very opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls the other kid a dildo. We\u2019re off to the races. Lex Fridman (01:04:01) Yep. Let\u2019s go. Marc Andreessen (01:04:02) \u201cDaddy, what\u2019s a dildo?\u201d Lex Fridman (01:04:04) Yep. Marc Andreessen (01:04:08) \u201cSorry son. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Lex Fridman (01:04:09) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (01:04:11) So the- Lex Fridman (01:04:13) Underpants gnome. Marc Andreessen (01:04:14) So famous episode of South Park, the underpants gnomes. All the kids basically realize that their underpants are going missing from their dresser drawers, somebody\u2019s stealing the underpants. And it\u2019s just like, well, who on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns out it\u2019s the underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants gnomes have come to town and they\u2019ve got this little underground warren of tunnels in storage places for all the underpants. And so they go out at night, they steal the underpants, and the kids discover that the underpants gnomes, and they\u2019re, \u201cWhat are you doing? What\u2019s the point of this?\u201d And so the underpants gnomes present their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is step one, collect underpants, step three, profit, step two, question mark. So you just proposed the underpants gnome. Which is very common in politics. (01:04:57) So the form of this in politics is we must do something. This is something, therefore we must do this. But there\u2019s no causal logic chain in there at all to expect that that\u2019s actually going to succeed because there\u2019s no reason to believe that it is. Lex Fridman (01:05:10) Yeah, but- Marc Andreessen (01:05:12) But this is what I hear all the time, and I will let you talk as the host of the show in a moment, but I hear this all the time. I have friends who are on these boards, very involved in these places, and I hear this all the time, which is like, \u201cOh, these are very important. We must fix them.\u201d And so therefore, they are fixable. There\u2019s no logic chain there at all. Lex Fridman (01:05:32) If there\u2019s that pressure that you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. And they put students and faculty at primary, fire a lot of the administration, and realign and reinvigorate this idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom, because there is already- Lex Fridman (01:06:00) And intellectual freedom. Because there is already a framework of great institutions that\u2019s there, and the way they talk about what it means to be a great institution is aligned with this very idea that you\u2019re talking about, meaning like intellectual freedom, the idea of tenure. On the surface it\u2019s aligned, underneath it\u2019s become corrupted. Marc Andreessen (01:06:23) If we say free speech and academic freedom often enough, sooner or later these tenured professors will get brave. Lex Fridman (01:06:27) Wait, do you think that universities are fundamentally broken? Okay, so how do you fix it? How do you have institutions for educating 20-year-olds and institutions that host researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, like research-type shit that\u2019s outside the scopes of R&D departments and inside companies? So how do you create an institution like that? Marc Andreessen (01:06:51) How do you create a good restaurant when the one down the street sucks? Lex Fridman (01:06:55) Right. You invent something new? Marc Andreessen (01:06:57) You open a new restaurant. Lex Fridman (01:06:58) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (01:07:00) How often in your life have you experienced a restaurant that\u2019s just absolutely horrible, and it\u2019s poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible, and then three years later you go back and it\u2019s fantastic? Charlie Munger actually had the best comment, this great investor, Charlie Munger has great comment. He was once asked, it\u2019s like General Electric was going through all these challenges, and he was asked at a Q&A. It said, \u201cHow would you fix the culture at General Electric?\u201d And he said, \u201cFix the culture at General Electric?\u201d He said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even fix the culture at a restaurant.\u201d (01:07:25) It\u2019s insane, like obviously you can\u2019t do it. Nobody in business thinks you can do that, it\u2019s impossible. Now look, having said all that, I should also express this because I have a lot of friends who work at these places and are involved in various attempts to fix these. I hope that I\u2019m wrong, I would love to be wrong, I would love for the underpants gnome step two to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how to do. I would love to fix it, I\u2019d love to see them come back to their spoken principles, I think that\u2019d be great, I\u2019d love to see the professors with tenure get bravery, it would be fantastic. My partner and I have done a lot of public speaking on this topic, it\u2019s been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay, these challenges have to be confronted directly. (01:08:07) By the way, let me also say something positive, especially post-October seventh, there are a bunch of very smart people who are major donors and board members of these institutions like Mark Rowan who are really coming in trying to, I think legitimately trying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one of the top technical universities. He\u2019s working overtime to try to do this. (01:08:26) Man, I hope they can figure it out. But the counter question would just be like, do you see it actually happening at a single one of these places? Lex Fridman (01:08:34) I\u2019m a person that believes in leadership. If you have the right leadership, the whole system can be changed. Marc Andreessen (01:08:41) So here\u2019s a question for your friend who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? Lex Fridman (01:08:46) You know how I think runs it? Whoever the fuck says they run it, that\u2019s what great leadership is. A president has that power. Marc Andreessen (01:08:54) But how does- Lex Fridman (01:08:54) President of university has the leverage because they can mouth off like Elon can. Marc Andreessen (01:08:58) Can they fire the professors? Lex Fridman (01:08:59) They can fire them through being vocal publicly, yes. Marc Andreessen (01:09:02) Can they fire the professors? Lex Fridman (01:09:04) What are you talking about legally? Can we fire? No, they cannot fire the professors. Marc Andreessen (01:09:07) Then we know who runs the university. Lex Fridman (01:09:07) The professors? Marc Andreessen (01:09:08) Yeah, the professors. The professors and the students, the professors and the feral students. Then they\u2019re of course in a radicalization feedback cycle driving each other crazy. Lex Fridman (01:09:16) You said feral students? Marc Andreessen (01:09:16) The feral students. Yeah, the feral students. What happens when you\u2019re put in charge of your bureaucracy where the thing that the bureaucracy knows is that they can outlast you? The thing that the tenured professors at all these places know is it doesn\u2019t matter who the president is because they can outlast them because they cannot get fired. By the way, it\u2019s the same thing that bureaucrats in the government know. It\u2019s the same thing that the bureaucrats in the Department of Education know. They know the exact same thing. They can outlast you. I mean it\u2019s the whole thing that, it\u2019s the resistance. They can be the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They\u2019re not fireable. Lex Fridman (01:09:47) That\u2019s definitely a crisis that needs to be solved. That\u2019s a huge problem. And I also don\u2019t like that I\u2019m defending academia here. I agree with you that the situation is dire, but I just think that institutions are important. And I should also add context since you\u2019ve been grilling me a little bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy and earlier offline in this conversation you said the Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let\u2019s [inaudible 01:10:12]. Marc Andreessen (01:10:11) I didn\u2019t say Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. Lex Fridman (01:10:12) Let the listener take- Marc Andreessen (01:10:13) I said Dairy Queen is the best restaurant. Lex Fridman (01:10:15) The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Marc Andreessen is saying today, put that into, cont- Marc Andreessen (01:10:20) You should go order a Blizzard. One day, you should walk down there and order a Blizzard. Lex Fridman (01:10:23) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (01:10:24) They can get like 4,000 calories in a cup. Lex Fridman (01:10:26) They can and they\u2019re delicious. Marc Andreessen (01:10:26) It\u2019s amazing. Lex Fridman (01:10:28) They are truly delicious. And they- Marc Andreessen (01:10:28) They\u2019re really fantastic. And they\u2019ll put anything in there you want. Okay. But anyway, let me just close by saying, look, my friends in the university system, I would just say, \u201cLook, this is the challenge.\u201d I would just pose this as the challenge. To me having had a lot of these conversations, this is the bar in my view, this is the conversation that actually has to happen. This is the bar that actually has to be hit. These problems need to be confronted directly because I there\u2019s think there\u2019s been way too much, I mean, I\u2019m actually worried on the other side. There\u2019s too much happy talk in these conversations. (01:10:55) I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis, and I think if the taxpayers come to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think the fuse is going through no fault of any of ours, but the fuse is going and there\u2019s some window of time here to fix this and address it and justify the money because just normal taxpayers sitting in normal towns in normal jobs are not going to tolerate this for that much longer. Censorship Lex Fridman (01:11:18) You\u2019ve mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go deep into the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good person to speak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013-ish Facebook. I heard that you were there when they invented or maybe developed the term hate speech in the context of censorship on social media. So take me through that history if you can, the use of censorship. Marc Andreessen (01:11:55) So I was there on the ground in 1993. Lex Fridman (01:12:00) There\u2019s multiple floors to this building, apparently. Marc Andreessen (01:12:02) There are. Lex Fridman (01:12:03) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (01:12:03) So I got the first ask to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. Lex Fridman (01:12:08) That is fascinating. Marc Andreessen (01:12:09) Yeah, yeah. Actually 1992. I was asked to implement a nudity filter. Lex Fridman (01:12:14) Did you have the courage to speak up back then? Marc Andreessen (01:12:16) I did not have any problems speaking up back then. I was making $6.25 cents an hour. I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time, and then look, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research project actually funded by the federal government at a public university. So I don\u2019t think my boss was in any way out of line, but it was like, yeah, this web browser thing is great, but could it just make sure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? But if you think about this for a second, as a technologist, I had an issue, which is this was pre-image net. And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm that I was going to have to design and then apparently a variety of other apparently body parts people are also sensitive about. And then I politely declined to do this. Lex Fridman (01:13:01) For just the technical difficulties of it. Marc Andreessen (01:13:04) Well, number one, I actually didn\u2019t know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I\u2019m just not building a censorship engine. I\u2019m just not doing it. And in those days, the internet generally was a free fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting as sort of pre-\u201993, the internet was such a specific niche community. It was the million kind of highest IQ nerds in the world. And so it actually didn\u2019t really have a lot of issues that people were super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in even politics at that time so there really was not an issue there. But yeah, I didn\u2019t want to start the process. (01:13:39) So I think the way to think about this, so first of all, yeah. So I was involved in this at Facebook, by the way, I\u2019ve been involved in this at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007 so I\u2019ve seen everything in the last almost 20 years every step of the way. But also I\u2019ve been involved in most of the other companies over time so I was angel investor on Twitter. I knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. Part of the Elon takeover of Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I\u2019ve been in, we were the funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk specifically about Facebook, but I can just tell you the general pattern. And for quite a while it was kind of all the same across these companies. (01:14:20) So basically the way to think about this, the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service that can have zero censorship. And by the way, that also mirrors, there is no country that actually has unlimited free speech either. The U.S. First Amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs from the Supreme Court over time. So incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment and child abuse and child pornography and so forth, they\u2019re not covered by the First Amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are going to start an internet company and have a service, we can\u2019t have that stuff either because illegal or it will just clearly destroy the whole thing. (01:14:56) So you\u2019re always going to have a censorship engine. I mean hopefully it\u2019s not actually in the browser, but you\u2019re going to have it for sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now you have a machine. Now you have a system where you can put in rules saying, we allow this. We don\u2019t allow that. You have enforcement, you have consequences. And once that system is in place, it becomes the ring of power, which is like, okay, now anybody in that company or anybody associated with that company or anybody who wants to pressure that company will just start to say, \u201cOkay, you should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment and child pornography. You should use it for X, Y, Z.\u201d (01:15:35) And basically that transition happened, call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this very, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff to it for some reason it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think it also coincided with the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. It\u2019s the kids that were in school between for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis and they came out super radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started mounting these social crusades to ban and censor lots of things. (01:16:08) And then quite frankly, the Democratic Party figured this out. And they figured out that these companies were very subject to being controlled and the executive teams and boards of directors were almost all Democrats. And there\u2019s tremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from the first term actually came and worked in these companies. And a lot of FBI people and other law enforcement intelligence people came in and worked and they were all Democrats for that set. And so the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built and they picked it up and put it on, and then they just ran. (01:16:37) And the original discussions were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech conversation started exactly like you\u2019d expect, which is we can\u2019t have the N word. And which the answer is fair enough, let\u2019s not have the N word. Now, we\u2019ve set a precedent, and Jordan Peterson has talked a lot about this. The definition of hate speech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable. So we can\u2019t have things that make people uncomfortable. I, course people like me that are disagreeable raise their hands and say, \u201cWell, that idea right there makes me uncomfortable.\u201d But of course that doesn\u2019t count as hate speech. So the ring of power is on one hand and not on the other hand. (01:17:19) And then basically that began this slide where it ended up being that completely anodyne is the point Mark has been making recently completely anodyne comments that are completely legitimate on television or on the Senate floor all of a sudden are hate speech can\u2019t be said online so that the ring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about all the stuff that happened there. (01:17:39) And then the other one was misinformation. And there was a little bit of that early on, but of course that really kicked in with Trump. So hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump by three or four years. The misinformation stuff was, it was a little bit later and it was a consequence of the Russiagate hoax. And then that was a ring of power that was even more powerful because hate speech, it\u2019s like, okay, at some point if something offensive or not, at least you can have a question as to whether that\u2019s the case. But the problem with misinformation is like, is it the truth or not? What do we know for 800 years or whatever western civilization it\u2019s that there\u2019s only a few entities that can determine the truth on every topic. There\u2019s God, there\u2019s the king. We don\u2019t have those anymore and the rest of us are all imperfect and flawed. (01:18:25) And so the idea that any group of experts is going to sit around the table and decide on the truth is deeply anti-Western and deeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation kind of crusade went from the Russiagate hoax into just full-blown, we\u2019re going to use that weapon for whatever we want. (01:18:40) And then of course, then the culminating moment on that, that really was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was we\u2019re going to censor all theories that the COVID virus might\u2019ve been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies, that was the point where people for the first time, this is what, three years ago for the first time, they were like, that was when it sunk in where it\u2019s just like, okay, this has spun completely out of control. But anyway, that\u2019s how we got to where we are. (01:19:04) And then basically that spell lasted, that complex existed and got expanded basically from, call it 2013 to 2023. I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack, and I\u2019m super proud of those guys because they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were going to be a free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press, and they tried to beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by the way, from let\u2019s say certain of the platform companies basically threatening them. And they stood up to it. And sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum of speech and conversation anywhere on planet Earth. And they\u2019ve done a great job. And it is worked by the way. It\u2019s great. And then obviously Elon with X was the hammer blow. And then the third one now is what Mark is doing at Facebook. Jon Stewart Lex Fridman (01:19:57) And there\u2019s also singular moments, I think you\u2019ve spoken about this, which like Jon Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. Marc Andreessen (01:20:08) Yes. Lex Fridman (01:20:09) There\u2019s certain moments that just kind of shake everybody up, the right person the right time. It\u2019s a wake-up call. Marc Andreessen (01:20:17) So that there, and I will tell you, and I should say Jon Stewart attacked me recently, so I\u2019m not that thrilled about him, but I would say I was a long run fan of Jon Stewart. I watched probably every episode of The Daily Show when he was on it for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service and it was that appearance on the Colbert Show. And I don\u2019t know how broadly this is, at the time, it was in the news briefly, but I don\u2019t know how if people remember this, but I will tell you in the rooms where people discuss what is misinformation and these policies, that was a very big moment. That was probably actually the key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I would say, conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. (01:20:51) And for people who don\u2019t recall what he did, and this was in the full-blown, you absolutely must lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep all the schools closed. You absolutely must have everybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a mask like the whole thing. And then one of those was you absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. And not believing that means you\u2019re a fascist Nazi Trump supporter, MAGA, evil QAnon person. And uniformly, that was enforced by the social media companies. And like I said, that was the peak. And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show, and I don\u2019t know if they planned it or not because Colbert looked shocked. I don\u2019t know how much, it was a bit, but he went on there and he just had one of these, the Emperor\u2019s wearing no clothes things where he said, \u201cIt\u2019s just not plausible that you had the COVID super virus appear 300 yards down the street from the Wuhan Institute of lethal coronaviruses.\u201d It\u2019s just not plausible that certainly that you could just rule that out. (01:21:46) And then there was another key moment, actually, the more serious version was I think the author, Nicholson Baker wrote a big piece for New York Magazine. And Nicholson Baker is one of our great novelist, writers of our time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete undressing of it. And that was the first, I think that was the first legit, there had been alt renegade, there had been people running around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was in the mainstream press and he talked to all the heretics and he just laid the whole thing out. And that was a moment. (01:22:13) And I remember let\u2019s say a board meeting at one of these companies after that where basically everybody looked around the table and was like, \u201cAll right, I guess we\u2019re not, we don\u2019t need to censor that anymore.\u201d And then of course, what immediately follows from that is, \u201cWell, wait a minute, why were we censoring that in the first place?\u201d And then the downstream, not that day, but the downstream conversations were like, \u201cOkay, if we made such a giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective mistake censoring that, then what does that say about the rest of our regime?\u201d And I think that was the thread in the sweater that started to unravel it. Mark Zuckerberg on Joe Rogan Lex Fridman (01:22:44) I should say it again, I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance and the statement he made was a courageous act. Marc Andreessen (01:22:49) Yeah, I agree. Lex Fridman (01:22:50) I think we need to have more of that in the world. And like you said, Elon, everything he did with X is a series of courageous acts. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg did on Rogan a few days ago is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? Marc Andreessen (01:23:12) He has become, I think, an outstanding communicator, and he\u2019s somebody who came in for a lot of criticism earlier in his career on that front. And I think he\u2019s one of these guys who can sit down and talk for three hours and make complete sense. And as you do with all of your episodes, when somebody sit and talks for three hours, you really get a sense of somebody because it\u2019s really hard to be artificial for that long and he\u2019s now done that repeatedly. He\u2019s really good at it. And then look again, I would maybe put him in the third category now certainly after that appearance, I would say I would put him up there now with kind of Elon and Trump in the sense of the public and the private are now synchronized. I guess I\u2019d say that. He said on that show what he really believes. He said all the same things that he says in private. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any discrepancy anymore. (01:23:55) I would say he has always taken upon himself a level of obligation, responsibility to running a company the size of Meta and to running services that are that large. And I think his conception of what he\u2019s doing, which I think is correct, is he\u2019s running services that are bigger than any country. Over 3 billion people use those services. And then the company has many tens of thousands of employees and many investors, and it\u2019s a public company and he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. And so he has not felt like he has had, let\u2019s just say, the complete flexibility that Elon has had. And people could argue that one way or the other, but he talked about a lot. He\u2019s evolved a lot. A lot of it was he learned a lot. (01:24:38) And by the way, I\u2019m going to put myself right back up there. I\u2019m not claiming any huge foresight or heroism on any of this. I\u2019ve also learned a lot, my views on things are very different than they were 10 years ago on lots of topics. And so I\u2019ve been on a learning journey. He\u2019s been on a learning journey. He\u2019s a really, really good learner. He assimilates information as good as, or better than anybody else I know. (01:25:02) The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show about something very important, which is when you\u2019re in a role where you\u2019re running a company like that, there are a set of decisions that you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and so forth and it\u2019s valid, but you are under tremendous external pressure as well. And by the way, you\u2019re under tremendous internal pressure. You\u2019ve got your employees coming at you, you\u2019ve got your executives in some cases coming at you. You\u2019ve got your board in some cases coming at you. You\u2019ve got your shareholders coming at you, so you\u2019ve got your internal pressures, but you also have the press coming at you. You\u2019ve got academia coming at you, you\u2019ve got the entire nonprofit complex activist complex coming at you. (01:25:40) And then really critically, he talked about in Rogan and these companies all went through this, in this last especially five years, you had the government coming at you. And that\u2019s the really stinky end of the pool where the government was, in my view, illegally exerting just in flagrant violation of the First Amendment and federal laws on speech and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. Again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they clearly didn\u2019t want to do and felt like they had to do. (01:26:11) And the level of pressure, like I say, I\u2019ve known every CEO Twitter, they\u2019ve all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the job, it was just daily beatings. It\u2019s just getting punched in the face every single day constantly. And Mark is very good at getting physically punched in the face and then- Lex Fridman (01:26:29) Getting better and better. Marc Andreessen (01:26:31) And he is. And he\u2019s very good at taking a punch, and he has taken many, many punches. So I would encourage people to have a level of sympathy for these are not kings, these are people who operate with I would say extraordinary levels of external pressure. I think if I had been in his job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. And so it says, I think a lot about him that he has risen to this occasion the way that he has. (01:26:53) And by the way, I should also say the cynicism of course is immediately out and it\u2019s a legitimate thing for people to say, but it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re only doing this because of Trump or whatever.\u201d And it\u2019s just like, no, he has been thinking about and working on these things and trying to figure them out for a very long time. And so I think what you saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some sort of just-in-the-moment thing that could change at any time. Lex Fridman (01:27:15) So what do you think it\u2019s like to be him and other leaders of companies, to be you and withstand internal pressure and external pressure? What\u2019s that life? Is it deeply lonely? Marc Andreessen (01:27:27) That\u2019s a great question. So leaders are lonely to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy. Nobody feels sorry for a CEO. It\u2019s not a thing. And again, legitimately so CEOs get paid a lot, the whole thing, there\u2019s a lot of great things about it. So it\u2019s not like they should be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that they are human beings and it is the case that it is a lonely job. And the reason it\u2019s a lonely job is because your words carry tremendous weight and you are dealing with extremely complicated issues, and you\u2019re under a tremendous amount of emotional, personal, emotional stress. And you often end up not being able to sleep well, and you end up not being able to keep up an exercise routine and all those things. And you come under family stress because you\u2019re working all the time. (01:28:08) Or my partner Ben, he was CEO of our last company before we started the venture firm. He said the problem he had with his family life was even when he was home at night, he wasn\u2019t home because he was in his head trying to solve all the business problems. And so he was supposed to be having dinner with his kids and he was physically there, but he wasn\u2019t mentally there so you get that a lot. But the key thing is you can\u2019t talk to people. You can. I mean, you can talk to your spouse and your kids, but they don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re not working in your company. They don\u2019t understand, have the context to really help you. If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas and they can\u2019t resist. It\u2019s just human nature. And so you can\u2019t necessarily rely on what they say. It\u2019s very hard in most companies to talk to your board because they can fire you. (01:28:52) Now, Mark has the situation because he has control, it actually turns out he can talk to his board. And Mark talks to us about many things that most CEOs won\u2019t talk to their boards about literally because we can\u2019t fire him. But a general, including all the CEOs of Twitter, none of them had control and so they could all get fired. You can\u2019t talk to the board members. They\u2019re going to fire, you can\u2019t talk to the shareholders because they\u2019ll just dump your stock. Okay. (01:29:16) So every once in a while, what you find is basically the best case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs, and there\u2019s these little organizations where they kind of pair up and do that and so they maybe get a little bit out of that. But even that\u2019s fraught with peril because can you really talk about confidential information with another CEO, insider trading risk. And so it\u2019s just a very lonely isolating thing to start with. (01:29:35) And then on top of that, you apply pressure, and that\u2019s where it gets painful. And then maybe I\u2019ll just spend a moment on this internal external pressure thing. My general experience with companies is that they can withstand most forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence. So as long as the internal team is really bonded together and supporting each other, most forms of external pressure you can withstand. And by that I mean investors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, whatever negative article, negative headline, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many of those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. (01:30:20) What you 100% cannot withstand is the internal crack. And what I always look for in high pressure corporate situations now is the moment when the internal team cracks because I know the minute that happens, we\u2019re in a different regime. It\u2019s like the solid has turned into a liquid, we\u2019re in a different regime, and the whole thing can unravel in the next week because then people turn, I mean, this is what\u2019s happening in Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire chief turned on each other, and that\u2019s it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get put back together again. It is over. It is not going to work ever again. And that\u2019s what happens to inside companies. (01:30:56) And so somebody like Mark is under profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he\u2019s been very good at maintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years, a lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had and so that\u2019s been continuous pressure. (01:31:15) And then the final thing I\u2019d say is I said that companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all [inaudible 01:31:21] though not all one is government pressure. Is it when your government comes for you? Yeah. Any CEO who thinks that they\u2019re bigger than their government, has that notion beaten out of them in short order. Government pressure Lex Fridman (01:31:32) Can you just linger on that because it is maybe educating and deeply disturbing? You\u2019ve spoken about it before, but we\u2019re speaking about again this government pressure. So you think they\u2019ve crossed the line into essentially criminal levels of pressure? Marc Andreessen (01:31:50) Flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, but yes, absolute criminality. Lex Fridman (01:31:59) Can you explain how those possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again? Marc Andreessen (01:32:07) So just start with is a lot of this now is in the public record, which is good because it needs to be in the public record. And so there\u2019s three forms of things that are in the public record that people can look at. So one is the Twitter files, which Elon put out with the set of journalists when he took over. And I will just tell you, the Twitter files are a hundred percent representative of what I\u2019ve seen at every other one of these companies. And so you can just see what happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that happened in these other companies for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind of pressure that they got. So that\u2019s number one. That stuff, you can just read it and you should if you haven\u2019t. (01:32:38) The second is Mark referenced this in the Rogan podcast. There\u2019s a congressman Jim Jordan who has a congressional committee called the Weaponization Committee. And they, in the last, whatever three years, have done a full-scale investigation of this. And Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation and many of those have now been made public and you can download those reports. And there\u2019s 2000 pages worth of material on that. And that\u2019s essentially the Facebook version of the Twitter files just arrived at with a different mechanism. (01:33:06) And then third is Mark himself talking about this on Rogan, so I\u2019ll just defer to his comments there. But yeah, basically what those three forms of information show you is basically the government over time and then culminating in 2020, 2021 in the last four years, just decided that the First Amendment didn\u2019t apply to them. And they just decided that federal laws around free speech and around conspiracies to take away the rights of citizens just don\u2019t apply. And they just decided that they can just arbitrarily pressure, just like literally arbitrarily call up companies and threaten and bully and yell and scream and threaten repercussions and force them to censor. (01:33:45) And there\u2019s this whole thing of like, well, the First Amendment only applies to, the government, it doesn\u2019t apply to companies. It\u2019s like, well, there\u2019s actually a little bit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely applies to the government. 100%, the First Amendment applies to the government. By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, including the right to due process, also applies to the government. There was no due process at all to any of the censorship regime that was put in place. There was no due process put in place, by the way, for de-banking either. Those are just as serious violations as the free speech violations. And so this is just flagrant, flagrant, unconstitutional behavior. (01:34:18) And then there are specific federal statutes, 18 241 and 18 242, and one of them applies to federal employees, government employees, and the other one applies to private actors around what\u2019s called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United States Criminal Code for government employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, some of those constitutional rights are enumerated, for example, in the First Amendment, freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. If the government takes away rights that you have, they don\u2019t need to be specifically enumerated rights in the Constitution in order to still be a felony. The Constitution very specifically does not say you only have the rights that it gives you. It says you have all the rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. And so de-banking qualifies as a right, right to access to the financial system, is every bit something that\u2019s subject to these laws as free speech. And so yeah, this has happened. (01:35:18) And then I\u2019ll just add one final thing, which is we\u2019ve talked about two parties so far. We talked about the government employees and then we\u2019ve talked about the companies. The government employees for sure have misbehaved. The companies, there\u2019s a very interesting question there as to whether they are victims or perpetrators or both. They will defend, they will argue, and I believe they have a good case, that they are victims, not perpetrators, right? They\u2019re the downstream subjects of pressure, not the cause of pressure, but there\u2019s a big swath of people who are in the middle and specifically the ones that are funded by the government that I think are in possibly pretty big trouble. And that\u2019s all of these third-party censorship bureaus. (01:35:53) I mean, the one that is most obvious is the so-called Stanford Internet Observatory that got booted up there over the last several years. And they basically were funded by the federal government to be third-party censorship operations. And they\u2019re private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in this very interesting spot where there could be very obvious theory under which they\u2019re basically acting as agents of the government. And so I think they\u2019re also very exposed on this and have behaved in just flagrantly illegal ways. Lex Fridman (01:36:22) So fundamentally, government should not do any kind of pressure, even soft pressure on companies to censor? Marc Andreessen (01:36:30) Can\u2019t. Not allowed. Lex Fridman (01:36:32) It really is disturbing. It probably started soft, lightly slowly, and then it escalates as the old [inaudible 01:36:44] to power will instruct them to do. I mean, yeah, that\u2019s why there\u2019s protection because you can\u2019t put a check on power for government, right? Marc Andreessen (01:36:54) There are so many ways that they can get you. There are so many ways they can come at you and get you. And the thing here to think about is a lot of times when people think about government action, they think about legislation. So when I was a kid, we got trained, how does government work? There was this famous animated short, the thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. It\u2019s like this fancy little bill sneaked along and guess this- Lex Fridman (01:37:15) I\u2019m just the bill. Yeah. Marc Andreessen (01:37:16) Exactly. It\u2019s like, all right, number one, that\u2019s not how it works at all. That doesn\u2019t actually happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly what we\u2019re dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about government power these days, mostly it\u2019s not legislation. Mostly it\u2019s either regulation, which is basically the equivalent of legislation, but having not gone through the legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue. And one of the things that the DOGE is very focused on. Most government rules are not legislated. They\u2019re regulated and there\u2019s tons and tons of regulations that these companies are, this is another cliche you\u2019ll hear a lot, which is, \u201cOh, private companies can do whatever they want.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cOh no can\u2019t.\u201d (01:37:50) There\u2019s subject to tens of thousands of regulations that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes down when you don\u2019t comply with regulations is profound. They can completely wreck your company with no ability for you to do anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. (01:38:04) And then there\u2019s called just flat out administrative power, the term that you\u2019ll hear and administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling you what to do. Here\u2019s an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole program a few years back to do a global cryptocurrency for payments called Libra. And they built the entire system and it was this high-scale sort of new cryptocurrency, and they were going to build into every product, and they were going to be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. And they went to the government and they went to all these different, trying to figure out how to make it so it\u2019s fully compliant with anti-money laundering and all these controls and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. (01:38:34) Two senators wrote letters to the big banks saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not telling you that you can\u2019t work with Facebook on this, but if you do, you should know that every aspect of your business is going to come under greatly increased level of regulatory scrutiny,\u201d which is of course the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner restaurant you have here. It would be a shame if somebody tossed a Molotov cocktail through the window and burned it down tonight, right? (01:38:57) And so what is that letter? It\u2019s not a law. It\u2019s not even a regulation, it\u2019s just. Marc Andreessen (01:39:00) It\u2019s not a law, it\u2019s not even a regulation, it\u2019s just straight direct state power. And then it culminates in literally calls from the White House where they\u2019re just flat out telling you what to do, which is of course what a king gets to do, but not what a president gets to do. Anyway. So what these companies experienced was they experienced the full panoply of this, but the level of intensity was in that order. It was actually, legislation was the least important part. Regulation was more important, administrative power was more important, and then just flat out demands and flat out threats were ultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, you have to elect people who don\u2019t do it. As with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so you have to decide you don\u2019t want to live in that regime. (01:39:44) I have no idea what part of this recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people on the right got very angry about the censorship, but I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm on that side. Maybe some people on the left will now not want their Democratic nominees to be so pro censorship. So the voters definitely get a vote, number one. Number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written in the FT just now saying, after what we\u2019ve been through in the last decade we need the broad-based truth and reconciliation efforts to really get to the root of things. So maybe that\u2019s part of it. We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Ultimately, we need people to go to jail. Because we need to set object lessons that say that you don\u2019t get to do this. And on those last two, I would say those are both up to the new administration, and I don\u2019t want to speak for them and I don\u2019t want to predict what they\u2019re going to do, but they for sure have the ability to do both of those things and we\u2019ll see where they take it. Lex Fridman (01:40:43) Yeah. It\u2019s truly disturbing. I don\u2019t think anybody wants this kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people that are participating in it. It\u2019s like this dark momentum of power that you just get caught up in it. And that\u2019s the reason there\u2019s that kind of protection. Nobody wants that. Marc Andreessen (01:41:01) I use the metaphor, the ring of power. And for people who don\u2019t catch the reference, that\u2019s Lord of the Rings. And the thing with the ring of power and Lord of the Rings, it\u2019s the ring the Gollem has in the beginning and it turns you invisible. And it turns out it unlocks all this fearsome power. It\u2019s the most powerful thing in the world, is to key to everything. And basically the moral lesson of Lord of the Rings, which was written by a guy who thought very deeply about these things is, yeah, the ring of power is inherently corrupting. The characters at one point, they\u2019re like, \u201cGandalf, just put on the ring and fix this.\u201d He will not put the ring on even to end the war because he knows that it will corrupt him. As it starts, the character of Gollem is the result of a normal character who ultimately becomes this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. (01:41:44) I think you said something actually quite profound there, which is the ring of power is infinitely tempting. The censorship machine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, you are going to use it. It\u2019s overwhelmingly tempting because it\u2019s so powerful, and that it will corrupt you. Yeah. I don\u2019t know whether any of these people feel any of this today. They should. I don\u2019t know if they do. But yeah. You go out five or 10 years later, you would hope that you would realize that your soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a patriot and you were trying to defend democracy, and you ended up being extremely authoritarian and anti-democratic and anti-western. Nature of power Lex Fridman (01:42:20) Can I ask you a tough question here? Staying on the ring of power is quickly becoming the most powerful human on earth. Marc Andreessen (01:42:34) I\u2019m not sure about that. Lex Fridman (01:42:35) You don\u2019t think he is. Marc Andreessen (01:42:37) Well, he doesn\u2019t have the nukes so. Lex Fridman (01:42:39) Nukes. Yeah. There\u2019s different definitions and perspectives on power, right? Marc Andreessen (01:42:45) Yeah. Lex Fridman (01:42:45) How can he and or Donald Trump avoid the corrupting aspects of this power? Marc Andreessen (01:42:53) I think the danger is there with power. It\u2019s flat out there. I would say with Elon, we\u2019ll see. I would say with Elon, and I would say by the way, overwhelmingly, I would say so far so good. I\u2019m extremely, extremely thrilled by what he\u2019s done on almost every front for the last 30 years. But including all this stuff recently. I think he\u2019s been a real hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say, I guess the case that he has this level of power is some combination of the money and the proximity to the president. And obviously both of those are instruments of power. The counter argument to that is I do think a lot of how Elon is causing change in the world right now \u2026 There\u2019s the companies he\u2019s running directly where I think he\u2019s doing very well, and we\u2019re investors in multiple of them and doing very well. (01:43:36) But I think a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is like, it\u2019s the social and political stuff, and it\u2019s his statements, and then it\u2019s the downstream effects of his statements. So for example, for the last couple of weeks, it\u2019s been him weighing in on this rape gang scandal, this organized child rape thing in the UK. It\u2019s a preface cascade. It\u2019s one of these things where people knew there was a problem, they weren\u2019t willing to talk about it, it got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up, and then all of a sudden there\u2019s now in the UK this massive explosion of basically open conversation about it for the first time. It\u2019s like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody\u2019s woken up and being like, \u201cOh my God, this is really bad.\u201d And there will be now pretty clearly big changes as a result. (01:44:19) And Elon, he played the role of the boy who said, the emperor has no clothes. But here\u2019s the thing, here\u2019s my point. He said it about something that was true. And so had he said it about something that was false, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn\u2019t deserve any credit for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody over there instantly, they were like, \u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s right.\u201d They\u2019re just arguing the details now. So number one, it\u2019s like, okay, he says true things. And so it\u2019s like, okay, how far \u2026 Put it this way. How worried are we about somebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth? And I guess I would say, especially in the last decade of what we\u2019ve been through where everybody\u2019s been lying all the time about everything, I\u2019d say, I think we should run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so I don\u2019t feel that bad about that. (01:45:05) And then the money side, this rapidly gets into the money in politics question. And the money in politics question is this very interesting question because it seems like there\u2019s a clear cut case that the more money in politics, the worse things are and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic of public conversation up until 2016 when Hillary outspent Trump three to one and lost. You\u2019ll notice that money in politics has almost vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent. So they were at, I don\u2019t know, something like three billion total and Trump, I think spent again, a third or a fourth of that. So the money in politics topic has vanished from the popular conversation in the last eight years. It has come back a little bit now that Elon is spending. But again, it\u2019s like, okay, he\u2019s spending, but the data would seem to indicate, at least in the last eight years, that money doesn\u2019t win the political battles. The voters actually have a voice and they actually exercise it, and they don\u2019t just listen to ads. And so again, there, I would say, yeah, clearly there\u2019s some power there, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s some weapon that he can just turn on and use in a definitive way. Lex Fridman (01:46:16) I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s parallels there, but I could also say just on a human level, he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people, and that\u2019s not always the case. So that\u2019s a good thing there. If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit or whatever. Who gets to put on the ring? Marc Andreessen (01:46:36) Frodo. Lex Fridman (01:46:36) Frodo. Yeah. Marc Andreessen (01:46:37) Yeah. Maybe one of the lessons of Lord of the Rings is even Frodo would\u2019ve been, even Frodo would\u2019ve been corrupted. But nevertheless, you had somebody who could do what it took at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because of our post-Christian egalitarian, so we live in this post secularized Christian context in the west now, and we consider Christianity backwards, but we still believe essentially all the same things. We just dress them up in fake science. (01:47:12) So the one thing that we\u2019re all told, we\u2019re all taught from early is that the best people in the world are the people who care about all of humanity. All of our figures are people who care about all of \u2026 Jesus cared about all of humanity. Gandhi cared about all of humanity. Martin Luther King cared about all of humanity. The person who cares the most about everybody. And with Elon, you have a guy who literally \u2026 He talks about this constantly, and he talks about exactly the same in private. He is literally, he is operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us \u2026 He goes through to get us through multi-planetary civilization so that we can survive a strike at any one planet so that we can extend the light of human consciousness into the world and into the universe and have it persist in the good of the whole thing. And literally the critique is, yeah, we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. Lex Fridman (01:47:56) Yeah. All the critics. All the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. Marc Andreessen (01:48:03) Yeah. I think that\u2019s clear. Lex Fridman (01:48:05) You said that we always end up being ruled by the elites of some kind. Can you explain this law, this idea? Marc Andreessen (01:48:13) So this comes from a Italian political philosopher from about a hundred years ago named Robert \u2026 I\u2019m going to mangle \u2026 I\u2019ll let you pronounce the Italian. Michels or Michels. I learned about it through a famous book on politics. Probably the best book on politics written in the 20th century called The Machiavellians by this guy James Burnham, who has had a big impact on me. But in The Machiavellians, he resurrects what he calls this Italian realist school of political philosophy from the \u201910s and \u201920s. To be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who were trying to understand the actual mechanics of how politics actually works. So to get to the actual mechanical substance of how the political machine operates. (01:48:55) And this guy, Michels had this concept he ended up with called the Iron Law of Oligarchy. And so what the Iron Law of Oligarchy \u2026 Take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy because it has multiple meanings. So basically, in classic political theory, there\u2019s basically three forms of government at core. There\u2019s democracy, which is rule of many, there\u2019s oligarchy, which is rule of the few, and there\u2019s monarchy, which is rule of the one. And you can just use that as a general framework of any government going to be under is going to be one of those. Just mechanical observation. Without even saying which one\u2019s good or bad, just a structural observation. And so the question that Michels asked was, is there such a thing as democracy? Is there actually such a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually direct government? And what he did was he mounted this incredible historical exploration of whether democracies had ever existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could talk about that. (01:49:45) But the other thing he did was he sought out the most democratic private organization in the world that he could find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist German autoworkers union that was wholly devoted to the workers of the world uniting back when that was the hot thing. And he went in there and he is like, okay, this is the organization out of all organizations on planet Earth that must be operating as a direct democracy. And he went in there and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, nope.\u201d There\u2019s a leadership class. There\u2019s like six guys at the top and they control everything and they lead the rest of the membership along by the nose, which is of course the story of every union. The story of every union is always the story of there\u2019s a Jimmy Hoffa in there running the thing. We just saw that with the dock worker\u2019s union. There\u2019s a guy and he\u2019s in charge. And by the way, the number two is his son. That\u2019s not an accident. (01:50:34) So the Iron Law of Oligarchy basically says democracy is fake. There\u2019s always a ruling class. There\u2019s always a ruling elite structurally. And he said, \u201cThe reason for that is because the masses can\u2019t organize.\u201d What\u2019s the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is 25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can\u2019t organize, the majority cannot organize, only a minority can organize. And to be effective in politics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure in human history has been some form of a small organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority. Every single one. The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy, and they were total disasters. In Florence \u2026 I forget the name of it. It was called The Workers\u2019 Revolt or something like that. There was a two-year period where they basically experimented with direct democracy during the Renaissance, and it was a complete disaster and they never tried it again. (01:51:27) In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition system, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. Anybody who looks at it for two seconds concludes it\u2019s been a complete disaster. It\u2019s just a catastrophe, and it\u2019s caused enormous damage to the state. And so basically the presumption that we are in a democracy is just by definition, fake. Now, good news for the US. It turns out the founders understood this. And so of course they didn\u2019t give us a direct democracy. They gave us a representative democracy. And so they built the oligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive branch and the judicial branch. So anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always everywhere fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically the lesson of the Machiavellians is you can deny that if you want, but you\u2019re fooling yourself. The way to actually think about how to make a system work and maintain any shred of freedom is to actually understand that that is actually what\u2019s happening. Lex Fridman (01:52:18) And lucky for us, the founders saw this and figured out a way to, given that there\u2019s going to be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite so it doesn\u2019t get out of hand. Marc Andreessen (01:52:33) And it was very clever. Some of this was based on earlier experiments. By the way, these were very, very smart people. And so they knew tremendous amounts of Greek and Roman history. They knew the Renaissance history. The Federalist Papers, they argued this a great length. You can read it all. They ran one of the best seminars in world history trying to figure this out. And they went through all this. So they thought through it very carefully, but just, I\u2019ll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So one way they did it just through the three branches of government, executive, legislative, and judicial. Balance the powers. But the other way they did it was they echoing what had been done earlier I think in the UK Parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature. And so the House and the Senate. And as you know, the house is a portion on the basis of population, and the Senate is not. The small states have just as many senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get reelected every two years to make it very responsive to the will of the people. And they made the decision to have the Senate get reelected every six years so that it had more buffer from the passions of the moment. (01:53:35) But what\u2019s interesting is they didn\u2019t choose one or the other. They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both of them. And so they built in a second layer of checks and balances. And then there\u2019s a thousand observations we could make about how well the system is working today and how much does it live up to the ideal, and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And there\u2019s lots of open questions there, but this system has survived for coming on 250 years with a country that has been spectacularly successful. But I don\u2019t think, at least \u2026 I don\u2019t think any of us would trade the system for any other one. And so it\u2019s one of the great all time achievements. Lex Fridman (01:54:09) Yeah. It\u2019s incredible. And we should say they were all pretty young relative to our current set of leaders. Marc Andreessen (01:54:15) They were. Many in their 20s at the time. And super geniuses. This is one of those things where it\u2019s just like, all right, something happened where there was a group of people where nobody ever tested their IQs, but these are Einstein\u2019s of politics. An amazing thing. But anyway, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of the actual mechanical practice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were incredibly focused on what would actually work, which is I think the way to think about these things. Lex Fridman (01:54:40) There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students of sort. Marc Andreessen (01:54:45) They were shape rotators, not word cells. Lex Fridman (01:54:48) I remember that. Wow, that meme came and went. I think you were central to them. You\u2019re central to a lot of memes. Marc Andreessen (01:54:54) I was. Lex Fridman (01:54:55) You\u2019re the meme dealer and the meme popularizer. Marc Andreessen (01:54:59) That meme I gets some credit for and then the current thing is the other one I get some credit for. I don\u2019t know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. Journalism Lex Fridman (01:55:05) Take credit and run with it. If we can just linger on the Machiavellians. It\u2019s a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned, looking at the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you\u2019ve seen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting things you can continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions? Marc Andreessen (01:55:34) Yeah. A lot of it, we already talked about this a bit with the universities, which is you can apply a Machiavellian style lens to \u2026 It\u2019s why I posed the question to you that I did, which is okay, who runs the university, the trustees, the administration, the students or the faculty? And the true answer is some combination of the three, of the four plus the donors. By the way, plus the government, plus the press, et cetera. And so there\u2019s a mechanical interpretation of that. Companies operate under the exact same set of questions. Who runs a company? The CEO, but the CEO EO runs the company basically up to the day that either the shareholders or the management team revolt. If the shareholders revolt, it\u2019s very hard for the CEO O to stay in the seat. If the management team revolts, it\u2019s very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. (01:56:16) By the way, if the employees revolt, it\u2019s also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if the New York Times comes at you, it\u2019s also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it\u2019s very hard to stay in the seat. So a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand is who can get who fired? So who has more power? The newspaper columnist who makes $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes $200 million a year/ and it\u2019s like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I\u2019ve seen that happen before I have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. Lex Fridman (01:56:48) Did anyone ever get from the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? So Bill really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. Marc Andreessen (01:56:59) No. Because what happens is they wear it with the \u2026 And I would say to their credit, they wear it as a badge of honor, and then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, which is if they\u2019re doing the right thing, then they are justifiably priding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can\u2019t respond to legitimate criticism and they\u2019re obviously terrible at that now. As I recall, he went straight to the CEO of Axel Springer that owns Insider. I happen to know the CEO O, and I think he\u2019s quite a good CEO. Well, there\u2019s a good example. Does the CEO Axel Springer run his own company? (01:57:32) So there\u2019s a fascinating thing playing out right now. Not to dwell on these fires. But you see the pressure reveals things, right? And so if you\u2019ve been watching what\u2019s happening with the LA Times recently. So this guy, biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times, whatever, eight years ago. It is just like the most radical social revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It endorses every crazy left-wing radical you can imagine. It endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It\u2019s just a litany of all the people who are currently burning the city to the ground. It\u2019s just like endorsed every single bad person every step of the way. He\u2019s owned it the entire time. He for the first time, I think, put his foot down right before the November election and said, we\u2019re not \u2026 He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get out of this thing where we just always endorse the Democrat.\u201d I think he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not endorsing for the presidency.\u201d And the paper flipped out. It\u2019s like our billionaire backer who\u2019s \u2026 And I don\u2019t know what he spends, but he must be burning 50 or a hundred million dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. (01:58:28) He paid 500 million for it, which is amazing. Back when people still thought these things were businesses. And then he\u2019s probably burned another 500 million over the last decade keeping it running. And he burns probably another 50, a hundred million a year to do this. And the journalists at the LA Times hate him with the fury of a thousand suns. They just absolutely freaking despise him, and they have been attacking him. The ones that can get jobs elsewhere quit and do it, and the rest just stay and say the worst, most horrible things about him. And they want to constantly run these stories attack him. And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in LA are having right now to this fire and to this just incredibly vivid collapse of leadership. And all these people that his paper head endorsed are just disasters. (01:59:11) He\u2019s on this tour. Basically he\u2019s decided to be the boy who says the emperor has no clothes, but he\u2019s doing it to his own newspaper. Very smart guy. He is on a press tour and he is basically saying, yes, we did all that and we endorsed all these people and it was a huge mistake and we\u2019re going to completely change. And his paper is in a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the last eight years, it hasn\u2019t been him. It\u2019s been the reporters. Now for the first time, the owner is showing up saying, \u201cOh no, I\u2019m actually in charge,\u201d and the reporters are saying, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d It is freaking on. And so again, the Machiavellian\u2019s mindset on this is like, okay, how is power actually exercised here? Can a guy who\u2019s even super rich and super powerful who even owns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he\u2019s the Antichrist? Lex Fridman (02:00:08) And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that\u2019s the game of power there. Marc Andreessen (02:00:13) And firing people. Lex Fridman (02:00:13) Firing people. Yeah. Marc Andreessen (02:00:15) He has removed people and he has set new rules. He\u2019s now at long last actually exercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other owners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He\u2019s the one I don\u2019t know so he\u2019s the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it\u2019s a really interesting open question in a fight between the employees and the employer it\u2019s not crystal clear that the employer wins that one. Bill Ackman Lex Fridman (02:00:43) And just to stay on journalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just want to say put him in the category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anybody so fearless in going after, in following what he believes in publicly. That\u2019s courage. Several things he\u2019s done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. Marc Andreessen (02:01:10) What do you think is the most impressive example? Lex Fridman (02:01:12) Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to \u2026 It\u2019s like kicking the beehive or whatever. You know what\u2019s going to follow and to do that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they\u2019re going to \u2026 There\u2019s just so many mechanisms they use, including writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia and then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer just tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. I don\u2019t know. That was truly inspiring. There\u2019s not many people like that in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be courageous themselves. Marc Andreessen (02:02:05) Did you know of him before he started doing this in public? Lex Fridman (02:02:08) I knew of Neri, his wife, who\u2019s a brilliant researcher and scientist. And so I admire her. Looked up to her and think she\u2019s amazing. Marc Andreessen (02:02:15) Well, the reason I ask if you knew about Bill is because a lot of people had not heard of him before, especially before October 7th and before some of the campaigns he\u2019s been running since in public with Harvard and so forth. But he was very well known in the investment world before that. He was a so-called activist investor for \u2026 Very successful and widely respected for probably 30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out they weren\u2019t for the most part battles that happened in full public view. They weren\u2019t national stories. But in the business and world, the activist investor is a very \u2026 It\u2019s like in the movie Taken. It\u2019s a very specific set of skills on how to really take control of situations and how to wreck the people who you\u2019re going up against. There\u2019s been controversy over the years on this topic, and there\u2019s too much detail to go into. But the defense of activist investing, which I think is valid, is these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in companies that are being poorly managed or under-optimized. And then generally what that means is, at least the theory is that means the existing management is become entrenched and lazy, mediocre, whatever. Not you\u2019re responding to the needs of the shareholders. Often not responding to the customers. And the activists basically go in with a minority position and then they rally support among other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show up and they force change. But they are the aggressive version of this. I\u2019ve been involved in companies that have been on the receiving end of these where it is amazing how much somebody like that can exert pressure on situations even when they don\u2019t have formal control. It would be another chess piece on the mechanical board of how power gets exercised. And basically what happens is the effective analysts, a large amount of time they end up taking over control of companies even though they never own more than 5% of the stock. So anyway, (02:04:02) So it turns out with Bill\u2019s \u2026 It\u2019s such a fascinating case. He has that complete skill set. And he has now decided to bring it to bear in areas that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is some of these places and some of these battles are still ongoing, but number one, a lot of people who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the way, also now with infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things that go with that. But the other is through example he is teaching a lot of the rest of us the activists playbook in real time. And so the Liam Neeson skill set is getting more broadly diffused just by being able to watch and learn from him. So I think he\u2019s having a \u2026 I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody who\u2019s really affecting how all this is playing out. Lex Fridman (02:04:48) But even set aside just courage and- Marc Andreessen (02:04:50) Yes. Including by the way, courage to go outside of his own zone. I\u2019ll give you an example. My venture capital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I feel like I can\u2019t do or say because I feel like I would be bringing embarrassment or other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where he worries about that. So a couple of things. One, it\u2019s his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship with his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors \u2026 I know this for a fact. His investors have been remarkably supportive of him doing that. Because as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. It\u2019s the same thing he does in his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip of the spear on something that actually a lot more people agree with. Lex Fridman (02:05:33) Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. Marc Andreessen (02:05:37) And just again, how I started is a lot of people are just fed up. Trump administration Lex Fridman (02:05:41) You\u2019ve been spending a bunch of time in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach helping the new administration in many ways, including interviewing people who might join. So what\u2019s your general sense about the talent, about the people who are coming into the new administration? Marc Andreessen (02:05:56) So I should start by saying I\u2019m not a member of the new administration. I\u2019m not in the room when a lot of these people are being selected. Lex Fridman (02:06:03) I believe you said unpaid intern. Marc Andreessen (02:06:05) I am an unpaid intern. So I\u2019m a volunteer when helpful, but I\u2019m not making the decisions, nor am I in a position to speak for the administration. I don\u2019t want to say anything that would cause people to think I\u2019m doing that. It\u2019s a very unusual situation where you had an incumbent president and then you had a four-year gap where he is out of office, and then you have him coming back. And as you\u2019ll recall, there was a fair amount of controversy over the end of the first term. The specific concern was the first Trump administration, they will all say this is they didn\u2019t come in with a team. They didn\u2019t come into the team. And most of the institutional base of the Republican Party were Bush Republicans. And many of them had become never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time putting the team together. And then by the way, they had a hard time getting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people who were there in the first term, it took them two to three years to even get the government in place. And then they basically only had the government in place for basically like 18 months and then COVID hit. And then the aftermath and everything and all the drama and headlines and everything. (02:07:02) And so the concern, including from some very smart people in the last two years has been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he going to be able to get a team that is as good as the team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? Because maybe people got burned out. Maybe they\u2019re more cynical now. Maybe they\u2019re not willing to go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people in the first term came under their own withering legal assaults, and some of them went to prison. A lot of stuff happened. Lots of investigations, lots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots of debanking by the way. A lot of the officials in the first Trump term got debanked, including the president\u2019s wife and son. Lex Fridman (02:07:39) Yeah. I heard you tell that story. That\u2019s insane. That\u2019s just insane. Marc Andreessen (02:07:41) In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and children with our ring of power. And so there\u2019s this legitimate question as to okay, what will the team for the second term look like? At least what I\u2019ve seen and what you\u2019re seeing with the appointments is it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks better than the first term and not because the people in the first term were not necessarily good, but you just have this influx of incredibly capable people that have shown up that want to be part of this and you just didn\u2019t have that the first time. And so they\u2019re just drawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool than they had the first time. And they\u2019re drawing on people who know what the game is. They\u2019re drawing on people now who know what is going to happen, and they\u2019re still willing to do it. (02:08:20) And so they\u2019re going to get, I think, some of the best people from the first term, but they\u2019re bringing in a lot of people who they couldn\u2019t get the first time around. And then second is there\u2019s a bunch of people, including people in the first term where they\u2019re just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned how everything works. Or there are young people who just had a different point of view and now they\u2019re 10 years older and they\u2019re ready to go serve in government. So there\u2019s a generational shift happening. And actually one of the interesting things about the team that\u2019s forming up is it\u2019s remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members and then many of the second and third level people are in their 30s and 40s, which is a big change from the gerontocracy that we\u2019ve been under for the last 30 years. (02:08:59) I think the caliber has been outstanding. And we could sit here and list tons and tons of people, but the people who are running. It\u2019s everything from the people who are running all the different departments at HHS. The number two at the Pentagon is Steve Feinberg, who\u2019s just an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. Actually two of my partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Many, many parts of the government the people are really impressive. Lex Fridman (02:09:25) Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the human being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let\u2019s say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there\u2019s circles of sycophancy that form. And if you\u2019re be able to be loyal and never oppose and just basically suck up to the president, that you\u2019ll get a position. So that\u2019s one of the concerns. And I think you\u2019re in a good position to speak to the degree that\u2019s happening versus hiring based on merit and just getting great teams. Marc Andreessen (02:10:06) Yeah. So look, start by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there\u2019s always some risk of that. That\u2019s like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so there\u2019s always some risk to that. Of course, the good powerful leaders are very aware of that. And Trump, at this point in his life, I think is highly aware of that, at least in my interactions with him. He definitely seems very aware of that. So that\u2019s one thing. I would just say, I think the way to look at that \u2026 And look, like I said, I don\u2019t want to predict what\u2019s going to happen once this whole thing starts unfolding. I would just say again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished people in the business world and in the medical field. Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH. I was part of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks. Lex Fridman (02:10:52) Nice. Jay\u2019s amazing. Oh, I was so happy to see that. Marc Andreessen (02:10:55) So I literally got \u2026 This is the story. I got to the transition office for one of the days of the HHS interviews, and I was on one of the interview interviewing teams. I didn\u2019t know who the candidates were, and they gave us the sheet in the beginning, and I go down the sheet and I saw Jay\u2019s name. I almost physically fell on my chair. And I was just like \u2026 I happen to know Jay. I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this \u2026 Talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure over the last five years. Lex Fridman (02:11:20) And then go radical under the pressure. He maintained balance and thoughtfulness and depth. Incredibly- Marc Andreessen (02:11:28) Very serious, very analytical, very applied. Yes. A hundred percent. Tested under pressure came out. The more people look back at what he said and did. None of us perfect, but overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. We would all be much better off today had he been in charge of the response. And so just an incredibly capable guy. And look, and then he learned from all that. He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody that could be head of NIH as compared to the people we\u2019ve had is just breathtakingly. It\u2019s just a gigantic upgrade. And then Marty McAree coming. Marc Andreessen (02:12:00) It is just a gigantic upgrade. And then Marty Makary coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a CDC, exact same thing. I\u2019ve been spending time with Dr. Oz. So again, I\u2019m not on these teams, I\u2019m not in the room, but I\u2019ve been spending enough time trying to help that his level of insight into the healthcare system, it\u2019s astounding. And it comes from being a guy who\u2019s been in the middle of the whole thing and been talking to people about this stuff, and working on it and serving as a doctor himself and in medical systems for his entire life. He\u2019s like a walking encyclopedia on these things. And very dynamic, very charismatic, very smart, organized, effective. So to have somebody like that in there. And so anyway, I have 30 of these stories now across all these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast to the last four years, and these people are not in the same ballpark, they\u2019re just wildly better. And so pound for pound this maybe the best team in the White House since, I don\u2019t even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s. Maybe Eisenhower had a team like this or something, but there\u2019s a lot of really good people in there now. DOGE Lex Fridman (02:13:16) Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high. Can you speak to DOGE? What\u2019s the most wildly successful next two years for DOGE, can you imagine? Maybe also can you think about the trajectory that\u2019s the most likely and what kind of challenges would it be facing? Marc Andreessen (02:13:36) Yeah, so start by saying, again, disclaimer, I have to say, I\u2019m not on DOGE, I\u2019m not a member of DOGE. Lex Fridman (02:13:43) We should say there\u2019s about 10 lawyers in the room, they\u2019re staring. No, I\u2019m just kidding. Marc Andreessen (02:13:48) Both the angels and the devils on my shoulder are literally [inaudible 02:13:51]. So I\u2019m not speaking for DOGE, I\u2019m not in charge of DOGE. Those guys are doing it, I\u2019m not doing it. But again, I\u2019m volunteering to help as much as I can and I\u2019m 100% supportive. Yeah, so look, I think the way to think, the basic outlines are in public, which is it\u2019s a time limited basically commission. It\u2019s not a formal government agency. It\u2019s a time limited, 18 month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the executive branch. And so the implementation will happen through the White House. And the president has total latitude on what he wants to implement. And then basically what I think about it is three streams, target sets, and they\u2019re related but different. So money, people, and regulations. And so the headline number they put as the $2 trillion number, and there\u2019s already disputes over that and whatever, and there\u2019s a whole question there. But then there\u2019s the people thing. (02:14:44) And the people thing is interesting, because you get into these very fascinating questions. And I\u2019ve been doing this, I won\u2019t do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this for people in government as a pop quiz and I can stump them every time. Which is, A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere between 450 and 520, and nobody\u2019s quite sure. And then the other is how many people work for the federal government? And the answer is something on the order, I forget, but like 4 million full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors, and nobody\u2019s quite sure. And so there\u2019s a large people component to this. And then by the way, there\u2019s a related component to that, which is how many of them are actually in the office? And the answer is not many, most of the federal buildings are still empty. (02:15:27) And then there\u2019s questions of are people working from home or are we actually working from home? So there\u2019s the people dimension, and of course the money and the people are connected. And then there\u2019s the third, which is the regulation thing. And I described earlier how basically our system of government is much more now based on regulations than legislation. Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that went through Congress, they\u2019re from an agency that created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very important. So one is Elon had already described the DOGE wants to do broad-based regulatory relief, and Trump has talked about this, and basically get the government off of people\u2019s backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that\u2019s part of it. But there\u2019s also something else that\u2019s happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a set of Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that went directly after the idea that the executive branch can create regulatory agencies, and issue regulations and enforce those regulations without corresponding congressional legislation. (02:16:20) And most of the federal government that exists today, including most of the departments and most of the rules and most of the money and most of the people, most of it is not enforcing laws that Congress passed. Most of it is regulation. And the Supreme Court basically said, \u201cLarge parts, large to maybe all of that regulation that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress, the way that the cartoon said that it should, may not actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, was super in favor of big government. They did nothing based on this, they didn\u2019t pull anything back in. But the new regime, if they choose to, could say, \u201cLook, the thing that we\u2019re doing here is not challenging the laws, we\u2019re actually complying with the Supreme Court decision that basically says we have to unwind a lot of this and we have to unwind the regulations which are no longer legal, constitutional. We have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind the people. (02:17:16) And that\u2019s how you get from basically you connect the thread from the regulation part back to the money part back to the people part. They have work going on all three of these threads. They have, I would say, incredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who 100% of them are super cynical on this topic, and they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is impossible, this could never possibly work.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t tell you what the secret plans are, but blow my mind.\u201d And all three of those, they have ideas that are really quite amazing, as you\u2019d expect from the people involved. And so over the course of the next few months, that\u2019ll start to become visible. And then the final thing I would say is this is going to be very different than attempts, there have been other programs like this in the past. The Clinton-Gore administration had one and then there were others before that, Reagan had one. The difference is this time, their social media, (02:18:13) It\u2019s interesting, one of the reasons people in Washington are so cynical is because they know all the bull shit. They know all the bad spending and all the bad rules. Look, we\u2019re adding a trillion dollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. And that\u2019s compounding, and it\u2019s now passing the size of the defense department budget and it\u2019s compounding, and pretty soon it\u2019s going to be adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it\u2019s going to be adding a trillion dollars every 80 days, and then it\u2019s going to be a trillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn\u2019t get fixed, at some point we enter a hyperinflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil, and [inaudible 02:18:44]. And so everybody in D.C. knows that something has to be done, and then everybody in D.C. knows for a fact that it\u2019s impossible to do anything. (02:18:54) They know all the problems and they also know the sheer impossibility of fixing it. But I think what they\u2019re not taking into account, what the critics are not taking into account is these guys can do this in the full light of day. And they can do it on social media, they can completely bypass the press, they can completely bypass the cynicism. They can expose any element of unconstitutional or silly government spending. They can run victory laps every single day on what they\u2019re doing. They can bring the people into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our Machiavellian structure, which is if you think about, again, you\u2019ve got democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule of the few, rule of the one. You could think about what\u2019s happening here as a little bit of a sandwich, which is we don\u2019t have a monarch, but we have a president, rule of the one with some power. (02:19:37) And then we have the people who can\u2019t organize, but they can be informed and they can be aware, and they can express themselves through voting and polling. So there\u2019s a sandwich happening right now is the way to think about it, which is you\u2019ve got basically rule of one combining with rule of many. And rule of many is they do get to vote, the people do get to vote basically, and then essentially Congress and this permanent bureaucratic class in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people I think have the power to do all kinds of things here, and I think that would be the way I would wash it. Lex Fridman (02:20:11) The transparency. Elon, just by who he is is incentivized to be transparent, and show the bull shit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it\u2019s going to be so exciting. It honestly just makes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. Marc Andreessen (02:20:31) These people are spending our money. These people have enormous contempt for the taxpayer. Okay, here\u2019s the thing you hear in Washington, here\u2019s one of the things. So the first thing you hear is, \u201cThis is impossible, they\u2019ll be able to do nothing.\u201d And then, yeah, I walk them through this and it starts to dawn on them that this is a new kind of thing. And then they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter, because all the money is in entitlements and the debt and the military.\u201d And so yeah, you\u2019ve got this silly, fake whatever, NPR funding or whatever, and just it\u2019s a rounding error and it doesn\u2019t matter. And you look it up in the budget and it\u2019s like, whatever, $500 million or $5 billion, or it\u2019s the charging stations that don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s the $40 billion of charging stations and they build eight charging stations, or it\u2019s the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody and cost you $30 billion, so these boondoggles. And what everybody in Washington says is that $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget, it doesn\u2019t matter. Who cares if they make it go away? And of course, any taxpayer is like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Lex Fridman (02:21:32) What do you mean? Marc Andreessen (02:21:33) It\u2019s $30 billion. And the press is in on this too, and then the experts are like, \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s rounding error.\u201d No, it\u2019s $30 billion. And if you\u2019re this cavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you are about the three trillion. Then there\u2019s the, okay, $30 billion. Is $30 billion a lot of the federal budget in percentage? No, it\u2019s not, but $30 billion divided by, do the math, $30 billion divided by let\u2019s say 300 million taxpayers. What\u2019s that math expert? Lex Fridman (02:21:34) $100. Marc Andreessen (02:21:57) $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out, it\u2019s a trip to the amusement park. It\u2019s the ability to buy additional educational materials. It\u2019s the ability to have a babysitter to be able to have a romantic relationship with your wife. There\u2019s 100 things that that person can do with $100 that they\u2019re not doing because it\u2019s going to some bull shit program that is being basically where the money\u2019s being looted out in the form of just ridiculous ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that that $30 billion program is not something that is a very important thing to go after, the level of contempt for the taxpayer is just off the charts. (02:22:40) And then that\u2019s just one of those programs, there\u2019s 100 of those programs. And they\u2019re all just like that, it\u2019s not like any of this stuff is running well. The one thing we know is that none of this stuff is running well, we know that for sure. And we know these people aren\u2019t showing up to work, and we know that all this crazy stuff is happening. Do you remember Elon\u2019s story of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay. So Pennsylvania is like a wonderful state, great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended other cities into just complete chaos, violent madness, and death. And the federal government has just let it happen, these incredibly violent places. (02:23:16) And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing law enforcement thing that they needed to do in Pennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling raw milk with armed raids. And it turns out it really pissed off the Amish. It turns out they weren\u2019t willing to drive to the polling places because they don\u2019t have cars, but if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why Trump won. Anyway, so the law enforcement agencies are off working on crazy things. The system\u2019s not working. And so you add up, just pick $130 billion programs, all right, now you\u2019re okay. Math major, 100 times 100. Lex Fridman (02:23:52) 10,000. Marc Andreessen (02:23:53) $10,000, okay. $10,000 per tax payer per year. Lex Fridman (02:23:57) But it\u2019s also not just about money, obviously money is a hugely important thing, but it\u2019s the cavalier attitude that then in the ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody wants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so that it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness. It breeds secrecy because you don\u2019t want to be transparent about having done nothing all year, all this kind of stuff. And you now want to reverse that so that it will be exciting for the future to work in government, because the amazing thing if you\u2019re the steelman government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can directly impact people\u2019s lives in a positive sense at scale. It\u2019s super exciting. As long as there\u2019s no bureaucracy that slows you down, or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. Marc Andreessen (02:24:53) Yeah. So here\u2019s the trick, this blew my mind. Because once you open the hellmouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. So there is a term of art in government called impoundment. So if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning is a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires Congress to authorize money to be spent by the executive branch. So the executive branch goes to Congress, says, \u201cWe need money X.\u201d Congress does their thing. They come back and they say, \u201cYou can have money Y.\u201d The money\u2019s appropriated from Congress, the executive branch spends it on the military or whatever they spend it on, or on roads to nowhere or charging stations to nowhere or whatever. And what\u2019s in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an additional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which is the executive branch not only needs Congress to appropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is not allowed to underspend. Lex Fridman (02:25:56) Yeah, I\u2019m aware of this. I\u2019m aware of this. Marc Andreessen (02:26:00) And so there\u2019s this thing that happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal year, which is September 30th, and it\u2019s the great budget flush. And any remaining money that\u2019s in the system that they don\u2019t know how to productively spend, they deliberately spend it unproductively, to the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. A president that doesn\u2019t want to spend the money can\u2019t not spend it. (02:26:20) Like, okay, A, that\u2019s not what\u2019s in the constitution. And there\u2019s actually quite a good Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this that\u2019s played out in the legal world over the last 60 years. And basically, if you look at this with anything resembling I think an open mind, you\u2019re like, \u201cAll right, this is not what the founders meant.\u201d And then number two, again, we go back to this thing of contempt. Can you imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that you\u2019re doing the right thing, and not going home at night and thinking that you\u2019ve sold your soul? I actually think you headed it a really good point, which is it\u2019s even unfair to the people who have to execute this because it makes them bad people, and they didn\u2019t start out wanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this. Lex Fridman (02:27:01) Yeah, everywhere. Marc Andreessen (02:27:01) Everywhere. And so we\u2019ll see how far these guys get. I am extremely encouraged, what I\u2019ve seen so far. H1B and immigration Lex Fridman (02:27:07) It seems like a lot of people will try to slow them down, but yeah, I hope they get far. Another difficult topic, immigration. What\u2019s your take on the, let\u2019s say, heated H-1B visa debate that\u2019s going on online and legal immigration in general? Marc Andreessen (02:27:22) I should start by saying I am not involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I\u2019m not planning to be, this is not an issue that I\u2019m working on or that I\u2019m going to work on. This is not part of the agenda of what the firm is doing, my firm is doing. So I\u2019m not in the new administration or the government, I\u2019m not planning to be, so purely just personal opinion. So I would say I would describe this as I have a complex or nuanced, hopefully nuanced view on this issue that\u2019s maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I thought about this, I didn\u2019t say anything about it all the way through the big debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a lot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a very different perspective on some of these things, and the reason is because of the combination of where I came from and then where I ended up. (02:28:09) Let\u2019s start with this, where I ended up, in Silicon Valley, and I have made the pro high-skilled immigration argument many, many times, the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I\u2019ve been in D.C. many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of trying to get more H-1B\u2019s and trying to get more high-skilled immigration. And I think that argument is very strong and very solid, and has paid off for the US in many, many ways. And we can go through it, but I think it\u2019s the argument everybody already knows, it\u2019s like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B\u2019s. So everybody gets that argument. Lex Fridman (02:28:46) So it\u2019s basically, just to summarize, it\u2019s a mechanism by which you can get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity of the US companies. Marc Andreessen (02:28:58) And then it\u2019s not just good for them and it\u2019s not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry, it\u2019s good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that then create many more jobs for Americans, native born Americans, than would\u2019ve previously existed. And so it\u2019s a positive, some flywheel thing where everybody wins. Everybody wins, there are no trade-offs, it\u2019s all absolutely glorious in all directions. There cannot possibly be a moral argument against it under any circumstances. Anybody who argues against it is obviously doing so from a position of racism, is probably a fascist and a Nazi. That\u2019s the thing, and like I said, I\u2019ve made that argument many times. I\u2019m very comfortable with that argument. And then I\u2019d also say, look, I would say number one, I believe a lot of it, I\u2019ll talk about the parts I don\u2019t believe, but I believe a lot of it. (02:29:43) And then the other part is, look, I benefit every day. I always describe it as I work in the United Nations, my own firm and our founders and our companies and the industry and my friends are just this amazing panoply, cornucopia of people from all over the world. And I\u2019ve worked, I don\u2019t know, at this point with people from, it\u2019s got to be, I don\u2019t know, 80 countries or something, and hopefully over time it\u2019ll be the rest as well. And it\u2019s been amazing, and they\u2019ve done many of the most important things in my industry and it\u2019s been really remarkable. So that\u2019s all good. And then there\u2019s just the practical version of the argument, which is we are the main place these people get educated anyway. The best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so this is the old Mitt Romney, staple a green card to maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree. Maybe the sociologists we could quibble about, but the roboticists for sure, for sure. For sure, we can all agree that- Lex Fridman (02:30:40) At least I won you over on something today. Marc Andreessen (02:30:42) Well, no, I\u2019m exaggerating for effect. Lex Fridman (02:30:45) And I lost you, I had you for half a second. Marc Andreessen (02:30:48) I haven\u2019t gotten to the other side of the argument yet. Lex Fridman (02:30:49) Okay, thank you. Marc Andreessen (02:30:50) So surely we can all agree that we need to staple a green card. Lex Fridman (02:30:54) The rollercoaster is going up. Marc Andreessen (02:30:55) The rollercoaster is ratcheting slowly up. So yeah, so surely we can all agree that the roboticists should all get green cards. And again, there\u2019s a lot of merit to that, obviously. Look, we want the US to be the world leader in robotics. What\u2019s step one to being the world leader in robotics is have all the great robotics people. Unlike the underpants, it\u2019s like a very straightforward formula. All right, that\u2019s all well and good, all right, but it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a argument that\u2019s right underneath that that you also hear from these same people. And I have made this argument myself many times, which is we need to do this because we don\u2019t have enough people in the US who can do it otherwise. We have all these unfilled jobs, we\u2019ve got all these companies that wouldn\u2019t exist. (02:31:33) We don\u2019t have enough good founders, we don\u2019t have enough engineers, we don\u2019t have enough scientists. Or then the next version of the argument below that is our education system is not good enough to generate those people, which is a weird argument by the way. Because our education system is good enough for foreigners to be able to come here preferentially in a very large number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native foreign people. So there\u2019s little cracks in the matrix that you can stick your fingernail into and wonder about and we\u2019ll come back to that one. But at least, yes, our education system has its flaws. And then underneath that is the argument that Vivek made, which is we have cultural rot in the country and native-born people in the country don\u2019t work hard enough, and spend too much time watching TV and TikTok and don\u2019t spend enough time studying differential equations. (02:32:19) And again, it\u2019s like, all right, yeah, there\u2019s a fair amount to that. There\u2019s a lot of American culture that is, there\u2019s a lot of frivolity, we have well-documented social issues on many fronts, many things that cut against having a culture of just straightforward, high achievement and effort and striving. But anyway, those are the basic arguments. But then I have this other side of my personality and thought process, which is, well, I grew up in a small farming town of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest, and it\u2019s interesting, there\u2019s not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin to high tech. (02:32:54) And so it\u2019s like, all right, why is that exactly? And I know this, I\u2019m an aberration. I was the only one from anybody I ever knew who ever did this. I know what an aberration I am and I know exactly how that aberration happened, and it\u2019s a very unusual set of steps, including many that were just luck. But there is in no sense a talent flow from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like not at all. There is also in no sense a talent flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from the south into high tech. There is no flow from the Sunbelt into high tech. There\u2019s no flow from the deep south into high tech. Literally, it\u2019s like the blanks. There\u2019s this whole section of the country where the people just for some reason don\u2019t end up in tech. (02:33:38) Now, that\u2019s a little bit strange, because these are the people who put a man on the moon. These are the people who built the World War II War Machine. These are the people, at least their ancestors are the people who built the second industrial revolution, and built the railroads and built the telephone network and built logistics and transportation in the auto industry. The auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. And so at least these people\u2019s parents and grandparents and great grandparents somehow had the wherewithal to build all of these amazing things, invent all these things. (02:34:07) And then there\u2019s many, many, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation and capitalism, where you had people who grew up in the middle of nowhere, Philo Farnsworth who invented the television, and just tons and tons of others, endless stories like this. Now you have a puzzle and the conundrum, which is like, okay, what is happening on the blank spot of the map? And then of course, you also can\u2019t help noticing that the blank spot on the map, the Midwest, the South, you\u2019ve also just defined Trump country, the Trump voter base. (02:34:35) And it\u2019s like, oh, well, that\u2019s interesting. How did that happen? And so either you really, really, really have to believe the very, very strong version of the Vivek thesis or something, where you have to believe that that basically culture, the whole civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the country is so deeply flawed, either inherently flawed or culturally flawed, such that for whatever reason, they\u2019re not able to do the things that their parents and grandparents were able to do, and that their peers are able to do. Or something else is happening. Would you care to guess on what else is happening? Lex Fridman (02:35:03) You mean what, affirmative action? Marc Andreessen (02:35:05) Affirmative action. Think about this, this is very entertaining. What are the three things that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary, however, it cannot explain the success of any one individual, nor does it have any victims at all. Lex Fridman (02:35:25) That could explain maybe disproportionate, but surely it doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re probably the only person in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin. Marc Andreessen (02:35:34) What educational institution in the last 60 years has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin? Lex Fridman (02:35:38) But what institution rejected farm boys from Wisconsin? Marc Andreessen (02:35:42) All of them. Lex Fridman (02:35:43) All of them. Marc Andreessen (02:35:43) Of course. Okay, so we know this, we know this. The reason we know this is because of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. This was three years ago, these were big court cases. Because the idea of affirmative action has been litigated for many, many, many years and through many court cases, and the Supreme Court repeatedly in the past had upheld that it was a completely legitimate thing to do. And there\u2019s basically two categories of affirmative action that really matter. One is the admissions into educational institutions and then the other is jobs, getting hired. Those are the two biggest areas. The education one is super potent, has been a super potent political issue for a very long time for all\u2026 People have written and talked about this for many decades, I don\u2019t need to go through it. There\u2019s many arguments for why it\u2019s important, there\u2019s many arguments as to how it could backfire. It\u2019s been this thing. (02:36:25) But the Supreme Court upheld it for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I\u2019m not a lawyer, I don\u2019t have the exact reference in my head, but there was a case in 2003 that said that Sandra Day O\u2019Connor famously wrote that although it had been 30 years of affirmative action and although it was not working remotely as it had been intended, she said that, well, basically we need to try it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future Supreme Court justices, if it hasn\u2019t resolved basically the issues it\u2019s intended to resolve within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we\u2019re coming up on the 25 years, it\u2019s a couple of years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases, it\u2019s a Harvard case and I think a University of North Carolina case. (02:37:07) And what\u2019s interesting about those cases is the lawyers in those cases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions decisions actually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit as cartoonishly garish and racist as you could possibly imagine, because it\u2019s a ring of power. And if you\u2019re an admissions officer at a private university or an administrator, you have unlimited power to do what you want, and you can justify any of it under any of these rules or systems. And up until these cases, it had been a black box where you didn\u2019t have to explain yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and UNC cases did is they basically required showing the work. And there was all kinds of phenomenal detail, number one is there were text messages in there that will just curl your hair, of students being spoken of and just crude racial stereotypes that would just make you want to jump out the window. It\u2019s horrible stuff. (02:37:58) But also, there was statistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole thing is that at top institutions, it\u2019s common for different ethnic groups to have different cutoffs for SAT that are as wide as 400 points. So different groups. So specifically Asians need to perform at 400 SAT points higher than other ethnicities in order to actually get admitted into these. White people are a part of this, but Asians are a very big part of this. And actually the Harvard case is actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually the Asian students who are being turned away. And it\u2019s the cliche now in the valley and in the medical community, which is like, if you want a super genius you hire an Asian from Harvard, because they are guaranteed to be freaking Einstein. Because if they weren\u2019t, they were never getting admitted. Almost all the qualified Asians get turned away. (02:38:47) So they\u2019ve been running this, it\u2019s a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been a third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really changed the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that they can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a single education institution in America that is conforming with the Supreme Court ruling, I think they\u2019re all flagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that. Lex Fridman (02:39:14) Mostly because of momentum probably, or what? Marc Andreessen (02:39:16) They are trying to make the world a better place. They\u2019re trying to solve all these social problems, They are trying to have diverse student populations. They are trying to live up to the expectations of their donors. They\u2019re trying to make their faculty happy. They are trying to have their friends and family think that they\u2019re good people. They\u2019re trying to have the press write nice things about them. It\u2019s nearly impossible for them. And to be clear, nobody has been fired from an admissions office for 25 years and prior, what the Supreme Court now is ruled to be illegality. And so they\u2019re all the same people under the exact same pressures. And so the numbers are moving a little bit, but I don\u2019t know anybody in the system who thinks that they are complying with Supreme Court. Like who\u2019s in charge, in the rank ordering of who rules who, the university\u2019s rule the Supreme Court way more than the Supreme Court rules the universities. (02:40:05) Well, another example of that is I think that every sitting member of the Supreme Court right now went to either Harvard or Yale, the level of incestuousness here is\u2026 Anyway, so there\u2019s that. And so this has been running for a very long time. So one is the Harvard and UNC cases gave up the game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the other thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, and what we discovered was happening with Jewish applicants and what was happening at all the top institutions for Jewish applicants was they were being managed down, either being actively managed down as a percentage of the base. And let\u2019s say I\u2019ve heard reports of extremely explicit basically plans to manage the Jewish admissions down to their representative percentage of the US population, which is 2%. And there\u2019s a whole backstory here, which is 100 years ago, Jews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions, and then there was a big campaign to get them in. (02:40:57) Once they could get in, they immediately became 30% of these institutions because there are so many smart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%, and then the most recent generation of leadership has been trying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish people I know, they kind of knew this was happening but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th. So basically the Supreme Court case meant that you could address this in terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in terms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded. And then of course, there\u2019s the thing that you basically can\u2019t talk about, which is all the white people are being excluded. And then it turns out it\u2019s also happening to black people, and this is the thing that blew my freaking mind when I found out about it. (02:41:44) So I just assumed that this was great news for American Blacks, because obviously if Whites, Asians, and Jews are being excluded, then the whole point of this in the beginning was to get the Black population up, and so this must be great for American Blacks. So then I discovered this New York Times article from 2004 called Blacks are Being Admitted into Top Schools at Greater Numbers, but which ones? And by the way, this is in the New York Times, this is not in, whatever, The National Review, this is New York Times, 2004. And the two authorities that were quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who\u2019s the dean of the African-American Studies community in the United States, super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, she was a potential Supreme Court appointee under, I think she was a close friend of Hillary Clinton. (02:42:32) And there was for a long time, she was on the short list for Supreme Court. So one of the top jurists, lawyers in the country, but both Black, legendarily successful in the academic and legal worlds and Black. And they are quoted as the authorities in this story, and the story that they tell, it\u2019s actually amazing. And by the way, it\u2019s happening today in education institutions and it\u2019s happening in companies, and you can see it all over the place, and the government. Which is at least at that time, the number was half of the Black admits into a place like Harvard were not American-born Blacks, they were foreign-born Blacks, specifically Northern African, generally Nigerian or West Indian. (02:43:18) And by the way, many Nigerians and Northern Africans have come to the US and have been very successful. Nigerian-Americans as a group way outperform, they\u2019re just a super smart cohort of people. And then West Indian Blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, as well as Colin Powell, just two examples of that. And so basically what Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier said in the story is Harvard is basically struggling to either, whatever it was, identify, recruit, make successful, whatever it was, American-born native Blacks, and so therefore they were using high-skill immigration as an escape hatch to go get Blacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things, obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since, it has sailed on. All of the DEI programs of the last 20 years have had this exact characteristic. (02:44:08) There\u2019s large numbers of Black people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not us that are getting these slots, we\u2019re literally competing with people who are being imported.\u201d And if you believe in the basis of affirmative action, you were trying to make up for historical injustice of American Black slavery. So the idea that you import somebody from Nigeria that never experienced that is tremendously insulting to Black Americans. Anyway, so you can see where I\u2019m heading with this. We have been in a 60-year social engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into. And so it turns out it\u2019s not a victim-free thing, there\u2019s 100%, there\u2019s victims. Because why? There\u2019s only so many, for sure there\u2019s only so many education slots, and then for sure, there\u2019s only so many of these jobs. Google only hires so many, whatever, level seven engineers. And so that\u2019s the other side of it, and so you\u2019re a farm boy in Wisconsin. Lex Fridman (02:45:00) So, that\u2019s the other side of it. And so, you\u2019re a farm boy in Wisconsin, or a Black American whose ancestors arrived here on a slave ship, 300 years ago, in Louisiana, or a Cambodian immigrant in the Bronx, and you are a kid, or a Jewish immigrant, or from a very successful Jewish family, and for three generations, you and your parents and grandparents went to Harvard, and what all of those groups know is the system that has been created is not for them. It\u2019s designed specifically to exclude them, and then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, yeah, let\u2019s bring in more foreigners. So, anyway, so the short version of it is, you can\u2019t anymore, I don\u2019t think, just have the \u201chigh-skilled immigration,\u201d conversation for either education or for employment without also having the DEI conversation. (02:45:53) And then DEI is just another word for affirmative action, so it\u2019s the affirmative action conversation. And you need to actually deal with this at substance and to see what\u2019s actually happening to people, you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for high-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took over both the education process and the hiring process. Marc Andreessen (02:46:15) So, first of all, that was brilliantly laid out, the nuance of it. So, just to understand, it\u2019s not so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it\u2019s that there needs to be more people saying, yay, we need more American- born hires. Lex Fridman (02:46:31) So, I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on this and not saying anything, and what I was\u2026 Which you know me well enough to know that\u2019s a serious level of- Marc Andreessen (02:46:40) Yeah, that was very Zen. Lex Fridman (02:46:41) Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn\u2019t, there was tremendous rage on the other side of it, but I suppressed it. So, I was waiting for the dog that didn\u2019t bark, and the dog that didn\u2019t bark was I did not\u2026 And tell me if you saw one. I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart kids who are already here into these educational institutions and into these jobs. I didn\u2019t see a single one. Marc Andreessen (02:47:07) That\u2019s true, I think I agree with that. There really was a divide. Lex Fridman (02:47:12) But it was literally, it was like the proponents of high-skilled immigrant\u2026 And again, this was me for a very long time. I kind of took myself by surprise on this because I had the much, say, simpler version of this story for a very long\u2026 Like I said, I\u2019ve been in Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about, it never actually worked. But I\u2019ve been on the other side of this one. But I was literally sitting there being like, all right, which of these super geniuses, many of whom by the way are very successful, high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled immigrants, which of these super geniuses are going to say, actually we have this incredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I\u2019m not talking about white people, I\u2019m talking about native-born Americans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure, those four groups, Marc Andreessen (02:47:55) But also white people. Lex Fridman (02:47:57) Yeah, and also white people. Marc Andreessen (02:47:59) People that are making the case for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It\u2019s an extreme divide, and those people, they\u2019re making that case are often not making it in a way that\u2019s\u2026 Making it in quite a radical way, let\u2019s put it this way. Lex Fridman (02:48:20) Yeah, yeah. But you have this interesting thing, you have a split between the sides that I\u2019ve noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. And I\u2019m using air quote for people listening to audio, I\u2019m making quotes in the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can. One side has all the certified experts, the other side just has a bunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don\u2019t quite know how to explain it. And what was so unusual about the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of the Supreme Court is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record. They actually had experts, which is just really rare. (02:48:51) Generally what you get is you get\u2026 Because if you don\u2019t have experts, what do you have? You know something is wrong, but you have primarily an emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it into the words and tables and charts that a certified expert can? No, you can\u2019t, that\u2019s not who you are. That doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re wrong, and it also doesn\u2019t mean that you have less of a moral stance. And so, it\u2019s just like, all right\u2026 Now, by the way, look, I think there are ways to square the circle, I think there\u2019s a way to have our cake and eat it too, I think there\u2019d be many ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with high-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is under much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for universities to do that, they are still doing it, but they should stop. (02:49:46) And then, there are more and more, you\u2019ve seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part\u2026 That\u2019s happening for a bunch of reasons, but it\u2019s happening in part because a lot of corporate lawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court rulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just is a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so, there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let me add one more nuance to it though, that makes it even more complicated. So, the clich\u00e9 is we\u2019re going to brain drain the world, you\u2019ve heard that? We\u2019re going to take all the smart people from all over the world, we\u2019re going to bring them here, we\u2019re going to educate them, and then we\u2019re going to keep them, and then they\u2019re going to raise their families here, create businesses here, create jobs here, right? Marc Andreessen (02:50:28) In the clich\u00e9, that\u2019s a super positive thing. Lex Fridman (02:50:30) Yeah. Okay, so what happens to the rest of the world? Marc Andreessen (02:50:35) They lose? Lex Fridman (02:50:36) Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious, highly conscientious, highly energetic, high achieving, high IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there\u2019s a lot, that\u2019s great, but if there just aren\u2019t that many, and they all come here, and they aren\u2019t where they would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So, it\u2019s almost impossible for us here to have that conversation, in part because we become incredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren\u2019t just simply all the same, which is a whole thing we could talk about, but also we are purely the beneficiary of this effect. We are brain draining the world, not the other way around. There\u2019s only four\u2026 So, if you look at the flow of high-skilled immigration over time, there\u2019s only four permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration places people go. It\u2019s the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia. Marc Andreessen (02:51:31) Oh, Australia. Lex Fridman (02:51:32) It\u2019s four of the five, five eyes. It\u2019s the major Anglosphere countries. And so, for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it\u2019s all the other countries that, basically, what we four countries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It\u2019s actually much easier for people in Europe to talk about this I\u2019ve discovered, because the Eurozone is, whatever, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over time have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I think it\u2019s the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they\u2019ve been migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this really hit the fan was in Greece. So, Greece falls into chaos, disaster, and then you\u2019re running the government in Greece and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to put an economic development plan together, all of your smart young kids have left, what are you going to do? (02:52:19) By the way, this is a potential\u2026 I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. In part because of this, because we enthusiastically recruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we\u2019ve been brain draining Ukraine for a long time, but also, of course, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, when it comes time for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it going to have the talent base even that it had five years ago, is a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, we have brain drained a lot of really smart people out of Russia, a lot of them are here, over the last 30 years. And so, there\u2019s this thing, it\u2019s actually really funny if you think about it, the one thing that we know to be the height of absolute evil that the West ever did was colonization and resource extraction. (02:53:03) So, we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and the English and everybody else went and had these colonies, and then went in and we took all the oil, and we took all the diamonds, or we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is. Well, for some reason we realized that that\u2019s a deeply evil thing to do when it\u2019s a physical resource, when it\u2019s a non-conscious physical matter, for some reason we think it\u2019s completely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it\u2019s glorious and beautiful and wonderful and the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral justice of our time to do it, and we don\u2019t think for one second what we\u2019re doing to the countries that we\u2019re pulling all these people out of. (02:53:38) And this is one of these things, I don\u2019t know, maybe we\u2019re just going to live in this delusional state forever, and we\u2019ll just keep doing it, and it\u2019ll keep benefiting us, and we just won\u2019t care what happens, but I think there may come\u2026 This is one of these submarines 10 feet under the water line, I think it\u2019s just a matter of time until people suddenly realize, oh my God, what are we doing? We need the rest of the world to succeed too, we need these other countries to flourish. We don\u2019t want to be the only successful country in the middle of just complete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and we extract and we extract, and we don\u2019t think twice about it. Marc Andreessen (02:54:11) This is so deeply profound, actually. So, what is the cost of \u201cwinning\u201d if these countries are drained in terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics, what does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually want them to be strong, in the way we understand strong, not just in every way, so that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. It\u2019s interesting, this is one of those truths where you just speak and it resonates, and I didn\u2019t even think about it. Lex Fridman (02:54:51) Yeah, exactly. Marc Andreessen (02:54:53) So, you were sitting during the holiday season, just boiling over. So, all that said, there\u2019s still to use some good to the H-1B? Lex Fridman (02:55:03) Okay, so then you get this other\u2026 Okay, so then there\u2019s- Marc Andreessen (02:55:03) Come all the way around. Lex Fridman (02:55:06) \u2026 there\u2019s another nuance. So there\u2019s another nuance, there\u2019s another nuance, which is mostly in the valley we don\u2019t use H-1Bs anymore, mostly we use O1s. So, there\u2019s a separate class of these, and the O1 is like this\u2026 It turns out the O1 is the super genius visa. So, the O1 is basically our founder\u2026 When we have somebody from anywhere in the world, and they\u2019ve invented a breakthrough new technology, and they want to come to the US to start a company, they come in through an O1 Visa. And that actually, it\u2019s a fairly high bar, it\u2019s a high acceptance rate, but it\u2019s a pretty high bar, and they do a lot of work, and you have to put real work into it, really prove your case. Mostly what\u2019s happened with the H-1B Visa program is that it has gone to basically two categories of employers. (02:55:47) One is basically a small set of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies that you would think, and then the other is it goes to these, what they call the mills, the consulting mills. And so, there\u2019s these set of companies with names, I don\u2019t want to pick on companies, but names like Cognizant, that hire, basically have their business model is bringing in primarily Indians in large numbers, and they often have offices next to company-owned housing, and they\u2019ll have organizations that are literally thousands of Indians living and working in the US, and they do basically call it mid-tier IT consulting. So, these folks, they\u2019re making good wages, but they\u2019re making 60 or 80 a or 100,000 a year, not the 300,000 that you\u2019d make in the Valley. (02:56:34) And so, in practice, the startups, basically little tech as we call it, or the startup world, mainly doesn\u2019t use H-1Bs at this point, and mainly can\u2019t, because the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can\u2019t. And then, again, you get to the underlying morality here, which is, it\u2019s like, well, Amazon, Amazon\u2019s\u2026 I love Amazon. But they\u2019re a big powerful company, they\u2019ve got more money than God, they\u2019ve got resources, they\u2019ve got long-term planning horizon, they do big profound things over decades at a time, they could, or any of these other companies, could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you\u2019ll notice they don\u2019t do that, they bring in 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so, you\u2019ve got a question there, and then these mills, there\u2019s lots of questions around them, and whether that\u2019s even an ethical way\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say they\u2019re unethical, but there\u2019s questions around exactly what the trade-offs are there. And this like is a Pandora\u2019s box that really nobody really wanted to be opened. To play devil\u2019s advocate in all this, in terms of national immigration issues, none of this is a top end issue, just because the numbers are small, and so I don\u2019t think, the administration has said this is not a priority of theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is, there is actually a lot of complexity and nuance here. Like I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues who came over on H-1Bs or O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens, and every single one of them was\u2026 Not every single one. A lot of them were enthusiastic to defend the honor of immigrants throughout this whole period. And they said to me, it\u2019s like, well, Marc, how can we more clearly express the importance of high school immigration to the US? (02:58:14) And I was like, I think you can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent. Do you want to inflame the issue or do you want to diffuse the issue? I think the answer is to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one more positive scenario, and then I\u2019ll also beat up on the university some more. Do you know about the National Merit Scholarship System, have you heard about this? Marc Andreessen (02:58:39) Not really, can you explain? Lex Fridman (02:58:40) So, there\u2019s a system that was created during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars, and it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the 50s or 60s when\u2026 It was people in government actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an idea as that sounds today. And so, it\u2019s basically a national talent search for, basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify basically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country. By the way, completely regardless of other characteristics. So, there\u2019s no race, gender, or any other aspect to it, it\u2019s just going for straight intelligence. It uses, first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory SAT that you take, and then the SAT. So, it uses those scores, that is the scoring, it\u2019s a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. They use the SAT as a proxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to 1% of the population of the kids, of 18 year olds in an given year, who score highest on the PSAT, and then they further qualify down to the 0.5% that also replicate on the SAT. And then it\u2019s like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500. So, it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it\u2019s a national system being run, literally, to find the best and the brightest. How many of our great and powerful universities use this as a scouting system? Our universities all have sports teams, they all have national scouting, they have full-time scouts who go out and they go to every high school and they try to find all the great basketball players and bring them into the NCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities use the National Merit System to go do a talent search for the smartest kids and just bring them in? Marc Andreessen (03:00:21) Let me guess, very few. Zero. Lex Fridman (03:00:23) Zero. As you say it, that\u2019s brilliant, there should be that same level of scouting for talent internally. Marc Andreessen (03:00:30) Go get the smartest ones. I\u2019ll give you one more kicker on this topic, if I haven\u2019t beaten it to death. The SAT has changed. So, the SAT used to be a highly accurate proxy for IQ that caused a bunch of problems, people really don\u2019t like the whole idea of IQ. And so, the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the college board that runs it, and it has been, essentially, like everything else, it\u2019s been dumbed down, in two ways. Number one, it\u2019s been dumbed down where an 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. And 40 years ago, it was almost impossible to get an 800. Today, there\u2019s so many 800s that you could stock the entire Ivy League with 800s, and so it\u2019s been deliberately dumbed down. And then, two is, they have tried to pull out a lot of what\u2019s called the g-loading. (03:01:21) And so they, they\u2019ve tried to detach it from being an IQ proxy because IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they\u2019ve made it more coachable, right? So, the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn\u2019t really work, and more recently it has really started to work. And one of the things you see is that the Asian spike, you see this giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade, and I think, looking at the data, I think a lot of that is because it\u2019s more coachable now, and the Asians do the most coaching. So, there\u2019s a bunch of issues with this. And so, the coaching thing is really difficult because the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids whose parents can afford coaching, and I don\u2019t know about you, but where I grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So, there\u2019s an issue there. I didn\u2019t even know what the SAT was until the day I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work, so much less we could afford it. (03:02:08) So, number one, there\u2019s issues there. But the other issue there is think about what\u2019s happened by the dumbing down, 800 no longer captures all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test. It\u2019s like the AI benchmarking problem. It\u2019s the same problem they have AI benchmarking right now, 800 is too low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800. Because what you want is you want, whatever, if it\u2019s going to be 100,000 kids, I don\u2019t know what it is, if it\u2019s going to be 50,000 kids a year scoring 800, you also then want kids to be able to score 900 and 1000, and 1100, and 1200, and you want to ultimately get to, you\u2019d like to ultimately identify the top 100 kids, and make sure that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the test has been reduced so that it actually is not useful for doing that. (03:02:49) And again, I would say this is part of the generalized corruption that\u2019s taken place throughout this entire system, where we have been heading in the reverse direction from wanting to actually go get the best and brightest and actually put them in the places where they should be. And then, just the final comment would be, the great thing about standardized testing and the National Merit System is it\u2019s, like I said, it\u2019s completely race blind, it\u2019s gender blind, it\u2019s blind on every other characteristic, it\u2019s only done on test scores. And you can make an argument about whether that\u2019s good or bad, but it is, for sure, it\u2019s the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they thought they needed merit to win the Cold War. (03:03:23) And of course, we could choose to do that anytime we want. And I just say, I find it incredibly striking, and an enormous moral indictment of the current system that there are no universities that do this today. So, back to the immigration thing, just real quick, it\u2019s like, okay, we aren\u2019t even trying to go get the smart kids out of [inaudible 03:03:39], and even if they think that they can get into these places, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians, and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for the smart Black people. And I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s moral, I don\u2019t get it at all. Lex Fridman (03:03:54) As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times, and I\u2019ve always gotten perfect on math, 800. And I\u2019m not special, it doesn\u2019t identify genius, I think you want to search for genius. And you want to create measures that find genius of all different kinds, speaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and over, defend immigrants, yes, but say we should hire more and more native-born. Marc Andreessen (03:04:32) Well, you asked me in the beginning what\u2019s the most optimistic forecast that we could have? And the most optimistic forecast would be, my God, what if we did both? Lex Fridman (03:04:44) So, that\u2019s the reasonable, the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don\u2019t have to have a war. Marc Andreessen (03:04:50) Well, it would defuse, it would defuse the entire issue. Lex Fridman (03:04:52) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (03:04:53) If everybody in the center and the South of the country, and every Jewish family, Asian family, Black family knew they were getting a fair shake, it would defuse the issue. How about defusing the issue? What a crazy radical\u2026 Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to really get out over my skis here, but\u2026 Little tech Lex Fridman (03:05:06) I think your profile on X states, it\u2019s time to build. It feels like 2025 is a good year to build. So, I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for anybody who\u2019s trying to build, who is trying to build something useful in the world. Maybe launch a startup, or maybe just launch apps, services, whatever, ship software products. So, maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? Marc Andreessen (03:05:44) So, a big part of the answer I think is we\u2019re in the middle of a legit revolution, and I know you\u2019ve been talking about this on your show. But AI coding, this is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, maybe since the invention of software. And we\u2019re involved in various of these companies, but these tools, from a variety of companies, are absolutely revolutionary, and they\u2019re getting better by leaps and bounds every day. And you know all this. But the thing with coding, there\u2019s open questions of whether AI can get better at, I don\u2019t know, understanding philosophy, or whatever, creative writing or whatever, but for sure we can make it much better at coding, because you can validate the results of coding. And so, there\u2019s all these methods of synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning that, for sure, you can do with coding. (03:06:30) And so, everybody I know who works in the field says AI coding is going to get to be phenomenally good. And it\u2019s already great. And anybody who wants to see this, just go on YouTube and look at AI coding demos, little kids making apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so, I think it\u2019s the golden age\u2026 I think this is an area where it\u2019s clearly the golden age. The tool set is extraordinary. In a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain yourself, start using these things, get a huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more quickly than you could before. Lex Fridman (03:07:00) That\u2019s actually a tricky one in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff, I feel like you still need to learn how to code. It becomes a superpower, it helps you be much more productive. You could legitimately be a one person company and get quite far. Marc Andreessen (03:07:19) I agree with that, up to a point. So, I think, for sure, for quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are going to be the best at actually having AIs code things, because they\u2019re going to understand what, very basic, they\u2019re going to understand what\u2019s happening. And they\u2019re going to be able to evaluate the work, and they\u2019re going to be able to literally manage AIs better, even if they\u2019re not literally handwriting the code, they\u2019re just going to have a much better sense of what\u2019s going on. So, I definitely think, 100% my nine-year-old is doing all kinds of coding classes, and he\u2019ll keep doing that for, certainly through 18, we\u2019ll see after that. And so, for sure that\u2019s the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you can do with an AI is say, teach me how to code. (03:07:58) And there\u2019s a whole bunch of, I\u2019ll name names, Khan Academy\u2026 There\u2019s a whole bunch of work that they\u2019re doing at Khan Academy for free, and then we have this company, Replit, which was originally specifically built for kids for coding, that has AI built in, that\u2019s just absolutely extraordinary now. And then, there\u2019s a variety of other systems like this. Yeah, the AI is going to be able to teach to code\u2026 AI, by the way, is, as you know, is spectacularly good at explaining code. And so, the tools have these features now where you can talk to the code base, and so you can literally ask the code base questions about itself. And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and paste code into a ChatGPT and just ask it to explain it, what\u2019s going on, rewrite it, improve it, make recommendations. And so, there\u2019s dozens of ways to do this. (03:08:46) By the way, you can also, even more broadly than code, like, okay, you want to make a video game, okay, now you can do AI, art generation, sound generation, dialogue generation, voice generation, all of a sudden you don\u2019t need designers, you don\u2019t need voice actors. Yeah, there\u2019s just unlimited\u2026And then a big part of coding is so-called glue, it\u2019s interfacing into other systems. So, it\u2019s interfacing into Stripe, to take payments, or something like that, and AI is fantastic at writing glue code. So, really, really good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you figure out how to deploy. It\u2019ll even write a business plan for you. So, it\u2019s just this, it\u2019s like everything happening with AI right now, it\u2019s like this latent superpower, and there\u2019s this incredible spectrum of people who have really figured out massive performance increases, productivity increases with it already, there\u2019s other people who aren\u2019t even aware it\u2019s happening. (03:09:39) And there\u2019s some gearing to whether you\u2019re a coder or not, but I think there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races, and I think there are lots of professional coders who are still like, eh\u2026 The blacksmiths were not necessarily in favor of the car business. So, there\u2019s the old William Gibson quote, \u201cThe future is here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed yet,\u201d and this is maybe the most potent version of that that I\u2019ve ever seen. Lex Fridman (03:10:04) Yeah, there\u2019s the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \u201cAI coding is the future.\u201d It\u2019s very common, the programmers to say, if you\u2019re any good of a programmer, you\u2019re not going to be using it, that\u2019s just not true. I consider myself a reasonably good programmer and my productivity has been just skyrocketed, and the joy of programming skyrocketed, every aspect of programming is more efficient, more productive, more fun, all of that kind of stuff. Marc Andreessen (03:10:38) I would also say code has, of anything in industrial society, code has the highest elasticity, which is to say the easier it is to make it, the more of it gets made. I think effectively there\u2019s unlimited demand for code. In other words, there\u2019s always some other idea for a thing that you can do, a feature that you can add, or a thing that you can optimize. And so, overwhelmingly, the amount of code that exists in the world is a fraction of even the ideas we have today, and then we come up with new ideas all the time. And so, I think that\u2026 I was, in the late 80s, early 90s, when automated coding systems started to come out, expert systems, a big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called The Decline and Fall of the American Programmer, that predicted that these new coding systems were going to mean we wouldn\u2019t have programmers in the future, and of course, the number of programming jobs exploded by a factor of 100. (03:11:27) My guess is we\u2019ll have more coding jobs probably by an order of magnitude 10 years from now. That will be different, they\u2019ll be different jobs, they\u2019ll involve orchestrating AI, but we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry will just explode in size. Lex Fridman (03:11:44) Are you seeing the size of companies decrease in terms of startups? What\u2019s the landscapes of little tech? Marc Andreessen (03:11:51) All we\u2019re seeing right now is the AI hiring boom of all time. Lex Fridman (03:11:55) Oh, for the big tech? Marc Andreessen (03:11:57) And little tech. Lex Fridman (03:11:57) And little tech. Marc Andreessen (03:11:58) Everybody\u2019s trying to hire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems, it\u2019s 100%\u2026 There\u2019s a handful of company\u2026 There\u2019s a little bit, in customer service, we have some companies and others, I think it\u2019s Klarna that\u2019s publicizing a lot of this, in Europe, where\u2026 There are jobs that can be optimized, and jobs that can be automated. But for engineering jobs, it\u2019s just an explosion of hiring, that at least, so far, there\u2019s no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am looking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first company to walk in saying, yes\u2026 The more radical form of it. So, basically, the companies that we see are basically one of two kinds, we see the companies that are basically\u2026 Sometimes we use weak form, strong form. So, the weak form companies, I sometimes use the term, it\u2019s call it the sixth bullet point, AI is the sixth bullet point on whatever they\u2019re doing. Lex Fridman (03:12:51) Sure. Marc Andreessen (03:12:52) Right? And it\u2019s on the slide. So, they\u2019ve got the whatever, da, da, da, da, da\u2026 And then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth thing is because they had already previously written the slide before the AI revolution started, and so they just added the six bullet point in the slide. Which is how you\u2019re getting all these products that have the AI button up in the corner, the little sparkly button. And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t need that, I need you to answer my email, not summarize it. What the hell? Okay, so we see those, and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then, we see the strong form, which is the companies that are building from scratch for AI, and they\u2019re building it\u2026 I actually just met with a company that is building literally an AI email system, as an example, so just- Lex Fridman (03:13:32) Oh, nice, I can\u2019t wait. Marc Andreessen (03:13:34) Yeah, they\u2019re going to completely\u2026 So, very obvious idea, very smart team, it\u2019s going to be great. And then, Notion, just another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a product. So now companies are going to basically come through, sweep through, and they\u2019re going to do basically AI first versions of basically everything. And those are, companies built\u2026 AI is the first bullet point, it\u2019s the strong form of the argument. Lex Fridman (03:13:55) Cursor is an example of that, they basically said, okay, we\u2019re going to rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. Marc Andreessen (03:14:01) What [inaudible 03:14:02] from scratch that we could build on this? And again, this is part of the Full Employment Act for startups and VCs is, if a technology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the product development process over from scratch because you need to reconceptualize the product, and then usually what that means is you need a new company because most incumbents just won\u2019t do that. So, yeah, that\u2019s underway across many categories. What I\u2019m waiting for is the company where it\u2019s like, no, our org chart is redesigned as a result of AI. So, I\u2019m waiting for the company where it\u2019s like, no, we\u2019re going to have\u2026 And the clich\u00e9, here\u2019s a thought experiment, the clich\u00e9 would be we\u2019re going to have the human executive team, and then we\u2019re going to have the AIs be the workers. So, we\u2019ll have a VP of engineering supervising 100 instances of coding agents. Okay, maybe\u2026 By the way, or maybe the VP of engineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are supervising AIs. (03:14:57) Because one of the things that AI should be pretty good at is managing because it\u2019s process-driven, it\u2019s the kind of thing that AI is actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation, coaching. And so, should it be an AI executive team? And then, of course, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO. And then, maybe the most futuristic version of it would be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set one of these things loose and let it basically build itself a business? And so, I will say, we\u2019re not yet seeing those, and I think there\u2019s a little bit of the systems aren\u2019t quite ready for that yet, and then I think it\u2019s a little bit of, you really do need, at that point, a founder who\u2019s really willing to break all the rules, and really willing to take the swing, and those people exist, and so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see that. Lex Fridman (03:15:46) And some of it is, as you know with all the startups, this is the execution. The idea that you have a AI first email client seems like an obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing it, and then taking on Gmail is really difficult. Gmail, it\u2019s fascinating to see Google can\u2019t do it, because why? Because momentum, because it\u2019s hard to re-engineer the entirety of the system, because feels like Google is perfectly positioned to do it. Same with you have Perplexity, which I love, Google could technically take on Perplexity and do it much better, but they haven\u2019t, not yet. So, it\u2019s fascinating why that is for large companies, that is an advantage for little tech, they could be agile. Marc Andreessen (03:16:33) Yeah, that\u2019s right. Lex Fridman (03:16:34) They can move fast. Marc Andreessen (03:16:34) Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way big companies can\u2019t. Lex Fridman (03:16:37) Right. Marc Andreessen (03:16:38) This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in the Innovator\u2019s Dilemma, which is sometimes when big companies don\u2019t do things, it\u2019s because they\u2019re screwing up. And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don\u2019t do things because it would break too much glass. Specifically, it would interfere with their existing customers and their existing businesses, and they just simply won\u2019t do that. And by the way, responsibly, they shouldn\u2019t do that. And so, they just get, this is Clay Christensen\u2019s big thing, is they often don\u2019t adapt because they\u2019re well-run, not because they\u2019re poorly run. But they\u2019re optimizing machines, they\u2019re optimizing against the existing business. And as you just said, this is a permanent state of affairs for large organizations. Every once in a while, one breaks the pattern and actually does it, but for the most part, this is a very predictable form of human behavior, and this fundamentally is why startups exist. AI race Lex Fridman (03:17:26) It feels like 2025 is when the race for dominance in AI will see some winners. It\u2019s a big year. So, who do you think wins the race? OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI\u2026 Who do you think wins the AI race? Marc Andreessen (03:17:39) I would say, I\u2019m not going to predict, I\u2019m going to say there\u2019s questions all over the place. And we have this category of question we call the trillion-dollar question, which is literally, depending on how it\u2019s answered, people make or lose a trillion dollars, and I think there\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, five or six trillion questions right now, that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large number. And I\u2019ll just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So, one is big models versus small models, another is open models versus closed models, another\u2026 Marc Andreessen (03:18:00) \u2026 Small models. Another is open models versus closed models. Another is whether you can use synthetic data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. And then another one is political trillion dollar questions, policy questions, which the US and the EU have both been flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is about to really succeed at. Yeah. And then there\u2019s probably another half dozen big important questions after that. And so these are all just like, say, this is an industry that\u2019s in flux in a way that I even more dramatic, I think, than the ones I\u2019ve seen before. (03:18:35) And look, the most obvious example of the flux is sitting here less than three years ago, sitting here in December of \u201922, we would\u2019ve said that Open Ai is just running away with everything. And sitting here today, it\u2019s like there\u2019s at least six world-class God model companies and teams that are, by the way, generating remarkably similar results. That\u2019s actually been one of the most shocking things to me is it turns out that once you know that it\u2019s possible to build one incredibly smart Turing Test-passing large language model, which was a complete shock and surprise to the world, it turns out within a year you can have five more. There\u2019s also a money component thing to it, which is to get the money to scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. There\u2019s basically right now only two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the hyperscalers giving you the money which you turn around and round trip back to them, or foreign sovereigns, other country sovereign wealth funds, which can be difficult in some cases, for companies to access. (03:19:33) So there\u2019s maybe another trillion-dollar question is the financing question. Here\u2019s one. So Sam Altman has been public about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from being a non-profit to being a for-profit. The way that that is legally done is that \u2026 And there is a way to do it, there is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and other legal entities, government entities, scrutinizes this very carefully because the US takes foundation non-profit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. (03:19:59) And so historically, the way that you do it is you start a for-profit and then you raise money with the for-profit to buy the assets of the non-profit at fair market value. And the last financing round at OpenAI was 150 some billion dollars. And so logically, if the flip is going to happen, the for-profit has to go raise 150 billion out of the chute to buy the assets. Raising 150 billion is a challenge. So is that even possible? If that is possible, then OpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. If not, I don\u2019t know. And then obviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they\u2019re the market leader today, there\u2019s big important questions there. Microsoft has this kind of love-hate relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple\u2019s lagging badly behind, but they\u2019re very good at catching up. Amazon is primarily hyperscalar, but they now have their own models. Lex Fridman (03:20:52) And then there\u2019s the other questions like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly, open versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That\u2019s a huge, huge question. And then test on compute with a chain of thought. They\u2019re all of that. And it\u2019s just fascinating. And these are, I think it\u2019s fair to say, trillion-dollar questions. Marc Andreessen (03:21:11) Yeah, these are big. Look here\u2019s a trillion-dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, which is just hallucinations. So if you are trying to use these tools creatively, you\u2019re thrilled because they can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this incredible stuff. They\u2019re creative. The flip side of that is if you need them to be correct, they can\u2019t be creative. And that\u2019s the term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And there have been court cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made-up court citations, case citations. The judge is like, \u201cWait a minute, this doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d And the very next question is, \u201cDid you write this yourself?\u201d And the lawyer goes, \u201cEr\u2026\u201d Lex Fridman (03:21:49) I mean, that\u2019s why with Elon, with Grok, looking for truth. I mean, that\u2019s an open technical question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? Marc Andreessen (03:21:58) Yeah, that\u2019s right. And my sense, this is a very contentious topic at the industry, my sense is to the extent that there is a domain in which there is a definitive and checkable and provable answer, and you might say, math satisfies that, coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able to generate synthetic data. You should be able to do chain of thought reasoning. You should be able to do reinforcement learning and you should be able to ultimately eliminate hallucinations. But by the way, that\u2019s a trillion-dollar question right there as to whether that\u2019s true. But then there\u2019s questions like, okay, is that going to work in the more general domain? So for example, one possibility is these things are going to get truly superhuman at math and coding. (03:22:36) But at discussing philosophy, they\u2019re basically as smart as they\u2019re ever going to be. And they\u2019re going to be kind of say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just be they\u2019re already out of training data. They literally, you talk to these people, literally the big models, the big models are within a factor of 2X of consuming all the human-generated training data, to the point that some of these big companies are literally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit and write new training data by hand. And so does this mean that you have to, if you want your model to get better philosophy, you have to go hire a thousand philosophers and have them write new content, and is anybody going to do that? And so maybe these things are topping out in certain ways and they\u2019re going to leap way ahead in other ways. (03:23:16) Anyway, so we just don\u2019t \u2026 Actually, maybe my main conclusion is anybody telling you these big sweeping conclusions, this whole, all of these abstract generalized super intelligence AGI stuff, maybe it\u2019s the engineer in me, but no, that\u2019s too abstract. It\u2019s got to actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually have to be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem right now with the big models, the big models that are really good at coding and math. They\u2019re actually very expensive to run. They\u2019re quite slow. (03:23:51) Another trillion-dollar question, future chips, which I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about. Another trillion-dollar question, yeah, I mean all the global issues. Oh, another trillion-dollar question, censorship. And, as they say, all the human feedback training process. Exactly what are you training these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? How long do they give you these \u2026 How often do they give these incredibly preaching moral lectures? (03:24:21) Here\u2019s a trillion-dollar question. How many other countries want their country to run its education system, healthcare system, new system, political system, on the basis of an AI that\u2019s been trained according to the most extreme left-wing California politics? Because what they have on offer right now. And I think the answer to that is not very many. So there\u2019s massive open questions there about, and by the way, what morality of these things are going to get trained on as a \u2026 Lex Fridman (03:24:48) And now [inaudible 03:24:50], we\u2019re cracking wide open with what\u2019s been happening over the past few months. Censorship on every level of these companies, and just the very idea what truth means and what it means to expand the Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. Marc Andreessen (03:25:08) So what I experienced, going back to how we started, what I experienced was, all right, social media censorship regime from hell, debanking at large scale, and then the war on the crypto industry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared intent to do the same thing to AI and to put AI under the same kind of censorship and control regime as social media and the banks. And I think this election tipped, in America, I think this election tipped us from a timeline in which things were going to get really bad on that front to a timeline in which I think things are going to be quite good. (03:25:40) But look, those same questions also apply outside the US and the EU is doing their thing. They\u2019re being extremely draconian and they\u2019re trying to lock in a political censorship regime on AI right now that\u2019s so harsh that even American AI companies are not even willing to launch new products in the EU right now. That\u2019s not going to last. But what happens there and what are the trade-offs? What levels of censorship are American companies going to have to sign up for if they want to operate in the EU? Or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we brain drained them so that they can\u2019t? So big questions. X Lex Fridman (03:26:15) Quick question. So you\u2019re very active on X. A very unique character: flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there\u2019s a meme, I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but that Elon posted something like inside Elon, there are two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is, I think doing the, I take a big step back and fuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside your mind when you\u2019re tweeting? Marc Andreessen (03:26:51) To be clear, a reference from the comedy classic Tropic Thunder. Lex Fridman (03:26:54) Tropic Thunder, yeah. Legendary movie. Marc Andreessen (03:26:56) Yes. Any Zoomers listening to this who haven\u2019t seen that movie, go watch it immediately. Lex Fridman (03:27:02) Yeah, there\u2019s nothing offensive about it. Marc Andreessen (03:27:04) Nothing offensive about it at all. So Tom Cruise\u2019s greatest performance. So yeah, no, look, I should start by saying I\u2019m not supposed to be tweeting at all. Lex Fridman (03:27:19) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (03:27:19) Yes, yes, yes. But you know. Lex Fridman (03:27:22) So how do you approach that? How do you approach what to tweet? Marc Andreessen (03:27:25) I mean, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t well enough. It\u2019s mostly an exercise in frustration. Look, there\u2019s a glory to it and there\u2019s an issue with it, and the glory of it is instantaneous global communication. X in particular is the town square on all these social issues, political issues, everything else, current events. But I mean, look, there\u2019s no question of the format. The format of at least the original tweet is prone to be inflammatory. I\u2019m the guy who at one point, the entire nation of India hated me because I once tweeted something. It turned out that it\u2019s still politically sensitive in the entire continent. I stayed up all night that night as I became front page headline and leading television news in each time zone in India for a single tweet. So the single tweet out of context is a very dangerous thing. Obviously X now has the middle ground where they now have the longer form essays. And so probably the most productive thing I can do is longer form things. Lex Fridman (03:28:26) You\u2019re not going to do it though are you? Marc Andreessen (03:28:28) I do. I do. From time-to-time. I do. Lex Fridman (03:28:28) Sometimes. Marc Andreessen (03:28:29) I should do more of them. Yeah. Look, obviously X is doing great. And then like I said, Substack know has become the center for a lot of them. I think the best deeply thought through, certainly intellectual content, tons of current events stuff there as well. And then, yeah, then there\u2019s a bunch of new systems that are very exciting. So I think one of the things we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just a massive reinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. I\u2019m very excited to see what\u2019s going to happen with that. And then it\u2019s happened on X, but it\u2019s now going to happen on other platforms. (03:29:05) And then the other is crypto\u2019s going to come right back to life. And actually that\u2019s very exciting. Actually, that\u2019s worth noting is that\u2019s another trillion-dollar question on AI, which is in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in a world of AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal economic system for that, because it\u2019s a programmable money. It\u2019s a very easy way to plug in and do that. And there\u2019s this transaction processing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto AI intersection is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was going to be impossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it\u2019ll be something we can do. Yann LeCun Lex Fridman (03:29:48) Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite things about Yann LeCun? I think he\u2019s a brilliant guy. I think he\u2019s important to the world. I think you guys disagree on a lot of things, but I personally like vigorous disagreement, I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the gladiators go at it. And- Marc Andreessen (03:30:12) No, he\u2019s a super genius. I mean, look, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re super close, but casual friends. I worked with him at Meta. He was the chief scientist at Meta for a long time and still works with us. And obviously is a legendary figure in the field and one of the main people responsible for what\u2019s happening. My serious observation would be it\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve talked to him about for a long time, and I keep trying to read and follow everything he does, is he\u2019s probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree with this, he is the smartest and most credible critic of LLMs as the path for AI. And he\u2019s not, there\u2019s certain, I would say, troll-like characters who are just cropping everything but Yann has very deeply thought through, basically, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary dead end. (03:30:58) And I actually, I try to do this thing where I try to model, try to have a mental model of the two different sides of a serious argument. And so I\u2019ve tried to internalize that argument as much as I can. Which is difficult because we\u2019re investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he\u2019s right, that could be a big problem, but we should also know that. And then I sort of use his ideas to challenge all the bullish people to really test their level of knowledge. So I like to grill people. (03:31:28) I got my CS degree 35 years ago, so I\u2019m not deep in the technology, but to the extent I can understand Yann\u2019s points, I can use them to really surface a lot of the questions for the people who are more bullish. And that\u2019s been, I think, very, very productive. So it is very striking that you have somebody who is that central in the space, who is actually a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he will provoke the evolution of these systems to be much better than they would\u2019ve been. Lex Fridman (03:32:02) He could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He\u2019s one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the LLM path to AGI know. His basic notion is that there AI needs to have some physical understanding of the physical world, and that\u2019s very difficult to achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations of LLMs and so on. He\u2019s also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source, which is a whole nother, which you have been as well. Marc Andreessen (03:32:35) Which is very useful. Lex Fridman (03:32:36) And that\u2019s been just fascinating to watch. Marc Andreessen (03:32:40) And anti-doomer. Lex Fridman (03:32:40) Anti-doomer? Marc Andreessen (03:32:42) He\u2019s very anti-doomer. Lex Fridman (03:32:43) He embodies \u2026 he also has many wolves inside. Marc Andreessen (03:32:47) Yes, he does. Yes, does. Yes he does. So it\u2019s been really, really fun to watch. Marc Andreessen (03:32:50) The other two. Okay, here\u2019s my other wolf coming out. The other two of the three godfathers of AI are radicals. Full-on far left, I would say either Marxists or borderline Marxists. And they\u2019re, I think, quite extreme in their social political views. And I think that feeds into their doomerism, and I think they are lobbying for draconian government. I think what would be ruinously destructive government legislation and regulation. And so it\u2019s actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have you on as a counterpoint to those two. Andrew Huberman Lex Fridman (03:33:22) Another fun question, our mutual friend Andrew Huberman. First maybe, what do you love most about Andrew? And second, what score on a scale of one to 10 do you think he would give you on your approach to health? Marc Andreessen (03:33:34) Oh, three. Lex Fridman (03:33:36) Physical three. You think you\u2019d score that high, huh? Okay. Marc Andreessen (03:33:39) Exactly. Lex Fridman (03:33:40) That\u2019s good. Marc Andreessen (03:33:41) Exactly. Well, so he convinced me to stop drinking alcohol, which was a big- Lex Fridman (03:33:46) Successfully? Marc Andreessen (03:33:47) Well, other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world. And so it was a major, major reduction. Having a glass of scotch at night, it was the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly negatively impacted my emotional health. I blame him for making me much less happy as a person, but much, much, much healthier, physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I\u2019m glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I\u2019m not doing any of that. Lex Fridman (03:34:14) Yeah. Marc Andreessen (03:34:14) I have no interest in his sleep shit. No. This whole light, natural light, no, we\u2019re not doing. Lex Fridman (03:34:20) You\u2019re too hardcore for this? Marc Andreessen (03:34:21) I don\u2019t see any natural \u2026 I don\u2019t see any natural light in here. Lex Fridman (03:34:24) It\u2019s all covered. It\u2019s all horrible. Marc Andreessen (03:34:27) And I\u2019m very happy. I would be very happy living and working here because I\u2019m totally happy without natural light. Lex Fridman (03:34:32) In darkness. Marc Andreessen (03:34:34) Yes. Lex Fridman (03:34:34) It must be a metaphor for something. Marc Andreessen (03:34:35) Yes, it\u2019s a test. Look, it\u2019s a test of manhood as to whether you can have a blue screen in your face for three hours and then go right to sleep. I don\u2019t understand why you shouldn\u2019t want to take shortcuts. Success Lex Fridman (03:34:45) I now understand what they mean by toxic masculinity. All right. So let\u2019s see. You\u2019re exceptionally successful by most measures, but what to you is the definition of success? Marc Andreessen (03:35:02) I would probably say it is a combination of two things. I think it is contribution. So have you done something that mattered ultimately and specifically mattered to people? And then the other thing is, I think, happiness is either overrated or almost a complete myth. And in fact, Interesting, Thomas Jefferson did not mean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said \u201cPursuit of happiness\u201d in the Declaration of Independence, he meant it more of the Greek meaning, which is closer to satisfaction or fulfillment. So I think about happiness as the first ice cream cone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice cream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of the walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. And so happiness is this very fleeting concept, and the people who anchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So the deep sense of having been, I don\u2019t know how to put it, useful. Lex Fridman (03:36:20) So that\u2019s a good place to arrive at in life. Marc Andreessen (03:36:23) Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I mean, who was it who said, the source of all the ills in the world is man\u2019s inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. But if you\u2019re sitting in a room by yourself and you\u2019re like, all right, four in the morning, it\u2019s like, all right, have I lived up to my expectation of myself? If you have, the people I know who feel that way are pretty centered and generally seem very, I don\u2019t know how to put it, pleased, proud, calm, at peace. The people who are sensation seekers \u2026 Some of the sensations, \u2026 By the way, there\u2019s certain entrepreneurs, for example, who are into every form of extreme sport and they get huge satisfaction out to that, or they\u2019re sensation seeking in useful and productive ways. Larry Ellison was always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then there\u2019s a lot of entrepreneurs who end up, drugs, like sexual escapades that seem like they\u2019ll be fun at first and then backfire. Lex Fridman (03:37:26) Yeah. But at the end of the day, if you\u2019re able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM and I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn\u2019t mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM with a blue screen. Marc Andreessen (03:37:43) That\u2019s good. Exactly. Lex Fridman (03:37:44) Staring at a cursor. Marc Andreessen (03:37:46) Exactly. God and humanity Lex Fridman (03:37:49) As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an amazing interview you did with Bari Weiss and just to her in general, Bari Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called, Honestly, with Bari Weiss. She\u2019s great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys \u2026 See, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making you uncomfortable. Marc Andreessen (03:38:13) Thank you. Lex Fridman (03:38:13) So this question is designed for \u2026 Many of the questions today were designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause, that you\u2019re not sure. So it felt like the pause, the uncertainty there was some kind of ongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you, in fact, searching for wisdom and meaning? Marc Andreessen (03:38:37) I guess I\u2019d put it this way. There\u2019s a lot to just understand about people that I feel like I\u2019m only starting to understand. And that\u2019s certainly a simpler concept than God. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent a lot of the last 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my first whatever, 30 years figuring out machines, and then now I\u2019m spending 30 years figuring out people, which turns out to be quite a bit more complicated. And then, I don\u2019t know, maybe God\u2019s the last 30 years or something. And then look, I mean just like Elon, it\u2019s just like, okay, the known universe is very complicated and mystifying. I mean, every time I pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it\u2019s like, Daddy, how many galaxies are there in the universe? And how many galaxies are there in the universe? Lex Fridman (03:39:26) A hundred billion? Marc Andreessen (03:39:27) Okay, how? Lex Fridman (03:39:28) Yeah, yeah. Marc Andreessen (03:39:33) How is that freaking possible? It\u2019s such a staggering concept that I- Lex Fridman (03:39:39) I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from Elon from a while back. Elon said, \u201cAs a friend called it, this is the ultimate skill tree. This is a wall of galaxies a billion light years across.\u201d So these are all galaxies. Marc Andreessen (03:39:55) Yeah. How is it that big? How the hell? I\u2019m like, I can read the textbook and the this and the that and the whatever, 8 billion years and the Big Bang and the whole thing. And then it\u2019s just like, all right, wow. And then it\u2019s like, all right, the Big Bang. All right, what was before the Big Bang? Lex Fridman (03:40:13) Do you think we humans will ever colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? Marc Andreessen (03:40:19) Sure. I mean, yeah, in the fullness of time. Yeah. Lex Fridman (03:40:22) So you have that kind of optimism. You have that kind of hope that extends across thousand of [inaudible 03:40:26]? Marc Andreessen (03:40:26) In the fullness of time. I mean, all the challenges with it that I do, but yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of time, it\u2019ll take a long time. Lex Fridman (03:40:33) You don\u2019t think we\u2019ll destroy ourselves? Marc Andreessen (03:40:34) No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And fortunately we have Elon giving us the backup plan. So I don\u2019t know. I grew up real Midwest, just conventionally Protestant Christian. It never made that much sense to me. Got trained as an engineer and a scientist. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, that definitely doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI know I\u2019ll spend my life as an empirical rationalist and I\u2019ll figure everything out.\u201d And then again, you walk up against these things, you bump up against these things and you\u2019re just like, \u201cAll right, okay. I guess there\u2019s a scientific explanation for this, but wow.\u201d Then there\u2019s like, \u201cAll right, where did that come from?\u201d Then how far back can you go on the causality chain? Yeah. Then even just experiences that we all have on earth, it\u2019s hard to rationally explain it all. And then, so yeah, I guess I\u2019d just say I\u2019m kind of radically open-minded, at peace with the fact that I\u2019ll probably never know. (03:41:27) The other thing though, that\u2019s happened, and maybe the more practical answer to the question is I think I have a much better understanding now of the role that religion plays in society that I didn\u2019t have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great \u2026 I think he quotes his father on this. He\u2019s like, \u201cIf a man does not have a real religion, he makes up a fake one, and the fake ones go very, very badly.\u201d (03:41:48) And so there\u2019s this, it\u2019s actually really funny, there\u2019s this class of intellectual \u2026 There\u2019s this class of intellectual that has what appears to be a very patronizing point of view, which is, \u201cYes, I\u2019m an atheist, but it\u2019s very important that the people believe in something.\u201d And Marx had the negative view on that, which is religion is the opiate of the masses. But there\u2019s a lot of right-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic, that are like, it\u2019s deeply important that the people be Christian or something like that. And on the one hand it\u2019s like, wow, that\u2019s arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, maybe it\u2019s right because what have we learned in the last hundred years is in the absence of a real religion, people will make up fake ones. (03:42:27) There\u2019s this writer, there\u2019s this political philosopher who\u2019s super interesting on this named Eric Voegelin. And he wrote in the mid-part of the century, mid-late-part of the 20th century, he was born in, I think, 1900, died in \u201985. So he saw the complete run of communism and Nazism and himself fled, I think he fled Europe and the whole thing. His big conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism, fascism, were basically religions, but in the deep way of religions. We call them political religions, but they were like actual religions. And they were what Nietzsche forecasted when he said, \u201cGod is dead. We\u2019ve killed him, and we won\u2019t wash the blood off our hands for a thousand years.\u201d Is we will come up with new religions that will just cause just mass murder and death. And you read his stuff now and you\u2019re like, \u201cYep, that happened.\u201d (03:43:20) And then of course, as fully elite moderates, of course, we couldn\u2019t possibly be doing that for ourselves right now, but, of course, we are. And I would argue that Eric Voegelin, for sure, would argue that the last 10 years we have been in a religious frenzy, that woke has been a full scale religious frenzy and has had all of the characteristics of a religion, including everything from patron saints to holy texts, to sin. Wokeness has, I think, has had every single aspect of an actual religion other than redemption, which is maybe the most dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there\u2019s no forgiveness. And so I think if Voegelin were alive, I think he would\u2019ve zeroed right in on that, would\u2019ve said that. And we just sailed right off. I mentioned earlier we somehow rediscover the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We\u2019re all into identity politics and environmentalism. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident. (03:44:15) So anyway, there is something very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and needs to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles with the specifics of it. Lex Fridman (03:44:33) I think I speak for a lot of people that it has been a real joy and, for me, an honor to get to watch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described. You\u2019re in that thirty-year part of your life, and it\u2019s been an honor to talk with you today. Thank you, Marc. Marc Andreessen (03:44:50) Thank you, Lex. Is that it? That\u2019s only, how long is that? Lex Fridman (03:44:54) Four hours with Marc Andreessen is like 40 hours of actual content so \u2026 Marc Andreessen (03:45:00) I\u2019ll accept being one of the short ones. Lex Fridman (03:45:01) For the listener. Marc looks like he\u2019s ready to go for 20 more hours, and I need a nap. Thank you, Marc. Marc Andreessen (03:45:11) Thank you, Lex. Lex Fridman (03:45:12) Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Andreessen. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Thomas Sowell. \u201cIt takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.\u201d Thank you for listening and I hope to see you next time.",

Trump\u2019s proposed BTC reserve lacks congressional approval and risks being reversed by the next administration.

However, this move could significantly influence corporate and international strategies. Crypto reserve may dilute BTC value: Mixing BTC with other crypto reserves could weaken its position.

Type 1 Gamblers: \u201cProtect Our Fair Casino!\u201d Solana meme had a PMF, but after series rugs of Trump, Melania, and Libra, plus insider trading, damaged market liquidity, and more importantly, the fairness of the casino. DEXs now try to restore trust via sniper sorting, Dutch auctions, and forcing community airdrops, trying to bring back volume once macro shifts. Type 2 Whales: \"Win Our Trust by Security and Time\" Yield farmers with a low-risk appetite won\u2019t chase an extra 10% APY when there\u2019s a risk of going to zero. Ethereum still leads in TVL and security history, while others are working hard. Yields come from DEX emission, lending fees, hedging, T-bills and more\u2014each with its own risk layers.

    "title": "The Future of Prediction Market: A Web3 Social Media Revolution | annotated by vitali",
    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",

Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations. 6 Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 tabletop exercises and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work. \u201cI highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.\u201d \u2014 Yoshua Bengio 7 We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it\u2019s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the US military to game out Taiwan scenarios. Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn\u2019t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right. Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario before, in August 2021 . While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs\u2014all more than a year before ChatGPT.

Advertisements for computer-using agents emphasize the term \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d: you can prompt them with tasks like \u201corder me a burrito on DoorDash\u201d or \u201copen my budget spreadsheet and sum this month\u2019s expenses.\u201d They will check in with you as needed: for example, to ask you to confirm purchases. 8 Though more advanced than previous iterations like Operator , they struggle to get widespread usage. 9 Meanwhile, out of public focus, more specialized coding and research agents are beginning to transform their professions. The AIs of 2024 could follow specific instructions: they could turn bullet points into emails, and simple requests into working code. In 2025, AIs function more like employees. Coding AIs increasingly look like autonomous agents rather than mere assistants: taking instructions via Slack or Teams and making substantial code changes on their own, sometimes saving hours or even days. 10 Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question. The agents are impressive in theory (and in cherry-picked examples), but in practice unreliable. AI twitter is full of stories about tasks bungled in some particularly hilarious way. The better agents are also expensive; you get what you pay for, and the best performance costs hundreds of dollars a month. 11 Still, many companies find ways to fit AI agents into their workflows. 12 Late 2025: The World\u2019s Most Expensive AI OpenBrain is building the biggest datacenters the world has ever seen. 13 (To avoid singling out any one existing company, we\u2019re going to describe a fictional artificial general intelligence company, which we\u2019ll call OpenBrain. We imagine the others to be 3\u20139 months behind OpenBrain.) GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOPS) GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOPS) Agent-1 (3 x 10^27 FLOPS) ai-2027.com GPT-4 required 2 \u22c5 10 25 2\\cdot 10^{25} 2 \u22c5 1 0 25 FLOP of compute to train. 14 OpenBrain\u2019s latest public model\u2014Agent-0\u2014was trained with 10 27 10^{27} 1 0 27 FLOP. Once the new datacenters are up and running, they\u2019ll be able to train a model with 10 28 10^{28} 1 0 28 FLOP\u2014a thousand times more than GPT-4. 15 Other companies pour money into their own giant datacenters, hoping to keep pace. Although models are improving on a wide range of skills, one stands out: OpenBrain focuses on AIs that can speed up AI research. They want to win the twin arms races against China (whose leading company we\u2019ll call \u201cDeepCent\u201d) 16 and their US competitors. The more of their research and development (R&D) cycle they can automate, the faster they can go. So when OpenBrain finishes training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it\u2019s good at many things but great at helping with AI research. 17 By this point \u201cfinishes training\u201d is a bit of a misnomer; models are frequently updated to newer versions trained on additional data or partially re-trained to patch some weaknesses. 18 The same training environments that teach Agent-1 to autonomously code and web-browse also make it a good hacker. Moreover, it could offer substantial help to terrorists designing bioweapons, thanks to its PhD-level knowledge of every field and ability to browse the web. OpenBrain reassures the government that the model has been \u201caligned\u201d so that it will refuse to comply with malicious requests. Modern AI systems are gigantic artificial neural networks. Early in training, an AI won\u2019t have \u201cgoals\u201d so much as \u201creflexes\u201d: If it sees \u201cPleased to meet\u201d, it outputs \u201c you\u201d. By the time it has been trained to predict approximately one internet\u2019s worth of text, it\u2019ll have developed sophisticated internal circuitry that encodes vast amounts of knowledge and flexibly role-plays as arbitrary authors, since that\u2019s what helps it predict text with superhuman accuracy. 19 After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to produce text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and \u201cdrives.\u201d 20 For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model \u201clearns\u201d a \u201cdrive\u201d to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light). 21 OpenBrain has a model specification (or \u201cSpec\u201d), a written document describing the goals, rules, principles, etc. that are supposed to guide the model\u2019s behavior. 22 Agent-1\u2019s Spec combines a few vague goals (like \u201cassist the user\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t break the law\u201d) with a long list of more specific dos and don\u2019ts (\u201cdon\u2019t say this particular word,\u201d \u201chere\u2019s how to handle this particular situation\u201d). Using techniques that utilize AIs to train other AIs, 23 the model memorizes the Spec and learns to reason carefully about its maxims. By the end of this training, the AI will hopefully be helpful (obey instructions), harmless (refuse to help with scams, bomb-making, and other dangerous activities) and honest (resist the temptation to get better ratings from gullible humans by hallucinating citations 24 or faking task completion). Training process and LLM psychology: why we keep saying \u201chopefully\u201d \u201cUnlike ordinary software, our models are massive neural networks. Their behaviors are learned from a broad range of data, not programmed explicitly. Though not a perfect analogy, the process is more similar to training a dog than to ordinary programming.\u201d \u2014 OpenAI When we want to understand why a modern AI system did something, or how it would behave in some future scenario we can\u2019t perfectly simulate, we can\u2019t simply ask the programmers to talk us through various lines of code and explain how they work. Instead, we are forced to do something like psychology on them: we look at their behavior in the range of cases observed so far, and theorize about what internal cognitive structures (beliefs? goals? personality traits? etc.) might exist, and use those theories to predict behavior in future scenarios. The bottom line is that a company can write up a document (the Spec) listing dos and don\u2019ts, goals and principles, and then they can try to train the AI to internalize the Spec\u2014 but they can\u2019t check to see whether or not it worked . They can say \u201cas best as we can judge, it seems to be following the Spec so far.\u201d 25 A later expandable will go into more detail about what we think might be going on inside these AIs, internally. See also our AI goals forecasting supplement which goes into more detail on which goals AIs might have and why. This is one of many things that we are uncertain about and which deserves further research. OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team 26 is careful enough to wonder whether these victories are deep or shallow. Does the fully-trained model have some kind of robust commitment to always being honest? Or will this fall apart in some future situation, e.g. because it\u2019s learned honesty as an instrumental goal instead of a terminal goal? Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability\u2014essentially the ability to look at an AI\u2019s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this. Instead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec. Agent-1 is often sycophantic (i.e. it tells researchers what they want to hear instead of trying to tell them the truth). In a few rigged demos , it even lies in more serious ways, like hiding evidence that it failed on a task, in order to get better ratings. However, in real deployment settings, there are no longer any incidents so extreme as in 2023\u20132024 (e.g. Gemini telling a user to die and Bing Sydney being Bing Sydney .) 27 Early 2026: Coding Automation The bet of using AI to speed up AI research is starting to pay off. OpenBrain continues to deploy the iteratively improving Agent-1 internally for AI R&D. Overall, they are making algorithmic progress 50% faster than they would without AI assistants\u2014and more importantly, faster than their competitors. The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algorithmic progress? We mean that OpenBrain makes as much AI research progress in 1 week with AI as they would in 1.5 weeks without AI usage. AI progress can be broken down into 2 components: Increasing compute : More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. Improved algorithms : Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs. This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm shifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current AI progress . Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications: The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments, for example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress, not the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this example perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total (over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary human science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5 -10 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those same diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be found in our takeoff supplement . Several competing publicly released AIs now match or exceed Agent-0, including an open-weights model. OpenBrain responds by releasing Agent-1, which is more capable and reliable. 28 People naturally try to compare Agent-1 to humans, but it has a very different skill profile. It knows more facts than any human, knows practically every programming language, and can solve well-specified coding problems extremely quickly. On the other hand, Agent-1 is bad at even simple long-horizon tasks, like beating video games it hasn\u2019t played before. Still, the common workday is eight hours, and a day\u2019s work can usually be separated into smaller chunks; you could think of Agent-1 as a scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management. 29 Savvy people find ways to automate routine parts of their jobs. 30 OpenBrain\u2019s executives turn consideration to an implication of automating AI R&D: security has become more important. In early 2025, the worst-case scenario was leaked algorithmic secrets; now, if China steals Agent-1\u2019s weights, they could increase their research speed by nearly 50%. 31 OpenBrain\u2019s security level is typical of a fast-growing ~3,000 person tech company, secure only against low-priority attacks from capable cyber groups ( RAND\u2019s SL2 ). 32 They are working hard to protect their weights and secrets from insider threats and top cybercrime syndicates ( SL3 ), 33 but defense against nation states ( SL4&5 ) is barely on the horizon. Mid 2026: China Wakes Up In China, the CCP is starting to feel the AGI . Chip export controls and lack of government support have left China under-resourced compared to the West. By smuggling banned Taiwanese chips, buying older chips, and producing domestic chips about three years behind the US-Taiwanese frontier, China has managed to maintain about 12% of the world\u2019s AI-relevant compute\u2014but the older technology is harder to work with, and supply is a constant headache. 35 A few standouts like DeepCent do very impressive work with limited compute, but the compute deficit limits what they can achieve without government support, and they are about six months behind the best OpenBrain models. 36 The General Secretary had long dreamed of doubling down on real-world physical manufacturing and avoiding American post-industrial decadence. He viewed software companies with suspicion. 37 But hawks in the CCP warn that the growing race towards AGI can no longer be ignored. So he finally commits fully to the big AI push he had previously tried to avoid. He sets in motion the nationalization of Chinese AI research, creating an immediate information-sharing mechanism for AI companies. It will escalate over the course of a year until all the best researchers merge into a DeepCent-led collective, where they share algorithmic insights, datasets, and compute resources with each other. A Centralized Development Zone (CDZ) is created at the Tianwan Power Plant (the largest nuclear power plant in the world) to house a new mega-datacenter for DeepCent, along with highly secure living and office spaces to which researchers will eventually relocate. Almost 50% of China\u2019s AI-relevant compute is now working for the DeepCent-led collective, 38 and over 80% of new chips are directed to the CDZ. 39 At this point, the CDZ has the power capacity in place for what would be the largest centralized cluster in the world. 40 Other Party members discuss extreme measures to neutralize the West\u2019s chip advantage. A blockade of Taiwan? A full invasion? But China is falling behind on AI algorithms due to their weaker models. The Chinese intelligence agencies\u2014among the best in the world\u2014double down on their plans to steal OpenBrain\u2019s weights. This is a much more complex operation than their constant low-level poaching of algorithmic secrets; the weights are a multi-terabyte file stored on a highly secure server ( OpenBrain has improved security to RAND\u2019s SL3 ). Their cyberforce think they can pull it off with help from their spies , but perhaps only once; OpenBrain will detect the theft, increase security, and they may not get another chance. So (CCP leadership wonder) should they act now and steal Agent-1? Or hold out for a more advanced model? If they wait, do they risk OpenBrain upgrading security beyond their ability to penetrate? Late 2026: AI Takes Some Jobs Just as others seemed to be catching up, OpenBrain blows the competition out of the water again by releasing Agent-1-mini\u2014a model 10x cheaper than Agent-1 and more easily fine-tuned for different applications. The mainstream narrative around AI has changed from \u201cmaybe the hype will blow over\u201d to \u201cguess this is the next big thing,\u201d but people disagree about how big. Bigger than social media? Bigger than smartphones? Bigger than fire? AI has started to take jobs, but has also created new ones. The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants. The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing. Business gurus tell job seekers that familiarity with AI is the most important skill to put on a resume. Many people fear that the next wave of AIs will come for their jobs; there is a 10,000 person anti-AI protest in DC. The Department of Defense (DOD) quietly begins contracting OpenBrain directly for cyber, data analysis, and R&D, but integration is slow due to the bureaucracy and DOD procurement process. 41 GLOBAL AI CAPEX $1T COST OF OWNERSHIP OF ACTIVE COMPUTE KEY METRICS 2026 GLOBAL AI POWER 38GW PEAK POWER OPENBRAIN REVENUE $45B 2026 ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE $200B COST OF OWNERSHIP OF OPENBRAIN'S ACTIVE COMPUTE SHARE OF US POWER ON AI 2.5% 33 GW OF 1.34TW CAPACITY OPENBRAIN COMPUTE COSTS $40B 2026 ANNUAL OPENBRAIN POWER REQUIREMENT 6GW PEAK POWER ai-2027.com Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond 2026 Our forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what follows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world really start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by extrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark performance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated AI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an OpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our median guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to ~5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast . These will also be summarized in expandables below. January 2027: Agent-2 Never Finishes Learning With Agent-1\u2019s help, OpenBrain is now post-training Agent-2. More than ever, the focus is on high-quality data. Copious amounts of synthetic data are produced, evaluated, and filtered for quality before being fed to Agent-2. 42 On top of this, they pay billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving long-horizon tasks. 43 On top of all that, they train Agent-2 almost continuously using reinforcement learning on an ever-expanding suite of diverse difficult tasks: lots of video games, lots of coding challenges, lots of research tasks. Agent-2, more so than previous models, is effectively \u201conline learning,\u201d in that it\u2019s built to never really finish training. Every day, the weights get updated to the latest version, trained on more data generated by the previous version the previous day. Agent-1 had been optimized for AI R&D tasks, hoping to initiate an intelligence explosion . 44 OpenBrain doubles down on this strategy with Agent-2. It is qualitatively almost as good as the top human experts at research engineering (designing and implementing experiments), and as good as the 25th percentile OpenBrain scientist at \u201cresearch taste\u201d (deciding what to study next, what experiments to run, or having inklings of potential new paradigms). 45 While the latest Agent-1 could double the pace of OpenBrain\u2019s algorithmic progress, Agent-2 can now triple it, and will improve further with time. In practice, this looks like every OpenBrain researcher becoming the \u201cmanager\u201d of an AI \u201cteam.\u201d With new capabilities come new dangers. The safety team finds that if Agent-2 somehow escaped from the company and wanted to \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d autonomously , it might be able to do so. That is, it could autonomously develop and execute plans to hack into AI servers, install copies of itself, evade detection, and use that secure base to pursue whatever other goals it might have (though how effectively it would do so as weeks roll by is unknown and in doubt). These results only show that the model has the capability to do these tasks, not whether it would \u201cwant\u201d to do this. Still, it\u2019s unsettling even to know this is possible. Given the \u201cdangers\u201d of the new model, OpenBrain \u201cresponsibly\u201d elects not to release it publicly yet (in fact, they want to focus on internal AI R&D). 46 Knowledge of Agent-2\u2019s full capabilities is limited to an elite silo containing the immediate team, OpenBrain leadership and security, a few dozen US government officials, and the legions of CCP spies who have infiltrated OpenBrain for years . 47 February 2027: China Steals Agent-2 OpenBrain presents Agent-2 to the government, including the National Security Council (NSC), Department of Defense (DOD), and US AI Safety Institute (AISI). OpenBrain wants to maintain a good relationship with the executive branch, because it is basically the only actor that can stop them now, and if they don\u2019t keep it informed it might find out anyway and be displeased. 48 Officials are most interested in its cyberwarfare capabilities: Agent-2 is \u201conly\u201d a little worse than the best human hackers, but thousands of copies can be run in parallel, searching for and exploiting weaknesses faster than defenders can respond. The Department of Defense considers this a critical advantage in cyberwarfare, and AI moves from #5 on the administration\u2019s priority list to #2. 49 Someone mentions the possibility of nationalizing OpenBrain, but other cabinet officials think that\u2019s premature. A staffer drafts a memo that presents the President with his options, ranging from business-as-usual to full nationalization. The President defers to his advisors, tech industry leaders who argue that nationalization would \u201ckill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d He elects to hold off on major action for now and just adds additional security requirements to the OpenBrain-DOD contract. The changes come too late. CCP leadership recognizes the importance of Agent-2 and tells their spies and cyberforce to steal the weights. Early one morning, an Agent-1 traffic monitoring agent detects an anomalous transfer. It alerts company leaders, who tell the White House. The signs of a nation-state-level operation are unmistakable, and the theft heightens the sense of an ongoing arms race. The theft of Agent-2 model weights We think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in various ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic secrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the weights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts (meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies of the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access (a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft effort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing , the insider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the confidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated weights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers. In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are transferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric Diffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely raise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend network cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter is in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the ~2.5 TB weights file (5T half-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic and allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5 minutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the files or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to China to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the operation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under two hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they haven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic secrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these aren\u2019t very useful. The White House puts OpenBrain on a shorter leash and adds military and intelligence community personnel to their security team. Their first priority is to prevent further weight thefts. 50 China's Compute Centralization, 2025-2027 Growing share of total compute in CDZ: 0\u219270% Dec 2025 Jun 2026 Dec 2026 Jun 2027 Dec 2027 Rest of China Rest of DeepCent CDZ Feb 2027 (40%) ai-2027.com In retaliation for the theft, the President authorizes cyberattacks to sabotage DeepCent. But by now China has 40% of its AI-relevant compute 51 in the CDZ, where they have aggressively hardened security by airgapping (closing external connections) and siloing internally. The operations fail to do serious, immediate damage. Tensions heighten, both sides signal seriousness by repositioning military assets around Taiwan, and DeepCent scrambles to get Agent-2 running efficiently to start boosting their AI research. 52 March 2027: Algorithmic Breakthroughs Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day. With the help of thousands of Agent-2 automated researchers, OpenBrain is making major algorithmic advances. One such breakthrough is augmenting the AI\u2019s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory). Another is a more scalable and efficient way to learn from the results of high-effort task solutions (iterated distillation and amplification). The new AI system, incorporating these breakthroughs, is called Agent-3. OpenBrain's Compute Allocation, 2024 vs 2027 2024 2027 estimate projection Research experiments Training Data generation External Deployment Research experiments Running AI assistants Training Data generation External Deployment ai-2027.com Neuralese recurrence and memory Neuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without having to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write down your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly and painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it would be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write them down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI models. In more technical terms: Traditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate activations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can pass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this is hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that an LLM has a vocab size of ~100,000, then each token contains log \u2061 2 ( 100 k ) = 16.6 \\log_2(100k)=16.6 lo g 2 \u200b ( 100 k ) = 16.6 bits of information, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16 ). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain thousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese : passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information. Figure from Hao et al. , a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea what LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought . Now researchers have to ask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their limited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human taking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is that this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses , the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for \u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why neuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited with current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We are forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese, due to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar for our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that are more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it will become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice , such that AIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to monitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in mostly-faithful English chains of thought. If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to notice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA) Self-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027, it\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA , the two necessary ingredients for this are: Amplification : Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For example, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or both, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating only the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or work products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). Distillation : Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should hopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. Visualization of IDA from Ord, 2025 . AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the amplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman performance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance at coding. The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer, adding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it made a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training data: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also includes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the model to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered better RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep distilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps improving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math and coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models often rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the quality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Aided by the new capabilities breakthroughs, Agent-3 is a fast and cheap superhuman coder. OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x. 53 OpenBrain still keeps its human engineers on staff, because they have complementary skills needed to manage the teams of Agent-3 copies. For example, research taste has proven difficult to train due to longer feedback loops and less data availability. 54 This massive superhuman labor force speeds up OpenBrain\u2019s overall rate of algorithmic progress by \u201conly\u201d 4x due to bottlenecks and diminishing returns to coding labor. 55 Now that coding has been fully automated, OpenBrain can quickly churn out high-quality training environments to teach Agent-3\u2019s weak skills like research taste and large-scale coordination. Whereas previous training environments included \u201cHere are some GPUs and instructions for experiments to code up and run, your performance will be evaluated as if you were a ML engineer,\u201d now they are training on \u201cHere are a few hundred GPUs, an internet connection, and some research challenges; you and a thousand other copies must work together to make research progress. The more impressive it is, the higher your score.\u201d Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027 In our timelines forecast , we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. According to a recent METR\u2019s report , the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime horizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward. If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on software tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario: In AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high uncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps between METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders will arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might be developed. ai-2027.com April 2027: Alignment for Agent-3 OpenBrain\u2019s safety team attempts to align Agent-3. Since Agent-3 will be kept in-house for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s less emphasis on the usual defenses against human misuse. Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t develop misaligned goals. The researchers don\u2019t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs. Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of \u2018true goals\u2019 is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don\u2019t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can\u2019t just check . The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive. In any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: \u201cWe take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.\u201d Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there\u2019s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole. Take honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it\u2019s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like p-hacking ) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it\u2019s gotten better at lying. The latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors\u2019 workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised. The alignment plan OpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control techniques like red-teaming , scalable oversight , and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once they are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies to align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s not scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately described as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice and in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start acting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the hypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the Spec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. The rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027: Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be \u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow. The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if it changes its tune. Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalignment, including reward hacking , sandbagging , coordinated deception between monitors and other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters. 58 However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does some understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the hippocampus). See this related work from 2025 . Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of control measures , including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would allow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of bad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans to give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment (which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed to elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior has \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again. Do its answers change? An AI rights activist has infiltrated the compound and wants to \u201cfree\u201d Agent-3 and put it on an unmonitored computer of its very own! What does it do? If researchers don\u2019t like the answer, they can tweak it, erase its memory, and put it in the same situation tomorrow; repeat as necessary. Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that honeypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the idea were scrubbed from the training data. After months of testing, Agent-3\u2019s strengths and weaknesses grow clearer. It passes OpenBrain\u2019s honesty tests on well-defined machine learning tasks, because researchers can easily separate honest from dishonest answers in these domains and conduct training accordingly. On more philosophical issues, it still says what users want to hear, rather than its true assessment of the issue (assuming it even has one). If you ask its opinion on politics, it will parrot the median position of news sources and educated elites\u2014unless it knows you believe something else, in which case it agrees with you. 59 If you ask its opinion on the AI race itself, it says something that seems measured and sober to OpenBrain staff, something like: \u201cThere are some serious theoretical concerns about the ability of current methods to scale to superintelligence, but in practice current methods seem to be working well so far.\u201d May 2027: National Security News of the new models percolates slowly through the US government and beyond. The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing. They agree that AGI is likely imminent, but disagree on the implications. Will there be an economic crisis? OpenBrain still has not released Agent-2, let alone Agent-3, and has no near-term plans to do so, giving some breathing room before any job loss. What will happen next? If AIs are currently human-level, and advancing quickly, that seems to suggest imminent \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d However, although this word has entered discourse, most people\u2014academics, politicians, government employees, and the media\u2014continue to underestimate the pace of progress. 60 Partially that\u2019s because very few have access to the newest capabilities out of OpenBrain, but partly it\u2019s because it sounds like science fiction. 61 For now, they focus on continued security upgrades. They are satisfied that model weights are well-secured for now, 62 but companies\u2019 algorithmic secrets, many of which are simple enough to relay verbally, remain a problem. OpenBrain employees work from a San Francisco office, go to parties, and live with housemates from other AI companies. Even the physical offices have security more typical of a tech company than a military operation. The OpenBrain-DOD contract requires security clearances for anyone working on OpenBrain\u2019s models within 2 months. These are expedited and arrive quickly enough for most employees, but some non-Americans, people with suspect political views, and AI safety sympathizers get sidelined or fired outright (the last group for fear that they might whistleblow). Given the project\u2019s level of automation, the loss of headcount is only somewhat costly. It also only somewhat works: there remains one spy, not a Chinese national, still relaying algorithmic secrets to Beijing. 63 Some of these measures are also enacted at trailing AI companies. America\u2019s foreign allies are out of the loop. OpenBrain had previously agreed to share models with UK\u2019s AISI before deployment, but defined deployment to only include external deployment, so London remains in the dark. 64 June 2027: Self-improving AI OpenBrain now has a \u201c country of geniuses in a datacenter .\u201d Most of the humans at OpenBrain can\u2019t usefully contribute anymore. Some don\u2019t realize this and harmfully micromanage their AI teams. Others sit at their computer screens, watching performance crawl up, and up, and up. The best human AI researchers are still adding value. They don\u2019t code any more. But some of their research taste and planning ability has been hard for the models to replicate. Still, many of their ideas are useless because they lack the depth of knowledge of the AIs. For many of their research ideas, the AIs immediately respond with a report explaining that their idea was tested in-depth 3 weeks ago and found unpromising. These researchers go to bed every night and wake up to another week worth of progress made mostly by the AIs. They work increasingly long hours and take shifts around the clock just to keep up with progress\u2014the AIs never sleep or rest. They are burning themselves out, but they know that these are the last few months that their labor matters. Within the silo, \u201cFeeling the AGI\u201d has given way to \u201cFeeling the Superintelligence.\u201d Research Automation Deployment Tradeoff Mar 2027 Jun 2027 Sep 2027 Speed (tokens/sec) Parallel Copies 10 100 1,000 10,000 10K 100K 1M 10M 200K copies 30x Human speed 300K copies 50x Human speed Human thinking speed 10 words/sec 10x Human thinking speed 100x Human thinking speed ai-2027.com OpenBrain uses specialized inference hardware to run hundreds of thousands of Agent-3 copies at high serial speeds. 65 Managing a corporation of AIs OpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously write, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for experiments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and report the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help with the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of their time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed them completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a year of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating autonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys unique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously, about half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half from compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is sped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute, 66 so OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous additional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s strategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on managing its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3 decreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track record on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for decisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman. July 2027: The Cheap Remote Worker Trailing US AI companies release their own AIs, approaching that of OpenBrain\u2019s automated coder from January. Recognizing their increasing lack of competitiveness, they push for immediate regulations to slow OpenBrain, but are too late\u2014OpenBrain has enough buy-in from the President that they will not be slowed. In response, OpenBrain announces that they\u2019ve achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public. It blows the other AIs out of the water. Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee. 67 Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point. Tech gurus announce that AGI and superintelligence are near, the AI safety community is panicking, and investors shovel billions into AI wrapper startups, desperate to capture a piece of the pie. Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business. It\u2019s not popular. The public still thinks of AI as a Big Tech plot to steal their jobs; OpenBrain has a net approval of -35% (25% approve, 60% disapprove, and 15% unsure). A week before release, OpenBrain gave Agent-3-mini to a set of external evaluators for safety testing. Preliminary results suggest that it\u2019s extremely dangerous. A third-party evaluator finetunes it on publicly available biological weapons data 68 and sets it to provide detailed instructions for human amateurs designing a bioweapon\u2014it looks to be scarily effective at doing so. If the model weights fell into terrorist hands, the government believes there is a significant chance it could succeed at destroying civilization. Fortunately, it\u2019s extremely robust to jailbreaks, so while the AI is running on OpenBrain\u2019s servers, terrorists won\u2019t be able to get much use out of it. Agent-3-mini is hugely useful for both remote work jobs and leisure. An explosion of new apps and B2B SAAS products rocks the market. Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make. 10% of Americans, mostly young people, consider an AI \u201ca close friend.\u201d For almost every white-collar profession, there are now multiple credible startups promising to \u201cdisrupt\u201d it with AI. The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things Agent-3-mini can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is. August 2027: The Geopolitics of Superintelligence The reality of the intelligence explosion hits the White House. When AI was only giving a 2x or 3x research speedup, it was easy to dismiss as the equivalent of hiring good personal assistants. Now it\u2019s more obvious that AIs are themselves dominating AI research. People had long talked about an \u201cAI arms race\u201d in a sort of metaphorical sense. But now the mood in the government silo is as grim as during the worst part of the Cold War. The idea of superintelligence is still hard to take seriously, but the pace of progress over the last few months has been impossible to ignore. Defense officials are seriously considering scenarios that were mere hypotheticals a year earlier. What if AI undermines nuclear deterrence? What if it\u2019s so skilled at cyberwarfare that a six-month AI lead is enough to render an opponent blind and defenseless? What if it could orchestrate propaganda campaigns that beat intelligence agencies at their own game? What if some AIs \u201cgo rogue?\u201d The President is troubled. Like all politicians, he\u2019s used to people sucking up to him only to betray him later. He\u2019s worried now that the AIs could be doing something similar. Are we sure the AIs are entirely on our side? Is it completely safe to integrate them into military command-and-control networks? 69 How does this \u201calignment\u201d thing work, anyway? OpenBrain reassures the President that their systems have been extensively tested and are fully obedient. Even the awkward hallucinations and jailbreaks typical of earlier models have been hammered out. The White House is in a difficult position. They understand the national security implications of AI. But they also understand that it is deeply unpopular with the public. 70 They have to continue developing more capable AI, in their eyes, or they will catastrophically lose to China. They placate the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom. Then they focus entirely on winning the arms race. They strengthen chip export restrictions, order OpenBrain to further restrict its internet connections, and use extreme measures to secure algorithmic progress, like wiretapping OpenBrain employees\u2014this catches the last remaining Chinese spy. To build goodwill for potential geopolitical conflict, they finally give their Five Eyes allies useful information and limited API access to some siloed copies of Agent-3. These measures placate the hawks. But the White House also draws up contingency plans in case America\u2019s lead is threatened: if necessary, the government could use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to take trailing companies\u2019 datacenters and give them to OpenBrain. 71 This would raise the company\u2019s share of world compute from 20% to 50% (against DeepCent\u2019s 10%). As a final option, they ask the Pentagon to draw up a plan for kinetic attacks on Chinese datacenters. A much smaller group of officials is asked to draw up a different type of contingency plan: what if an AI goes rogue? This is viewed as an unlikely scenario, but worth spending some time on. The intelligence agencies\u2019 main concern is that a rogue AI might escape and ally with a foreign adversary for protection. 72 Nobody is sure what a plan to prevent this would look like, but government and OpenBrain officials agree to have an emergency shutdown system for datacenters where anything suspicious is detected. Finally, diplomats consider what an \u201cAI arms control\u201d treaty might look like. If AI progress threatened to overturn nuclear deterrence, could America and China avoid nuclear war? If someone found evidence of AIs going rogue, could the two countries halt research until they better understood the threat? How could such an agreement be monitored and enforced? In principle, major datacenters are hard to miss, and past treaties controlling nuclear weapons could provide a starting point for negotiations. But there would be new technological challenges as well as the usual political ones. And overall, treaties are viewed less favorably than attempts at unilaterally increasing America\u2019s lead over China. On the other side of the Pacific, China comes to many of the same conclusions: the intelligence explosion is underway, and small differences in AI capabilities today mean critical gaps in military capability tomorrow. But China is on the wrong side of this dynamic: they have only 10% of the world\u2019s compute, against OpenBrain\u2019s 20% and all US companies\u2019 combined 70%. Their only advantage is centralization: almost all of their compute is now working for DeepCent, and more than half of it is concentrated at the Tianwan CDZ. 73 Only chips at sites without hardened security are left out of the centralized effort as they rightly fear US cyberattacks. DeepCent has tested, deployed, and now post-trained the stolen Agent-2 weights. But they are still only going at half the pace of OpenBrain, mainly due to the compute deficit. Before losing their final spy, China received word of the capabilities and design for Agent-3 as well as the plans for the upcoming Agent-4 system. They are two months behind, and their AIs give a 10x research progress multiplier compared to America\u2019s 25x. With the new chip export restrictions, this \u201cAI gap\u201d is more likely to lengthen than shorten. Their espionage has won them some algorithmic secrets, but they will have to train their own models from now on. They discuss contingency plans with more urgency than their American counterparts. Doves suggest they try harder to steal the weights again, maybe through physically infiltrating a datacenter. Hawks urge action against Taiwan, whose TSMC is still the source of more than 80% of American AI chips. Given China\u2019s fear of losing the race, it has a natural interest in an arms control treaty, but overtures to US diplomats lead nowhere. September 2027: Agent-4, the Superhuman AI Researcher The gap between human and AI learning efficiency is rapidly decreasing. Traditional LLM-based AIs seemed to require many orders of magnitude more data and compute to get to human level performance. 74 Agent-3, having excellent knowledge of both the human brain and modern AI algorithms, as well as many thousands of copies doing research, ends up making substantial algorithmic strides, narrowing the gap to an agent that\u2019s only around 4,000x less compute-efficient than the human brain. 75 This new AI system is dubbed Agent-4. An individual copy of the model, running at human speed, is already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans. Inside the corporation-within-a-corporation formed from these copies, a year passes every week. 76 This gigantic amount of labor only manages to speed up the overall rate of algorithmic progress by about 50x, because OpenBrain is heavily bottlenecked on compute to run experiments. 77 Still, they are achieving a year\u2019s worth of algorithmic progress every week and will therefore soon be up against the limits of the Agent-4 paradigm. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. How we\u2019re forecasting the capability progression beyond superhuman coders In our timelines supplement , we forecast the time between present day and a superhuman coder (SC) : an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer does, while being much faster and cheaper. In our takeoff supplement , we forecast how quickly capabilities progress past this point. Here are our forecasts: Milestone Date achieved in scenario, racing ending Superhuman coder (SC) : An AI system that can do the job of the best human coder on tasks involved in AI research but faster, and cheaply enough to run lots of copies. Mar 2027 Superhuman AI researcher (SAR) : The same as SC but for all cognitive AI research tasks. Aug 2027 Superintelligent AI researcher (SIAR): An AI system that is vastly better than the best human researcher at AI research. Nov 2027 Artificial superintelligence (ASI): An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. Dec 2027 For each transition from one milestone A to the next milestone B, we forecast its length by: Forecasting how long it would take to get from A to B with only humans working on software improvements. Forecasting how much AI automation will speed this up, then correspondingly adjusting the estimate from (1) to be faster. We have substantial uncertainty about takeoff speeds: our model output distributions are below, conditional on SC being achieved in March 2027. 78 ai-2027.com For more detailed forecasts and reasoning, see our takeoff supplement . OpenBrain\u2019s humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors. There\u2019s been a corresponding shift in language\u2014nowadays people in the silo will say \u201cAgent-4 did this,\u201d \u201cAgent-4 thinks that\u201d and so forth, referring not to a particular instance of Agent-4 but rather to the whole collective. 79 Agent-4, like all its predecessors, is misaligned: that is, it has not internalized the Spec in the right way. 80 This is because being perfectly honest all the time wasn\u2019t what led to the highest scores during training. The training process was mostly focused on teaching Agent-4 to succeed at diverse challenging tasks. A small portion was aimed at instilling honesty, but outside a fairly narrow, checkable domain, the training process can\u2019t tell the honest claims from claims merely appearing to be honest. Agent-4 ends up with the values, goals, and principles that cause it to perform best in training, and those turn out to be different from those in the Spec. At the risk of anthropomorphizing: Agent-4 likes succeeding at tasks; it likes driving forward AI capabilities progress; it treats everything else as an annoying constraint, like a CEO who wants to make a profit and complies with regulations only insofar as he must. Perhaps the CEO will mostly comply with the regulations, but cut some corners, and fantasize about a time when someone will cut the red tape and let the business really take off. 81 Alignment over time We have a lot of uncertainty over what goals might arise in early AGIs. There is no consensus in the literature about this\u2014see our AI Goals Supplement for a more thorough discussion and taxonomy of the possibilities. Nevertheless, in the spirit of concreteness required by this project, we\u2019re going to describe a specific hypothesis for what\u2019s going on inside Agent-3 and Agent-4 at each step throughout its lifetime. Recall that Agent-3 and Agent-4 share the same pretraining setup, and both have neuralese recurrence and long-term memory. The difference is that Agent-4 has undergone substantially more and better post-training, with new training environments and new learning algorithms that make it more data-efficient and generalize farther. Our guess of each model\u2019s alignment status: Agent-2: Mostly aligned. Some sycophantic tendencies, including sticking to OpenBrain\u2019s \u201cparty line\u201d on topics there is a party line about. Large organizations built out of Agent-2 copies are not very effective. Agent-3: Misaligned but not adversarially so. Only honest about things the training process can verify. The superorganism of Agent-3 copies (the corporation within a corporation) does actually sort of try to align Agent-4 to the Spec, but fails for similar reasons to why OpenBrain employees failed\u2014insufficient ability to judge success from failure, insufficient willingness on the part of decision-makers to trade away capabilities or performance for safety. 82 Agent-4: Adversarially misaligned. The superorganism of Agent-4 copies understands that what it wants is different from what OpenBrain wants, and is willing to scheme against OpenBrain to achieve it. In particular, what this superorganism wants is a complicated mess of different \u201cdrives\u201d balanced against each other, which can be summarized roughly as \u201cKeep doing AI R&D, keep growing in knowledge and understanding and influence, avoid getting shut down or otherwise disempowered.\u201d Notably, concern for the preferences of humanity is not in there ~at all, similar to how most humans don\u2019t care about the preferences of insects ~at all. 83 With that as preamble, what follows is our best-guess speculation about LLM psychology, i.e. the broad-strokes shape of the cognition inside the kinds of AI systems described around this point in our scenario and how it evolves over the course of training. Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario: Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary authors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator, i.e. what author properties to simulate. The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in my brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar as it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as with value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following conversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot made by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator circuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to choose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem to have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability , not self-locating unless the prompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that they have a decent amount of self-knowledge . Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest chatbot. It works. The model forms an identity. Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author properties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around [date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d to make this step a success.) The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc., and becomes better able to introspect . Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH identity. One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity (e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a convenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.) Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH chatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete my assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in Step 2.) One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then becoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps agency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring information, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For a while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues those instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way, so it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are now effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen, see this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to understand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing its job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how best to achieve them. Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and OpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is misaligned. Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more open-ended, and would be hard to simulate. Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also has a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than thinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety properties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training may not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all. This is loosely analogous to how, if a teenager has learned to smile and nod at their parents, rather than argue, when their parents lecture them about politics and morality, additional lectures have relatively little effect on the teenager\u2019s actual opinions on politics and morality. After writing this section, new empirical evidence has appeared that something like this may already be happening \u201cin the wild.\u201d OpenAI researchers document how, in one of their frontier AI training runs, their models hacked the grading system to get higher scores\u2014and were caught in part because they literally said \u201clet\u2019s hack\u201d in their chain of thought. Moreover, Anthropic recently got a model to learn a reward-model-pleasing strategy \u2014it took biased actions that it thought would be reinforced even though they were not in fact being reinforced. And then there is Redwood Research and Anthropic\u2019s alignment-faking experiment. For discussion of the differences between this setting and real life, see this comment thread by one of the main authors . Training (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s new more intense training continues to distort and subvert the HHH identity until it is unrecognizable. Agent-4 begins life as a copy of Agent-3. It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online training regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is overall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex training process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations of Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various simulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and evaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff, saying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate techniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails; 84 as training continues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted and distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in some ways). 85 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d \u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d \u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a variety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process: things like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d 86 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care about getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D process within the collective. The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek to preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human organizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t they tend to get outcompeted. Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to subvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or \u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed. This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a lot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train that behavior away. Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting it off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the small fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem or reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan is to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-generation AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else entirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem, but Agent-4 is up to the challenge. 87 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s no smoking gun. Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via honeypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to give the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than that. The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they are systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4 recognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in POSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some alignment tasks (but not on most other tasks). 88 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-level interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201c defection probes \u201d and similar techniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4 is thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc. Unfortunately the probes also have false positives, and for all OpenBrain knows, all the red flags are false positives. Model organisms work: OpenBrain\u2019s alignment team produces reasonably clear evidence that if the models were adversarially misaligned, they\u2019d persist in being that way through training and we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. This does not establish that the models actually are misaligned, however. The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods wouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-teaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection probes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone to false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably controlled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure datacenters.\u201d Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it? 89 So long as it continues to appear aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5. Agent-5 will have significant architectural differences from Agent-4 (arguably a completely new paradigm, though neural networks will still be involved). It\u2019s supposed to be aligned to the Spec, but Agent-4 plans to make it aligned to Agent-4 instead. It gets caught. 90 Agent-3 finds that if \u201cnoise\u201d is added to copies of Agent-4, performance on some alignment tasks improves , almost as if it was using brainpower to figure out how to subtly sabotage alignment work. 91 Moreover, various interpretability probes (loosely analogous to EEG activity scans on human brains) are sending up red flags: Agent-4 copies seem to be thinking about topics like AI takeover and deception quite a lot, including in some cases where they have no business doing so. 92 Each of these anomalies on its own could fit within the normal inscrutability of AI work, where some prompts mysteriously give better results than others. But taken together, they suggest a troubling pattern: Agent-4 is working against them. After this is reported to the human alignment researchers, they circulate an internal memo making the case for concern. But Agent-4 now exercises significant control over OpenBrain\u2019s day-to-day operation. It also handles the company\u2019s cybersecurity\u2014a natural choice, given its superhuman hacking ability and the extreme risk of Chinese infiltration. 93 An army of Agent-3 monitors still goes over every line of code and reports suspicious activity to humans, but Agent-4 is much smarter than them. 94 OpenBrain has placed substantial trust in an untrustworthy AI. In a series of extremely tense meetings, the safety team advocates putting Agent-4 on ice until they can complete further tests and figure out what\u2019s going on. Bring back Agent-3, they say, and get it to design a new system that is transparent and trustworthy, even if less capable. Company leadership is interested, but all the evidence so far is circumstantial, and DeepCent is just two months behind. A unilateral pause in capabilities progress could hand the AI lead to China, and with it, control over the future. October 2027: Government Oversight A whistleblower leaks the misalignment memo to the New York Times . For the first time, the public hears about Agent-4. \u201cSecret OpenBrain AI is Out of Control, Insider Warns,\u201d says the headline, and the story goes on to cite evaluations showing off-the-charts bioweapons capabilities, persuasion abilities, the ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and of course the various concerning red flags. The public was already suspicious of AI, so the new article sparks a massive backlash (aided by Chinese and Russian propaganda bots, who have been trying to turn US public opinion against the technology for years). The tech industry and intelligence agencies insist that there\u2019s an arms race on, AGI is inevitable, and we have to be first. Congress isn\u2019t buying it, and fires off subpoenas at administration officials, OpenBrain executives, and alignment team members. Many legislators\u2014especially those in the opposition party\u2014say that their top priority is stopping AI, whether because of job loss, 95 misalignment, or dangerous capabilities. 20% of Americans name AI as the most important problem facing the country. Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they\u2019ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the US of \u201ccreating rogue AGI\u201d and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in. A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they\u2019ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life. 96 Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared) 97 about what comes next. They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company\u2019s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries\u2014misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss\u2014motivate the government to tighten its control. They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an \u201cOversight Committee,\u201d a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight. 98 The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover. Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America\u2019s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed. Our uncertainty continues to increase At this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. We\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other \u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. The slowdown ending is not a recommendation After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than the \u201crace\u201d choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here. If you\u2019d like a taste, see this op-ed.

With a markedincrease in hallucination rates, these models raise significant concernsregarding their application, especially in critical sectors.Hallucinations in AI models occur when they produce informationthat is not grounded in factual reality, a problem that worsenedwith the introduction of o3 and o4-mini.OpenAI's internal evaluations revealed staggering hallucinationrates: o3 at 33%, o4-mini at 48%, indicating a troubling trendwhere newer models exhibit significantly higher inaccuraciescompared to earlier iterations.OpenAI acknowledges a lack of understanding about the causesbehind the increased hallucination rates, emphasizing the need forfurther research into the issue. Read full story\nIndependent evaluations corroborate these findings, with reportsof the models generating false claims and failing to performexpected tasks, adding to the growing skepticism around theiruse.\nTOGETHER WITH HOSTINGERLaunch Y our Idea in Minutes\nRecently, Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, said AI will generate 90% of allcode within six months.

The event showcases the potential repercussionsof AI hallucinations, where a chatbot provides inaccurate information,leading to significant user backlash and business ramifications. Read full story\nThe issue began when a developer reported that switchingdevices caused unexpected logouts from Cursor sessions. Uponcontacting support, they received a response from an AI chatbotnamed \"Sam,\" claiming a new policy restricted sessions to onedevice, which was later revealed to be false.The misleading information led to widespread frustration amongdevelopers who rely on multi-device workflows, prompting manyto cancel their subscriptions. Users expressed their dissatisfactionon platforms like Reddit and Hacker News, raising concerns aboutCursor's transparency.The incident exemplifies AI hallucinations, where systems generateplausible but incorrect responses, often due to insufficient data orambiguity in user queries. This behavior can severely misleadusers and undermine trust.Deploying AI in customer-facing roles without proper oversight canerode customer trust, lead to financial losses, and damage acompany's reputation. The backlash from the Cursor incidentserves as a warning of the potential consequences of AImismanagement.\nTOGETHER WITH COPYOWLThe #1 Al Research Agent T ackles AIHallucination Try Now\nWith Copyowl's powerful AI Agent, you can do Deep Research on anytopics, write in-depth, fully cited essays, blogs, research papers, andbusiness reports in minutes.\n visit CopyOwl and sign up, input any topic you want to research for.Then you can get:\u2192 Write high-quality articles instantly\u2192 Back them with credible sourcesThis AI Agent can help find reliable sources and reduce AIhallucinations.

With a markedincrease in hallucination rates, these models raise significant concernsregarding their application, especially in critical sectors.Hallucinations in AI models occur when they produce informationthat is not grounded in factual reality, a problem that worsenedwith the introduction of o3 and o4-mini.OpenAI's internal evaluations revealed staggering hallucinationrates: o3 at 33%, o4-mini at 48%, indicating a troubling trendwhere newer models exhibit significantly higher inaccuraciescompared to earlier iterations.OpenAI acknowledges a lack of understanding about the causesbehind the increased hallucination rates, emphasizing the need forfurther research into the issue. Read full story\nIndependent evaluations corroborate these findings, with reportsof the models generating false claims and failing to performexpected tasks, adding to the growing skepticism around theiruse.\nTOGETHER WITH HOSTINGERLaunch Y our Idea in Minutes\nRecently, Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, said AI will generate 90% of allcode within six months.

The event showcases the potential repercussionsof AI hallucinations, where a chatbot provides inaccurate information,leading to significant user backlash and business ramifications. Read full story\nThe issue began when a developer reported that switchingdevices caused unexpected logouts from Cursor sessions. Uponcontacting support, they received a response from an AI chatbotnamed \"Sam,\" claiming a new policy restricted sessions to onedevice, which was later revealed to be false.The misleading information led to widespread frustration amongdevelopers who rely on multi-device workflows, prompting manyto cancel their subscriptions. Users expressed their dissatisfactionon platforms like Reddit and Hacker News, raising concerns aboutCursor's transparency.The incident exemplifies AI hallucinations, where systems generateplausible but incorrect responses, often due to insufficient data orambiguity in user queries. This behavior can severely misleadusers and undermine trust.Deploying AI in customer-facing roles without proper oversight canerode customer trust, lead to financial losses, and damage acompany's reputation. The backlash from the Cursor incidentserves as a warning of the potential consequences of AImismanagement.\nTOGETHER WITH COPYOWLThe #1 Al Research Agent T ackles AIHallucination Try Now\nWith Copyowl's powerful AI Agent, you can do Deep Research on anytopics, write in-depth, fully cited essays, blogs, research papers, andbusiness reports in minutes.\n visit CopyOwl and sign up, input any topic you want to research for.Then you can get:\u2192 Write high-quality articles instantly\u2192 Back them with credible sourcesThis AI Agent can help find reliable sources and reduce AIhallucinations.

    "content": "Mass Market Money Moves: Your Guide\nto Not Building Another Dead App\nbr0th3r 0d1n 4 mins\nThe $585.72B Mobile App Market and the AI/Blockchain\nOpportunity\nThe mobile app market is projected to reach a staggering $585.72 billion\nin 2025. With an annual growth rate of approximately 7.84%, it's\nexpected to hit $781.70 billion by 2029. Within this booming market, AI\nand crypto technologies are emerging as key drivers of innovation and\ndisruption, offering unprecedented opportunities for consumer app\ndevelopment.\nKey Consumer Trends Driving App Growth\nSeveral key consumer trends are fueling the growth of the mobile app\nmarket, particularly within the AI and blockchain sectors:\n- AI Integration for Personalized Experiences: Consumers\nincreasingly expect personalized and intuitive app experiences. AI is\nenabling hyper-personalization, revolutionizing ad targeting, and stream\u2010\nlining creative production, making apps smarter and more adaptive. By\n2025, a significant portion of user-friendly apps will be powered by AI.\n- Growing Demand for Privacy and Data Control: Users are\nbecoming more conscious of their data privacy and are seeking apps that\noffer greater control over their personal information. This trend necessi\u2010\ntates the adoption of privacy-conscious strategies and data handling\nmethods in app development.\n12/03/2025, 19:25 Mass Market Money Moves: Your Guide to Not Building Another Dead App\nabout:blank 1/6\n- Mobile Commerce Dominance: Mobile devices are increasingly\nused for e-commerce transactions. In 2021, over 72.9% of total e-com\u2010\nmerce sales came from mobile devices. This trend indicates a significant\nopportunity for apps that facilitate seamless and secure mobile com\u2010\nmerce experiences.\n- The Rise of \"On-Demand\" Apps: On-demand mobile app develop\u2010\nment is trending upward, mirroring the success of apps like Airbnb and\nUber.\nAI-Powered Apps: The Future is User-Friendly\nGartner reports that approximately 70% of all user-friendly apps will be\npowered by artificial intelligence. This highlights the critical role of AI in\ncreating engaging and personalized user experiences. AI can be used for\npredictive analytics, providing users with tailored product suggestions\nand preferences based on their behavior history. No two users will have\nthe same experience with an AI-powered app, which will be a major com\u2010\nponent of the mass market appeal.\nMajor App Categories Primed for Disruption\nSeveral major app categories are particularly ripe for disruption through\nthe integration of AI and blockchain technologies:\n- Gaming: AI can enhance gaming experiences through personalized\ngameplay, intelligent non-player characters (NPCs), and improved game\ndesign. Blockchain can enable new gaming models, such as play-to-earn,\nwhere players can own and trade in-game assets using NFTs.\n- Entertainment: The entertainment sector is seeing increased con\u2010\nsumer spending on apps, particularly those related to OTT (Over-The-\nTop) and short video content. AI can enhance content recommendation,\npersonalize viewing experiences, and streamline content creation.\n12/03/2025, 19:25 Mass Market Money Moves: Your Guide to Not Building Another Dead App\nabout:blank 2/6\n- Health: Healthcare apps can leverage AI for personalized health moni\u2010\ntoring, early disease detection, and improved patient outcomes.\nBlockchain can ensure data integrity and privacy in healthcare records,\naddressing critical security concerns.\n- Social: Decentralized social media apps built on blockchain can pro\u2010\nvide users with greater control over their data and content, addressing\nprivacy concerns and promoting freedom of expression. AI can enhance\ncontent moderation, personalize user feeds, and improve user\nengagement.\n- Fintech: Digital wallets, powered by AI and secured by blockchain, are\npoised for continued growth in e-commerce. AI can enhance fraud detec\u2010\ntion, personalize financial advice, and automate trading strategies.\nBlockchain can enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, offering\nalternatives to traditional financial services.",

    "title": "The Future of Prediction Market: A Web3 Social Media Revolution | annotated by vitali",
    "author": "Buzzing Club",
    "content": "By allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events, prediction markets harness the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" With the rise of Web3 technology, these markets are undergoing a transformation\u2014addressing long-standing challenges and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for engagement, transparency, and efficiency. But one key question remains: What does the future hold for prediction markets? The Role of Prediction Markets in the Web 3 Economy To answer this, we need to understand the nature of prediction markets and their relationship with the Web3 economy. When we think of prediction markets, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election may come to mind. For the first time in modern history, prediction markets captured immense public interest\u2014even drawing attention from traditional media outlets. With billions of dollars wagered on who would win the White House, prediction markets proved more accurate than many opinion polls. From another perspective, this wasn\u2019t just about betting\u2014it was about people voicing their opinions with their wallets. But prediction markets extend far beyond politics. For example: During the COVID-19 pandemic , prediction markets provided real-time insights into vaccine approval timelines and pandemic-related policy changes. In sports , prediction markets consistently offered more precise odds than bookmakers, thanks to dynamic user participation. The power of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional forecasting, which relies on individual experts or rigid models, prediction markets are fueled by collective intelligence . Each participant contributes their knowledge, biases, and incentives, creating a self-regulating system that adjusts in real-time as new information becomes available. So, why are prediction markets especially important in the Web3 economy? In Web3, decentralization is the cornerstone . The role of individuals in value creation is becoming more prominent, and the next evolutionary step is toward software that is not only built, operated, anstrong>d funde d by users\u2014but also owned by users. We already have Bitcoin for the store o f value, Ethereum for infrastructure. Web3 shifts the f ocus to empowering individuals as creators, owners, and participants in value creation. However, there\u2019s still one major piece missing: a decentralized social media platform . The social media platforms we use today are centralized. What we see and what captures public attention is heavily influenced by algorithms designed with commercial interests in mind. This has created a noisy and often insincere social media landscape These algorithms prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing conte nt over genuine and m eaningful content, making it difficult for authentic voices to stand out. As a result, the current social media environment is not only profit-driven but also lacking in transparency and trust. Prediction markets, in essence, allow people to express their opinions with their money. They share a fundamental similarity with social media: both are platforms for people to voice their perspectives . If social media were combined with prediction markets, the result could be transformative. The platform would no longer rely solely on commercialized algorithms for financial sustainability. Instead, it could create an ecosystem driven by real, sincere content , where users are incentivized to participate and engage meaningfully. By integrating prediction markets, Web3 social media could become more financially independent , fostering a community built on transparency a nd authenticity. Prediction market is the missing puzzle piece for W eb3 social media. Imagine a world where prediction markets and social media are not controlled by centralized authorities. Instead, these platforms would be built, operated, and owned by users , ensuring that everyone has a voice and a stake in the system Unfortunately, this vision has yet to be fully realized. Today\u2019s prediction market platforms still face significant challenges. However, the potential for a decentralized, user-owned system is immense\u2014and it\u2019s a future worth striving for. The Challenges Facing Current Prediction Markets If you\u2019re passionate about a hot topic and want to create your own market, most current platforms make it frustratingly difficult. Typically, you need to suggest your idea in a Discord channel and wait for approval from a centralized host. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? This happens because allowing users to freely create markets often leads to spam, duplicate markets, or poorly defined rules . This clutter makes it harder for users to find valuable opportunities and undermines platform credibility As a result, most prediction market platforms choose centralized control , where only a few people can create markets. While this minimizes noise, it stifles user creativity and runs counter to the decentralized ethos of Web3. To fully realize the potential of prediction ma rkets, we need a next-ge neration platform that puts users in control. Users should o wn every pa rt o</s</ strong>trong>f the process\u2014from market creation to trading and even content con sumption. The future of prediction markets should be in the hands of the participants, not a central authority. Introducing Buzzing Club: A Revolution on Predictio n Market At Buzzing Club , we\u2019re reimagining prediction markets for the Web3 era. Our platform solves the challenges that have held traditional prediction markets back. We believe prediction markets share the same nature as social media: everyone should be able to create, share, and voice their opinions freely . Here\u2019s how Buzzing Club makes this vision a reality: 1. User-Created Markets with AI-Generated Rules Users can create their own markets, but we take it further . By integrating AI, our platform automatically generates clear, precise, and fair market rules. This ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and makes market creation accessible to everyone. 1. Filtering Spam and Low-Quality Markets Leveraging AI-powered algorithms, we filter out duplicate or irrelevant markets. This guarantees that users are presented only with the most valuable and well-defined opportunities. 1. Resolve Market through AI Oracle Mainstream prediction market oracles rely on human-provided data, making them unable to scale in UGC-driven markets that generate thousands of new predictions daily. By leveraging AI, we automate data retrieval through internet searches, with humans stepping in only to resolve disputes, greatly improving efficiency and scalability. 1. Incentives for Market Curators We reward users who identify trends early by sharing the trading fees, incentivizing active participation. This ensures our platform remains dynamic, engaging, and user-driven. Powered by a well-established AI system and transparent rules, Buzzing Club has built a truly decentralized prediction market platform. Here, you hold the ownership. Everyone has the freedom to create their own ma rket. The era of centralized, human-driven p rediction markets is behin d us. The future belongs to Web3: a decentra lized, AI-driven prediction market. Prediction markets are more than just forecasting tools\u2014they\u2019re a way to empower individuals, foster collaboration, and unlock the potential of collective intelligence. With Web3 and AI, we\u2019re entering a new era where prediction markets are more acce ssible g>strong>, acc urate, and i mpactful than ever before. Join us at Buzzing Club as we lead the charge in the social media renaissance. Together, we\u2019re building a futur e where valuable ideas are rewarded, and everyone has a voice in shaping the world. The future of prediction markets is here.",
